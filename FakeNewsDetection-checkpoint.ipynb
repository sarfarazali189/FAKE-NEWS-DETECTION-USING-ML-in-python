       "['As concern rises over the effect of continuous use of headphones and earbuds on hearing, a new paper by federal researchers has found something unexpected. The prevalence of hearing loss in Americans of working age has declined. The paper, published on Thursday in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology  â\\x80\\x94   Head  Neck Surgery, used data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey, which periodically administers health tests to a representative sample of the population. The investigators, led by Howard J. Hoffman, the director of the epidemiology and statistics program at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, compared data collected between 1999 and 2004 with data from 2011 and 2012, the most recent available. Hearing loss in this study meant that a person could not hear, in at least one ear, a sound about as loud as rustling leaves. The researchers reported that while 15. 9 percent of the population studied in the earlier period had problems hearing, just 14. 1 percent of the more recent group had hearing loss. The good news is part of a continuing trend  â\\x80\\x94   Americansâ\\x80\\x99 hearing has gotten steadily better since 1959. Most surprising to Mr. Hoffman, a statistician, was that even though the total population of   to    grew by 20 million over the time period studied  â\\x80\\x94   and the greatest growth was in the oldest people, a group most likely to have hearing problems  â\\x80\\x94   the total number of people with hearing loss fell, from 28 million to 27. 7 million. Hearing experts who were not associated with the study said they were utterly convinced by the results. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a fantastic paper,â\\x80\\x9d said Brian Fligor, an audiologist with Lantos Technologies of Wakefield, Mass. which develops custom earpieces to protect ears from noise. â\\x80\\x9cI totally believe them. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cInitially, I was surprised,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. Debara Tucci, a professor of otolaryngology at Duke. â\\x80\\x9cBut then I thought about all the reasons why hearing loss might be declining. â\\x80\\x9d It is a long list including the closing of noisy factories, reduced use of medications like some antibiotics that can cause hearing loss, immunizations to prevent childhood illnesses like measles that can affect hearing, and better health in general in the population. In her region, Dr. Tucci said, many patients used to work in noisy textile factories, most of which are now closed. â\\x80\\x9cI used to see a huge amount of   hearing loss,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t see that so much anymore. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hoffman said  â\\x80\\x94   and others agreed  â\\x80\\x94   that although years of exposure to very loud noise can damage hearing, concerns that loud music being played through headphones is diminishing the hearing of a generation are as yet unproven. If there were a headphone connection, it might have shown up as an increase in hearing loss among people in their 20s, because the issue of people wearing headphones for extended periods of time has been around for more than decade. But people in their 20s had no more hearing loss than people that age a decade ago. â\\x80\\x9cWe are going to keep studying this,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hoffman said. The study found that men  â\\x80\\x94   at all ages  â\\x80\\x94   were more likely to have hearing problems than women, and that the greatest risk factor for hearing loss was age. While the new data is gratifying, Mr. Hoffman cautioned that hearing loss remains a problem. â\\x80\\x9cThis doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean we have prevented hearing loss,â\\x80\\x9d he stressed. â\\x80\\x9cIt just means it is delayed. â\\x80\\x9d Still, other researchers said the declining prevalence of hearing loss was part of a broad health trend internationally, with almost every major disease and disability on the wane and occurring later in life. The hearing loss data, said James Vaupel, director, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany, â\\x80\\x9cis consistent with other research showing a delay in aging. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe evidence suggests that 70 is the new 60,â\\x80\\x9d Dr. Vaupel said, â\\x80\\x9cwith health and mortality of    today being similar to the health and mortality trends of    half a century ago. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'The Republicans have given us a lot of  WTF  moments lately, but this one is something you ll remember for a while   and just in time for Easter.Earlier today, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) released a video over Twitter announcing what he gave up for Lent, a Christian tradition during Easter season where people give up specific comforts and luxuries for 40 days as a form of repentance. After you see this, the levels of rage you ll experience will make you wish Ryan had just kept it between himself and the Lord. Seriously, the smug smile on his face is enough to make you sick:I used to give up food, like beer or ice cream, for #Lent. But this year, I decided to give up something different.https://t.co/1CBygHRoG1  Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) March 24, 2016So what did Ryan decide to forego for several weeks? Anxiety. And impatience. He s dead serious. In the video, he said: I used to give up beer, or ice cream, or pop. But I ve given up so many things over the years, food-wise, that I ve decided to switch my Lenten vows to character deficiencies or problems I ve had. For Ryan to refer to anxiety as a  character deficiency  is reprehensible. It is something that around 40 million American adults suffer from regularly, and can lead to serious physical issues such as ulcers and respiratory problems.Ryan, with his amazing amount of white privilege and insensitivity, referred to the everyday stresses that many Americans face as an actual debilitating disorder. How nice is it that Ryan can CHOOSE to give up anxiety for 40 days? People who actually suffer from anxiety don t even have that choice, and would probably give anything to live without anxiety for just ONE day. What Ryan said has only further stigmatized a real mental health issue.The stigma against mental health is a serious matter in this country. As discussions about mental health are usually delivered in a punch line or decried in public, it s no surprise that only a quarter of those with mental health issues believe that others understand and are compassionate about their condition. Because of heavily engrained stereotypes about mental illness, many people will never seek treatment and get the help they need.Maybe if Ryan is looking for more Lent ideas, he could give up shaming people. At least that s a real  character deficiency. Featured image via Getty Images',\n",

       " 'BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders appealed for unity in a last-ditch effort to break their deadlock on sharing out refugees by June, telling reluctant eastern states they could otherwise be outvoted on a dispute that has shaken the bloc s foundations. Coming out from a fraught discussion among 28 EU leaders that went into the small hours on Friday morning in Brussels, rivals in the two-year-old dispute all stuck to their guns, hemmed in by expectations they have raised with their own voters. The Mediterranean frontline states Italy and Greece, and the rich destination countries including Germany, Sweden, Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are demanding that all countries host some refugees as a way to demonstrate solidarity. Their four ex-communist peers Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic refuse to accept people from the mostly-Muslim Middle East and North Africa, saying that would threaten their security after a raft of Islamic attacks in Europe.   There are areas where there is no solidarity and this is something I find unacceptable,  German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters. At one point during the two days of talks in Brussels, cameras caught Merkel, the bloc s paramount national leader, as she appeared to become agitated when talking with the leaders  chairman, Donald Tusk, making her displeasure with him clear. That came after Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland,  came out strongly against  ineffective  and  highly divisive  obligatory refugee quotas, ruffling the feathers of those states that back them as well as the executive European Commission.  The manner in which the principle of solidarity was being questioned does not only undermine the discussion on the refugee issue, but the future of Europe,  Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told reporters after what he called  intense  talks. Tusk said the ineffectiveness of relocation schemes was demonstrated by the fact that only 35,000 asylum seekers had been transferred from Greece and Italy under a 2015 plan meant to move 160,000 people.  Mandatory quotas remain a contentious issue,  Tusk told a joint news conference with the Commission s head Jean-Claude Juncker, the disagreement between the two playing out visibly despite their usually friendly rapport.  Relocation is not a solution to the issue of illegal migration.   Will a compromise be possible? It appears very hard. But we have to try our very best,  he said, stressing the bloc was in full agreement about making further efforts to tighten its borders and chip in for development and migration-related projects in the Middle East and Africa. After sealing a deal with Ankara in 2016 that cut off arrivals from Turkey to EU state Greece, the bloc is now pushing to stem African immigration to Italy through Libya.  Tusk, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and other leaders said they wanted to make permanent financing available for such activities in the bloc s next long-term budget from 2021. But it is the feud over how to share the burden of caring for those refugees who still make it to Europe that has weakened the bloc s cohesion and undermined member states  trust in each other at a time they need unity to face Brexit. After many months of letting the open wound fester, the backers of quotas made clear they want to move on and would vote on the broader reform of the bloc s asylum system by majority if no compromise acceptable for all is found by June on relocation.   I am not a fan of qualified majority decision-taking but... it can be used,  Juncker said.  Some of our colleagues were openly saying yesterday night that if there is no progress, they will propose qualified majority decision-making procedure.  That would inevitably deepen divisions in the EU and the four eastern states warned that the bloc would shoot itself in the foot should it go down this track.  The only proposal the EU has on the table on asylum reform has most recently been updated by Estonia and attempts to bridge the divide by proposing that any relocation of asylum-seekers from one EU state to another, while obligatory at times of extremely high arrivals, would in fact only take place if both involved agreed voluntarily to the terms. Diplomats in Brussels hoped Italy would be more willing to compromise after it holds elections, most likely in March, and said Germany could reassume the lead on the file after it forms a ruling coalition following an election last September. A senior EU diplomat from one of the pro-quota countries said they would seek to break the united front of the four eastern states to bring down the number of countries that would eventually be defeated in a vote if everything else fails.

       " 'The entitled refugee mentality is becoming the norm in bleeding heart nations around the world. We recently reported about complaints from Italian citizens that refugees were dumping garbage in the streets of Italy to protest poor wi-fi. In Germany, an Afghan family refused to get off the bus at their new government funded flat, after complaining they were promised a home.Immigrant Services Association of Nova Scotia says staff thoroughly inspected an apartment to ensure it was bedbug-free before moving in a family of six Syrian refugees on Feb. 1.Director of operations Gerry Mills said families are moved into safe and appropriate housing, and ISANS staff keep the health and well-being of refugees in mind. Our staff know what bedbugs look like and since Friday we ve had staff there every day in different apartments, honestly trying to look for bedbugs. We have found not one bedbug,  she said.On Tuesday, Ziad Zeina told CBC News through an interpreter that he wanted to get his family out of their two-bedroom apartment on Gerrish Street because the bedbug problem  is non-stop and it s not going to change and there s no solution at this moment. But Mills said one of the first steps workers take is to inquire with building managers whether the biting pests are a problem on site.In the case of Harbour View Apartments where the Zeinas live, Mills said building managers took the preventive step of fumigating their unit even though it did not have bedbugs. You can actually tell because there s still kind of an actual vague smell in them [apartments],  Mills said.Or was it a pre-existing skin condition?Wafaa Al Safadi holds her 10-month-old son, Rayan Zeina. She says he is covered in bed bug bites. (Elizabeth Chiu/CBC)The Zeinas are government-assisted refugees who stayed briefly in Charlottetown and decided to settle in Halifax at the end of January.The family insists there s a bedbug issue and Wafaa Al Safadi lifted her baby s shirt to reveal his chest and back covered in scabs and red rashes.But Mills said the baby has a pre-existing skin condition. The marks were on the child even before they moved into that apartment. When they were in the hotel, we spoke with the family then about taking the child to the doctor to get some medication. ISANS said there are 16 families of Syrian refugees living in the same building and no other families have complained about the blood-sucking insects. Via: CBC ',\n",

Can you get me off?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUltimately, the prosecutionâ\\x80\\x99s case fell apart for a number of reasons, including investigators mishandling evidence of bloody underwear, so in a plea agreement the charges were reduced from first-degree rape to unlawful fondling of a minor under the age of 14. Not until 2008 did the victim, Kathy Shelton, realize that Clinton had been the lawyer on the other side. She has since attacked Clinton for putting â\\x80\\x9cme through hell,â\\x80\\x9d and she appeared at a news event with Trump before the debate.\\n\\nThe rape case reemerged when the Washington Free Beacon in 2014 discovered unpublished audio recordings from the mid-1980s of Clinton being interviewed by Arkansas reporter Roy Reed for an article that was never published.\\n\\nIn the recorded interview, Clinton is heard laughing or giggling four times when discussing the case with unusual candor; the reporter is also heard laughing, and sometimes Clinton is responding to him.\\n\\nHere are the four instances:\\n\\nPaula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, alleged that in 1991 Clinton, while governor, propositioned her and exposed himself. She later filed a sexual harassment suit. The case was dismissed by a federal judge, who ruled that even if her allegations were true, such â\\x80\\x9cboorish and offensiveâ\\x80\\x9d behavior would not be severe enough to constitute sexual harassment under the law. That ruling was under appeal when Clinton in 1998 settled the suit for $850,000, with no apology or admission of guilt. All but $200,000 was directed to pay legal fees.\\n\\nPremiums are expected to increase overall in 2017,Â\\xa0but Trump is cherry-picking from the highest proposed increases in the insurance marketplace.\\n\\nState-by-state weighted average increases range from just 1.3 percent in Rhode Island to as high as 71 percent in Oklahoma. ButÂ\\xa0the most common plans in the marketplace will see an average increase of 9 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundationâ\\x80\\x99sÂ\\xa0July analysis.Â\\xa0These plans have been used as the benchmark to calculate government subsidies.\\n\\nThe vast majority of marketplace enrollees (about eight in 10) receive government premium subsidies. They areÂ\\xa0protected from a premium increase (and may even see a decrease) if they stay with a low-cost plan. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation,Â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9canecdotal examples of premium hikes or averages across insurers can provide a skewed picture of the increases marketplace enrollees will actually face.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo support the debunked notion that Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s campaign originated â\\x80\\x9cbirtherâ\\x80\\x9d rumors during the 2008 presidential campaign, Trump once again referenced longtime Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal andÂ\\xa0Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle. But heâ\\x80\\x99s grasping at straws â\\x80\\x94 and once again refused to apologize for his own role in promoting the birther fable.\\n\\nJames Asher, former D.C. bureau chief of McClatchy, has said that Blumenthal â\\x80\\x9cstrongly urgedâ\\x80\\x9d him to â\\x80\\x9cinvestigate the exact place of President Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s birth, which he suggested was in Kenya.â\\x80\\x9d McClatchy assigned a reporter to go to Kenya, and the reporter found the allegation was false, Asher said. (We reached out to Asher several times but did not receive a response.)\\n\\nBlumenthal, declining to elaborate further, said in a statement to The Fact Checker: â\\x80\\x9cThis is false. Period. Donald Trump cannot distract from the fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie, and bears the responsibility for it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSolis Doyle saidÂ\\xa0in a recent CNN interview that in December 2007, a volunteer coordinator in Iowa forwarded an email perpetuating the birther conspiracy. Clinton â\\x80\\x9cmade the decision immediately to let that person go,â\\x80\\x9d Solis Doyle said in the interview.\\n\\nAs in the instance with the Iowa volunteer coordinator, the campaign denounced isolated instances of Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s staffers questioning whether Obama was Muslim. We found that thereâ\\x80\\x99s no evidence that she or her campaign were â\\x80\\x9cpressing it very hardâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 though some of her supporters did perpetuate the claims in the bitter 2008 primary campaign against Obama.\\n\\nTrump has used this line of attack throughout the campaign, sometimes saying Hillary Clinton was an â\\x80\\x9cenablerâ\\x80\\x9d of her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s affairs, saying she would â\\x80\\x9cgo after these women and destroy their lives.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOne of the interviews that Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s critics have pointed to is a Jan. 27, 1998, interview on the â\\x80\\x9cTodayâ\\x80\\x9d show, saying it showed Clinton was discrediting allegations by then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. This interview took place a week after her husband was accused of having an affair with Lewinsky, and Clinton blamed Republican foes for making false attacks against her husband.\\n\\nSpecifically, critics have pointed to this quote by Clinton:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI mean, look at the very people who are involved in this, they have popped up in other settings,â\\x80\\x9d Clinton told Matt Lauer. â\\x80\\x9cThis is the great story here, for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it, is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis interview, by many accounts, was certainly pivotal to saving Bill Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s presidency, as his wife forcefully backed him. But by Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s account at the time, her husband had not yet admitted the Lewinsky affair to her. That did not happen until Aug. 15, 1998, according to her memoir.\\n\\nMoreover, at the time of the interview, Lewinsky also denied there had been a relationship. Her lawyer had submitted an affidavit on Jan. 12 from her saying she â\\x80\\x9cnever had a sexual relationship with the president.â\\x80\\x9d Lewinsky did not begin to testify before the independent prosecutor about the full extent of the relationship until July 27, six months after the â\\x80\\x9cTodayâ\\x80\\x9d show interview. Lewinsky testified for 15 days, after which the president finally confessed to his wife.\\n\\nSee our in-depth fact-checks on this here and here.\\n\\nWhile Trump has ramped up the attacks on the Clintons and the sex allegations against Bill Clinton, the record shows that Trump dismissed or minimized these very allegations for many years. Trump dismissed the women involved as losers and not attractive. Trump even suggested that Americans would have been more forgiving if Clinton had slept with more beautiful women.\\n\\nHere are some examples (see more here):\\n\\nIn 1998, Trump attacked Paula Jones, who had sued Clinton, alleging sexual harassment: â\\x80\\x9cPaula Jones is a loser, but the fact is that she may be responsible for bringing down a president indirectly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn 1999, Trump faulted Bill Clinton for the way he handled the Lewinsky scandal, and complained about his choice in women: â\\x80\\x9cHe handled the Monica situation disgracefully. Itâ\\x80\\x99s sad because he would go down as a great president if he had not had this scandal. People would have been more forgiving if heâ\\x80\\x99d had an affair with a really beautiful woman of sophistication. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe were on a different level. Now Clinton canâ\\x80\\x99t get into golf clubs in Westchester. A former president begging to get in a golf club. Itâ\\x80\\x99s unthinkable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDuring a 2001 interview, Trump again expressed sympathy for Bill Clinton, arguing that the former presidentâ\\x80\\x99s biggest mistake was answering questions about his sex life. Trump said he likes Clinton, and finds it all too easy to understand why the then-president found it hard to answer the question: â\\x80\\x9cDid you fâ\\x80\\x94 Monica?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat he should have done is fought for years not to answer it,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said in the interview. â\\x80\\x9cI mean, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it amazing and terrible that a guy â\\x80\\x94 a president â\\x80\\x94 is put in that position? He could have gone down as truly great and, instead, you know, heâ\\x80\\x99ll be viewed somewhat differently, which is really a shame.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTrump always makes it sound like this is U.S. taxpayer money â\\x80\\x94 and he always uses a too-high estimate. Because of international sanctions over its nuclear program, Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe. With sanctions lifted, in theory those funds would be unlocked.\\n\\nBut the Treasury Department has estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. (Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China.) For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion, not $55 billion.\\n\\nThere is no evidence this was the case in the 2015 Â\\xa0terrorist attack that killed 14 people. There have been unconfirmed second- or third-hand reports â\\x80\\x94 a friend of a friend of a neighbor â\\x80\\x94 that a neighbor claimed to have noticed suspicious activity but did not report anything for fear of doing racial profiling. The religion of this supposed neighbor is unknown, but presumably a fear of racial profiling would suggest the neighbor was not Muslim.\\n\\nTrump is technically correct on the timeline, but Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s staff had requested the emails to be deleted months before the subpoena, according to the FBIâ\\x80\\x99s August 2016 report. Moreover, thereâ\\x80\\x99s no evidence Clinton deleted the emails in anticipation of the subpoena, and FBI director James B. Comey has said his agencyâ\\x80\\x99s investigation found no evidence that any work-related emails were â\\x80\\x9cintentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPolitiFact compiled a helpful timeline of events relating to Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s release of her emails, based on the FBI report. From their timeline:\\n\\nOn July 23, 2014, the State Department agreed to produce records pertaining to the 2012 attacks in Libya, for the House Select Committee on Benghaziâ\\x80\\x99s investigation. In December 2014, Clinton aide Cheryl Mills told an employee of the company that managed her server to delete emails on her server unrelated to government work that were older than 60 days.\\n\\nOn March 4, 2015, the Benghazi Committee issued a subpoena requiring Clinton to turn over her emails relating to Libya. Three weeks later, between March 25 and March 31, the employee had an â\\x80\\x9coh sâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d moment and realized he did not delete the emails that Mills requested in December 2014, he told the FBI. The employee then deleted the emails and used a program called BleachBit to delete the files.\\n\\nThis is just totally false.\\n\\nWe have found no evidence of his early opposition. Trump expressed lukewarm support the first time he was asked about it on Sept. 11, 2002, and was not clearly against it until he was quoted in the August 2004 Esquire cover story titled, â\\x80\\x9cDonald Trump: How Iâ\\x80\\x99d Run the Country (Better).â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut by the middle of 2004, many Americans had turned against the war, making Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s position not particularly unique. In light of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s repeated false claim, Esquire has added an editorâ\\x80\\x99s note to its August 2004 story, saying, â\\x80\\x9cThe Iraq War began in March 2003, more than a year before this story ran, thus nullifying Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s timeline.â\\x80\\x9d We have awarded this claim Four Pinocchios, compiled a timeline of all of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s comments prior to the invasion in March 2003, and even a video documenting how this is a bogus claim.\\n\\nTrumpÂ\\xa0is simply wrong when he says the United States is the highest-taxed nation in the world.\\n\\nThe Pew Research Center, using 2014 data, found that the tax bill for Americans, under various scenarios, is below average for developed countries.\\n\\nIn 2014, according to comparative tables of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product â\\x80\\x94 the broadest measure of the economy â\\x80\\x94 was 26 percent for the United States. Out of 34 countries, that put the United States in the bottom third â\\x80\\x94 and well below the OECD average of 34.4 percent.\\n\\nClinton overstated the impact of the 2011 New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) agreement, which she helped negotiate as secretary of state.\\n\\nNew START placed tighter limits on deployed strategic weapons, but Russia was actually already meeting the treatyâ\\x80\\x99s limits, for the most part, when the treatyâ\\x80\\x99s implementation began. Indeed, Russia has increased deployed nuclear weapons from 1,537 in February 2011 to 1,796 in September of this year. Also, the treaty does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons, nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons.\\n\\nRussiaâ\\x80\\x99s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline, from 40,000, since 1986. During Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s presidency, Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s nuclear warhead total has hovered around 4,500 since 2012.\\n\\nTrump cites an Internal Revenue Service audit as his justification for not releasing his federal income tax returns, but the audit does not prohibit from releasing the returns. Richard Nixon, who started the tradition of presidents and presidential candidates releasing their returns, did so in the middle of an audit.\\n\\nMoreover, Trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009, which are no longer under audit, according to his attorney.\\n\\nPresidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns, but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency. Hillary Clinton has released three decadesâ\\x80\\x99 worth of tax returns.\\n\\nThe toppling of Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi â\\x80\\x94 at the hands of Libyan rebels aided by U.S. and NATO air power â\\x80\\x94 has led to highly unstable governance as the countryâ\\x80\\x99s tribes have vied for influence and power. There are rival governments based in the capital of Tripoli and the eastern city of Tobruk, and neither has fully recognized the â\\x80\\x9cunityâ\\x80\\x9d government established by United Nations mediators.\\n\\nThe National Oil Corporation (NOC) claims to be operating independently without taking orders from either of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s rival governments, though a rival NOC appears to have been set up in the east. ISIS has attempted to step into the power vacuum. But not a single expert or news article that we consulted said that ISIS has grabbed a single oil field. Instead, militants appear to be trying to disrupt the flow of oil, mainly by scaring workers away.\\n\\nClaudia Gazzini, a Tripoli-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, told The Fact Checker it was not true that the Islamic State has control of any Libyan oil.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhile it is true that ISIS has attacked oil fields in the Sirte basin area and destroyed key equipment there, they have not sought to keep control of the oil fields,â\\x80\\x9d Gazzini said. â\\x80\\x9cAt the moment they appear to have adopted a hit-and-run strategy. There is no evidence that they are pumping out the crude oil and certainly no evidence that they are trading it. At the moment they just appear interested in starving the Libyan state of oil revenues.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTrump made a ludicrous claim that U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens made 600 requests for help before he perished in the September 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi. This is a misunderstanding of a figure widely used by Republicans on the House Select Committee on Benghazi, but even they never claimed that these came from Stevens.\\n\\nThe Fact Checker delved deeply into this â\\x80\\x9c600â\\x80\\x9d figure. It is a subjective accounting of â\\x80\\x9crequests and concerns,â\\x80\\x9d not actual requests for help. There is no dispute that security was inadequate in Benghazi and that the State Department failed to respond to all requests for security. But the shorthand description of â\\x80\\x9c600 requestsâ\\x80\\x9d has left a misleading impression â\\x80\\x94 so much so that many reporters and lawmakers appearÂ\\xa0to believe that all of these requests were ignored. At least some of the requests were actually fulfilled â\\x80\\x94 and the counting of â\\x80\\x9cconcernsâ\\x80\\x9d may be subject to dispute.\\n\\nHomicides were up 10.8 percent nationwide in 2015, the biggest percentage jump in a single year since 1971, according to FBI data. But violent crimes overall have been declining for about two decades, and are far below rates seen one or two decades ago.\\n\\nHomicides have continued to spike in major cities this year, though the rates remain far below their peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Law enforcement officials, including the FBI, have voiced concerns about the uptick in crime in 2015.\\n\\nCriminal justice experts warn against comparing crime trends from short periods of time, such as year over year. An annual trend can show a trajectory of where the trend might be headed but still not give a full picture. Many criminal justice experts say crime trends are determined over at least five years, preferably 10 or 20 years, of data.\\n\\nTrump takes Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s statement out of context. During a March 2016 town hall,Â\\xa0Clinton was asked by a voter: â\\x80\\x9cMake the case to poor whites who live in Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, who vote Republican, why they should vote for you based upon economic policies versus voting for a Republican?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nClinton gave a lengthy response, which included the line, â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.â\\x80\\x9d It was part of her longer answer about how transitioning away from coal-powered plants has already affected mining communities, and her plan to help coal mine workers adjust after losing factory jobs, as explained in her November 2015 policy proposal for revitalizing coal communities.\\n\\nHereâ\\x80\\x99s her full answer. The portion that Trump cited is in bold.\\n\\nThis is easy to disprove. Letâ\\x80\\x99s look at the tweet, sent at 5:30 a.m. regarding former Miss Universe Alicia Machado:\\n\\nTrump claims that Machado is â\\x80\\x9cno angel.â\\x80\\x9d No sex tape has surfaced since Trump sent out the late-night tweet. But he clearly tweeted that people should â\\x80\\x9ccheck out sex tape.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s unclear what Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s source is on this one, and his campaign did not respond to our inquiry. In 2015, 24 percent of black people lived below poverty levels, according to the Census. Black people had the highest rate of poverty among all racial groups (21 percent of Hispanics, 11 percent of Asians and 11.6 percent of whites).\\n\\nMoreover, the majority of black people do not live in the â\\x80\\x9cinner city,â\\x80\\x9d as the NAACP tweeted during the debate.\\n\\nResearch shows that as of 2010, the majority of blacks, Asians and Latinos in metropolitan areas lived in the suburbs.\\n\\nCoal is not clean. When burned in power plants, it emits sulfur dioxides, nitrous oxides and mercury unless coal-fired power plants have scrubbers to remove those from the air, thanks to regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency that Trump said was â\\x80\\x9cso restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCoal also emits carbon dioxide, which the Supreme Court in 2007 said was a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. That carbon dioxide can only be removed from emissions at great cost, and the technique is not currently in use except in areas where it can be used for enhanced oil recovery.\\n\\nFinally, the act of mining coal is not clean. It either involves open-pit mines or underground mines that often pollute waters. And coal-fired power plants also produce coal ash waste that is often kept in ponds that are prone to leaking.\\n\\nProbably the major reason for the decline in coal use is the discovery of a way to tap into shale gas, which has brought down the price of natural gas. Many utilities are switching to natural gas.\\n\\nActually, the United States is still a net importer of crude oil and refined petroleum products. It imported 5.3 million barrels a day in July, according to the Energy Information Administration. That is, however, down sharply from the 13 million barrels a day of imports reached in 2006.\\n\\nClinton went onto say, â\\x80\\x9cWe are not dependent upon the Middle East.â\\x80\\x9d Thatâ\\x80\\x99s correct, but itâ\\x80\\x99s been the case for years. Canada is the biggest source for American oil imports â\\x80\\x94Â\\xa0more than the entire Persian Gulf combined.\\n\\nThis is wrong. The Obama administration has admitted 12,500 refugees over the past fiscal year, which slightly exceeded a goal of 10,000. Even so, this is about one-third accepted by Canada, with a much smaller population.\\n\\nTrump in the past has claimed that Clinton wants to admit 620,000 refugees in her first term. Clinton has supported accepting up to 65,000 refugees from Syria in one year. This is 55,000 more than the Obama administrationâ\\x80\\x99s plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year.\\n\\nThe 620,000 figure that Trump often uses is based in the unverified assumption that Clinton would continue at that pace for every year of her first term, on top of the Obama administrationâ\\x80\\x99s proposal for 100,000 total refugees for fiscal year 2017. (Multiply 155,000 four times and you reach 620,000.) After Trump made his comment about â\\x80\\x9chundreds of thousands,â\\x80\\x9d moderator Martha Raddatz deftly noted that Clinton had asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000.\\n\\nClintonâ\\x80\\x99s talking point is out of date. The Census Bureau reported in September that median income was up 5.2 percent from 2014 to 2015, to $56,516. This is the first annual increase in median household income since 2007, the year before the Great Recession.\\n\\nThe United States has a trade deficit of about $500 billion in goods and services. Trump appears to be referring the deficit in goods, which was nearly $800 billion in 2015, according to the Census Bureau.\\n\\nThis is not the full story. The federal government weighed several factors when considering bids for redevelopment of the Old Post Office building: 50 percent were qualitative (including past performance of the developer, site plan and design concept) and 50 percent were quantitative (developerâ\\x80\\x99s financial capability and capacity and the developerâ\\x80\\x99s financial offer).\\n\\nTwo factors weighed heavily in Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s favor: the financial backing of major real estate investor Colony Capital and the design by prominent architect Arthur Cotton Moore.\\n\\nTrump had submitted the bid with Colony Capital as the financial backer, and the Trump Organization as the lead developer. The Washington Postâ\\x80\\x99s Jonathan Oâ\\x80\\x99Connell wrote: â\\x80\\x9cColony is a major global investor in real estate, which bolstered Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s efforts to secure the deal. At the time, Colony had already invested $45 billion in more than 14,000 corporate and real estate assets, ranking it among the top real estate investment firms worldwide.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut after the Trump Organization won the bid, Colony Capital backed out of the deal, saying that â\\x80\\x9cthe projectâ\\x80\\x99s timeline became too long for the firm.â\\x80\\x9d The Trumps instead contributed $40 million to $42 million in equity and borrowed $170 million from Deutsche Bank.\\n\\nThe selection of Moore â\\x80\\x9cbolstered the organizationâ\\x80\\x99s experience restoring or managing historic buildings in New York,â\\x80\\x9d Oâ\\x80\\x99Connell wrote. Moore stepped down from the project less than a year after Trump won the bid. He told the New York Times: â\\x80\\x9cI left because I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t support what they were doing to the building. They were covering up or tearing out everything that was historic.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\\n\\nCheck out our guide to all Trump and Clinton fact checks\\n\\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter',\n",
       " 'Never let an opportunity go to waste. Its the Democrat mantra Whenever a black person dies, no matter what the circumstances, the first and most important question is: How can Al Sharpton turn this into dollars? With the death of funk/pop icon Prince yesterday, you re probably thinking there is no way the race-hustling Reverend can turn the tragedy into social justice (AKA cold hard cash) but you re underestimating his awesome powers of exploitation.The Amsterdam News reports that Al Sharpton will be holding a rally on Saturday at the National Action Network s House of Justice in New York. I m not kidding, he really has a place he calls the  House of Justice.  The original purpose of this rally was to protest the police shooting a black guy who pointed a gun at officers, but with Prince s untimely death, Sharpton has decided to combine faux outrage with a faux tribute.Here s the black guy who was  wronged  by a racist system:Tillman was fatally shot by NYPD officers on Sunday in Ozone Park, Queens. Reports indicate that he was allegedly holding an open alcohol container when officers approached him. Tillman had a gun on his waistband and allegedly ran as they approached him. Police say he reached for the weapon before officers opened fire shooting Tillman in the chest. He was pronounced dead at Jamaica Medical Center.Let s see if I have this correctly: A black guy was carrying an illegal firearm in NYC and violating the city s drinking in public law. When police tried to question him, he resisted arrest and took off. He then took out the illegal firearm and pointed it at officers and they responded by shooting him. In other words, police used appropriate force to deal with a violent life-threatening situation. How exactly is this a case of racial injustice? Oh, because the guy was black. I get it now.I guess it s getting harder and harder for Sharpton to find any real racism to rage against, so he has to work with what he s got.Just in case people have a hard time freaking out over a justified police shooting, Big Al is throwing in a tribute to Prince to get asses in the seats:As the aftermath of the death of singer Prince continues, Sharpton will conduct a special memorial in honor of the legendary entertainer and humanitarian.I wasn t aware there was  aftermath  from Prince s death, but it sure does seem like a shitty tribute to combine this with some bogus racial outrage over a guy who got shot for trying to kill some cops.Really the only question left is: how will Sharpton blame Prince s death on white supremacy? Was there a white conspiracy to kill the singer? Did he die because white EMTs responded slower than they would have if Prince were white? Did a white man give him the flu and force him to take opioids?Via: DownTrend ',\n",
       " 'SAN DIEGO  â\\x80\\x94   The   dressed in yellow and brown on Monday, making the field at Petco Park look, from above, like a grill full of cheeseburgers. The homage to the host San Diego Padres, who once wore similar uniforms, helped distinguish Home Run Derby day from every other day of this curious baseball season. Home runs are up. Way, way up. Baseball arrived at the   break with hitters on pace for more than 5, 600 home runs, a level exceeded only once in history: in 2000, at the height of the steroid era. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d like to say that guys arenâ\\x80\\x99t cheating,â\\x80\\x9d said Stephen Vogt, the Oakland Athleticsâ\\x80\\x99 catcher. â\\x80\\x9cEverybodyâ\\x80\\x99s going to speculate  â\\x80\\x94   right?  â\\x80\\x94   when the home run numbers go up. But we are cleaning up the game, and I hope thatâ\\x80\\x99s not the reason behind it. â\\x80\\x9d Before 2003, when baseball began testing for   drugs, we searched for reasons to explain the surge in home runs. Expansion, smaller ballparks and better nutrition all played a part  â\\x80\\x94   but history, rightly, gave steroids most of the blame. So what now? Besides Dee Gordon  â\\x80\\x94   last yearâ\\x80\\x99s National League leader in batting average and steals  â\\x80\\x94   the players caught in this seasonâ\\x80\\x99s drug net have mostly been marginal. Perhaps some sluggers are beating the system, but a widespread cheating epidemic seems unlikely. But something is happening. Two years ago, there were 4, 186 home runs, or 0. 86 per team per game. That was the lowest figure in any of the last 20 full seasons, dating to 1996. This season, there are 1. 16 homers per team per game, up from 1. 01 in 2015. Put another way, at the current pace, home runs will rise by more than 700 over the previous season for the second year in a row. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a lot more balls soaring over fences, and one pitcher is keeping his theories private. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not going to be the one who throws that stone,â\\x80\\x9d said Washington Nationals starter Max Scherzer, who leads the National League in homers allowed. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not going to sit here and say anything and make accusations. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not the way you do things. But if they are up significantly, it would be interesting to see what M. L. B. actually thinks about it. â\\x80\\x9d Mike Teevan, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, said the league does â\\x80\\x9cextensive reviews of the performance of the baseball, and there have been no differencesâ\\x80\\x9d to explain the increase in homers. Strikeouts, said starter Jon Lester of the Chicago Cubs, are also rising, and hitters are taking a different approach. â\\x80\\x9cI know our hitting coach wants you to hit the ball in the air,â\\x80\\x9d Lester said. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no slug on the ground. Guys are willing to take their   to hit the ball in the air, and swing hard in case they hit it. â\\x80\\x9d That theory would seem to make sense, especially as hitters react to the increasing use of extreme infield shifts. Yet the overall percentage of fly balls has not risen. According to Fangraphs, it is 34. 2 percent now only two of the past 15 seasons have been lower. What has changed is that a greater percentage of fly balls are turning into home runs. At 12. 9 percent, that figure is the highest it has been since Fangraphs started tracking the statistic in 2002. At least in one sense, perhaps, throwing harder may be working against pitchers. â\\x80\\x9cSecondary stuff isnâ\\x80\\x99t as big of a thing as it used to be, I feel like,â\\x80\\x9d Baltimore Orioles catcher Matt Wieters said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s now, â\\x80\\x98Can you throw 98, 99?â\\x80\\x99 And a lot of breaking balls that are hanging end up getting hit out. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s my theory: The types of arms that are getting moved through the system are guys that can really throw hard, and command sometimes comes later for them. But they get to the big league level while theyâ\\x80\\x99re throwing hard, and then they learn command. Home runs, more times than not, are mistakes  â\\x80\\x94   theyâ\\x80\\x99re not the wrong pitch, theyâ\\x80\\x99re just mistakes in the middle of the plate. â\\x80\\x9d Vogt, the Oakland catcher, said he had been calling more fastballs up in the zone lately, because umpires seem more willing to call them strikes. Missing with a high fastball can lead to home runs, of course, and so can a poorly placed cutter. If a cutter does not dart sharply at the last moment, it is just a slower fastball that stays in a hitterâ\\x80\\x99s bat path. â\\x80\\x9cThe cutter has become such a big pitch, and more guys are trying to throw it,â\\x80\\x9d Vogt said. â\\x80\\x9cBut a cutter that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t cut is a really good pitch to hit out. â\\x80\\x9d Vogt and other catchers, like San Franciscoâ\\x80\\x99s Buster Posey and Milwaukeeâ\\x80\\x99s Jonathan Lucroy, said they had noticed nothing different about the actual baseballs  â\\x80\\x94   which, of course, they handle just as often as pitchers, though not with the same intent. â\\x80\\x9cWe throw those things so much, weâ\\x80\\x99d be able to tell if thereâ\\x80\\x99s something different about them,â\\x80\\x9d Lucroy said. Lucroy pointed to recent changes at ballparks  â\\x80\\x94   like Petco Park, Citi Field and Marlins Park, where fences have all come in  â\\x80\\x94   as having an impact. But some pitchers, like Texasâ\\x80\\x99 Cole Hamels, have thrived at smaller venues because they have multiple weapons to keep hitters guessing. Younger pitchers are rarely as skilled. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not only having that second pitch, but having that third pitch,â\\x80\\x9d Hamels said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s easier for hitters to have success when itâ\\x80\\x99s    â\\x80\\x94   a lot better than a 25 percent chance. So when guys donâ\\x80\\x99t have four pitches they can essentially throw for strikes, that makes it a lot tougher. Guys are just homing in on certain counts and what guys have done statistically in the past, and theyâ\\x80\\x99re getting it. â\\x80\\x9d Daniel Murphy of the Nationals best embodies the trend around him. Murphy made the   team with the Mets in 2014, when he played a full season and hit nine homers. Now he has 17 to go with a . 348 average. Murphy emphasizes damage over contact, with startling results  â\\x80\\x94   and fastballs do not bother him. â\\x80\\x9cGuys throw so hard now, you either become accustomed to it or you have to find another line of work,â\\x80\\x9d Murphy said. â\\x80\\x9cThe more velocity you see, youâ\\x80\\x99re able to slow it down a little more. â\\x80\\x9d That last sentence might only make sense in the peculiar orbit of baseball, where fast can mean slow and a trend can quickly reverse itself.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON  â\\x80\\x94   As news outlets round the world continued to publish revelations from the Panama Papers, the nonprofit organization that coordinated the project was preparing to move out of its offices here in an effort to cut costs. The organization, called the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, was already forced to part with three contract journalists who had helped its small staff shepherd the project. And three other budgeted positions, it was told, would have to be left unfilled for now. Its brief shining moment in the journalistic spotlight was being complicated by much more familiar issues. Like so many of its peers in nonprofit journalism, the consortium is subject to the financial headwinds buffeting the industry as a whole. In this case, it is feeling ripple effects from the financial struggles of its parent organization, the Center for Public Integrity, the venerable nonprofit investigative news organization that controls the consortiumâ\\x80\\x99s budget. The financial pinch has created dual realities for the consortium, damping morale and escalating   tensions with its parent, even as the impact of the Panama Papers has dramatically increased its global profile. The consortiumâ\\x80\\x99s problems also represent a potential setback in the search for new ways to finance and pursue journalism at a time when traditional news organizations, and even new digital operations, are seeking workable business models. In the nonprofit segment of the industry, which has inspired hope as a way forward, it has exposed a particularly hard truth: Financing even the most successful investigative reporting unit is hard and often inconsistent. â\\x80\\x9cYou always want more staff and more funding,â\\x80\\x9d the consortiumâ\\x80\\x99s director, Gerard Ryle, said. â\\x80\\x9cBut I have to accept the situation as it is. My job is to get on with things no matter what. â\\x80\\x9d Financial uneasiness is nothing new for the Center for Public Integrity, which ran yearly operating deficits from 2005 to 2007, and again in 2011. Peter Bale, who took over the organization last year after a stint at CNN International, said the organization was still trying to recover from that legacy  â\\x80\\x94   including a $2. 1 million deficit in unrestricted net assets that he said he had inherited from his predecessor, whose editorial gambles have drawn criticism. That deficit, which the board has said cannot grow, has forced him to make cuts, Mr. Bale said, while honoring funding agreements and the centerâ\\x80\\x99s editorial imperatives. But Bill Buzenberg, who led the center from 2007 to 2015, disputed that assessment, saying that a deficit in general support is not unusual for nonprofits. It becomes a problem, he said, when annual   from specific programs and objectives declines. â\\x80\\x9cI kept telling them, you have to raise money like crazy this year for next,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Buzenberg said. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not sure that happened. â\\x80\\x9d The center is expected to raise $9. 3 million this year, down from around $11 million last year, Mr. Bale said, noting that grants to the center are often paid out over multiple years. He has had to consider cuts anywhere he can find them, not just at the consortium. The Center for Public Integrity laid off two prizewinning senior investigative reporters of its own in May and is delaying hiring for open positions. The financial woes have strained the relationship between two organizations that David E. Kaplan, who ran the consortium from 2008 to 2011, says have always been awkward partners. The consortium was founded in 1997 as a branch of the center to focus on international investigations, but it quickly developed its own ethos. â\\x80\\x9cThese are two different organizations in culture, structure and methodology,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Kaplan, who resigned in protest in 2011 during a period of particular tension between the groups. The differences have only intensified as the consortium has grown under Mr. Ryle, an   investigative journalist who worked in Australia before taking the position. Its budget has roughly tripled, to almost $2 million this year, and its staff has grown threefold, to about a dozen, including contractors, after the cuts. It has also deliberately moved away from the journalistic model of its parent organization, in search of a more effective way to investigate and distribute stories across borders at a relatively low cost. The model, in which the consortium coordinates teams of reporters around the world to work collaboratively on a single big source base, has been increasingly successful, aiding in investigations of international interest, like â\\x80\\x9cLux Leaks,â\\x80\\x9d which in 2014 exposed how Luxembourg had helped hundreds of international companies cut their taxes through preferential deals, and â\\x80\\x9cSwiss Leaks,â\\x80\\x9d which a year later exposed how HSBC helped the rich evade taxes. With the Panama Papers, the consortium assembled its largest team to date, carefully coordinating with almost 400 journalists from 70 countries to pore over a single enormous leak of documents. Using research tools developed by the consortium, the team exposed a vast network of offshore banks and shell companies used by the worldâ\\x80\\x99s powerful and rich to hide their wealth. Their findings have prompted investigations in dozens of countries, forced political ousters  â\\x80\\x94   including the prime minister of Iceland  â\\x80\\x94   and inspired policy debates around the world. The Panama Papers also brought a new level of renown to the consortium. And it prompted peers and supporters to wonder whether the organization could provide a model for a segment of the journalism industry particularly hard hit by shrinking budgets and other market forces. â\\x80\\x9cGiven the need to operate within the budgets we have, I. C. I. J. has done an astounding job,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Bale said of the consortium, adding that he hoped the Center for Public Integrity could incorporate some of its techniques. Mr. Bale acknowledged that tensions between the two groups had increased and might fan the desire by some at the consortium to spin off into a separate organization. That, he said, would be a mistake the centerâ\\x80\\x99s board opposes such a move.   could help, and both Mr. Bale and Mr. Ryle said they hoped the consortiumâ\\x80\\x99s increased profile would attract support to help stabilize the centerâ\\x80\\x99s overall finances. But for now, the cutbacks at the consortium are particularly painful. The group has spent much of the last two weeks moving up five floors from its own offices into the centerâ\\x80\\x99s. And though Mr. Ryle said he hoped to be able to hire back some of the contractors he had let go, for now, he said, he would have to make do with less. â\\x80\\x9cIt gives you an enormous amount of freedom in the journalism,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Ryle said of the nonprofit model, â\\x80\\x9cbut you have to accept that there is a cost sometimes on the other side. â\\x80\\x9d For Ryan Chittum, one of the three contractors who left last month after more than a year working on the Panama Papers, the timing is as frustrating as it is ironic. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s still a lot to do on that story  â\\x80\\x94   itâ\\x80\\x99s just kind of an unfortunate commentary on the fragility of journalism,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Chittum said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not like I make huge dollars, but we donâ\\x80\\x99t have money to do it right now. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       " 'Is This A New Escalation? BLACK Chemtrails Reported Around The World! Please scroll down for video \\nFor many years there have been theories floating around about the potential dangers of chemtrails, the white stripes with a cloudlike appearance that can often be seen in the skies. Some have suggested that these chemtrails are not as innocent as most people tend to think and some people have even gone so far as to say that they may be biological and chemical agents. \\nThis kind of theory has often been dismissed in the past as faulty reasoning and paranoid thinking. The phenomenon that believers identify as chemtrails are nothing more than the perfectly innocent condensation trials left behind by all kind of air vehicles. However, recent sightings of highly unusual chemtrails might well challenge this particular line of thinking. Black chemtrails in the sky stump sceptics \\nAccording to many witnesses from all across the world, the chemtrails or â\\x80\\x98condensation trialsâ\\x80\\x99 appearing in their local areas are not white anymore â\\x80\\x93 theyâ\\x80\\x99re black. No scientific body or government has chosen to offer an explanation about the sudden change in the appearance of numerous trails in the sky, but many believe that it is irrefutable evidence that chemtrails are being utilised for chemical or biological testing on civilian populations . \\nSceptics have suggested that these unusual black trails might be nothing more than a shadows of a typical white condensation trail left by a plane. However, this theory has been robustly dismissed by others who have pointed out that clouds leave no shadows in the sky and therefore it would be impossible for a condensation trail left by a plane to do the same thing. \\nNot all of the people who believe that chemtrails are a real phenomenon believe that they are used to covertly test chemical and biological weapons. Others have suggested that they are part of a weather modification technology, often referred to as HAARP. The chemtrails are being used to electrify portions of the sky so that they can be used for testing by scientists working in this field. \\nWhatever the truth of the matter is, one thing is for sure; these black chemtrails cannot be easily explained away. \\nThis article (Is This A New Escalation?

       " 'DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran confirmed on Sunday that an appeals court had upheld 10-year jail terms against a U.S. citizen, two Iranian-Americans and a U.S. resident from Lebanon who had been convicted on spying charges. In July, U.S. President Donald Trump warned that Iran would face  new and serious consequences  unless all  unjustly detained  American citizens were released and returned. Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi identified the four as Princeton University student Xiyue Wang, Iranian-American businessman Siamak Namazi and his elderly father Baquer and Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese citizen with permanent U.S. residency, the judiciary s official news website reported.  In Washington, Jared Genser, a lawyer for the Namazis, said in a statement carried by U.S. media last week that their family was informed that a Tehran court had upheld the convictions days earlier. Earlier in August, Princeton University and the wife of Wang, a history doctoral student and U.S. citizen, said they had been informed that Iranian authorities had denied the appeal. Wang was conducting dissertation research in Iran in 2016 when he was detained and charged with  spying under the cover of research , an accusation his family and university denied.  Iran sentenced Zakka, a Lebanese citizen with permanent U.S. residency, to 10 years in prison and a $4.2 million fine in 2016 after he was found guilty of collaborating against the state, according to his U.S.-based lawyer. Zakka, an information technology expert, had been invited to Iran by a government official a year earlier, but then disappeared after attending a conference in Tehran.  Iran s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers lifted most international sanctions and promised Iran s reintegration into the global community in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. The potential detente with the West has alarmed Iranian hardliners, who have seen a flood of European trade and investment delegations arrive in Tehran to discuss possible deals, according to Iran experts. Security officials have arrested dozens of artists, journalists and businessmen, including Iranians holding joint American, European or Canadian citizenship, as part of a crackdown on  Western infiltration . The arrests have undermined President Hassan Rouhani s goals of reviving business and political ties with the West, as well as pushing for more political and social reforms at home, Iran experts and observers said. A number of Iranian dual nationals from the United States, Britain, Austria, Canada and France have been detained in the past year and are being kept behind bars on charges including espionage and collaborating with hostile governments. According to former prisoners, families of current ones, and diplomats, in some cases the detainees are kept to be used for a prisoner exchange with Western countries.  In January 2016, the United States and Iran reached a historic prisoner swap deal that saw Iranians held or charged in the United States, mostly for sanctions violations, released in return for Americans imprisoned in Iran.

The latest, from CBS News, showed Clinton up just 2 points over Sanders, 49-47 percent.\\n\\nThe same poll gave Clinton a comfortable double-digit lead in New Jersey, which is voting Tuesday alongside California and four other states in the last major primary day of the year.\\n\\nThanks to strong victories for the Democratic front-runner over the weekend in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, she is now in striking distance of the nomination -- 26 delegates short of the 2,383 needed to win, according to an Associated Press count. New Jersey could put her over the top Tuesday evening, before California even wraps up.\\n\\nBut an after-the-fact victory for Sanders in the Golden State would nevertheless be a blow to Clinton, who is trying to not only clinch the nomination but unify the party and nudge Sanders out of the race for good. A California win could energize Sanders and his supporters and encourage him to follow through on vows to take his fight all the way to the convention.\\n\\nIn a sign of whatâ\\x80\\x99s at stake, both candidates were barnstorming California ahead of Tuesdayâ\\x80\\x99s elections.\\n\\nAs the Puerto Rico race was called, Clinton was on stage in Sacramento, rallying voters in California.\\n\\nClinton captured at least 33 of the 60 delegates at stake in Puerto Rico. Sanders garnered at least 20, with seven outstanding. Clinton has 1,809 pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses; Sanders has 1,520. When including superdelegates, her lead over Sanders is substantial -- 2,357 to 1,566.\\n\\nThe former New York senator and secretary of state is all but certain to secure the Democratic nomination Tuesday, when six states hold primaries in which a total of 694 delegates are available.\\n\\nLike Clinton, Sanders made little mention of the outcome in Puerto Rico\\'s primary. He said during an evening rally in San Diego that Democratic leaders should take notice that the \"energy and grassroots activism\" that will be crucial to the party in the fall \"is with us, not Hillary Clinton.\"\\n\\nHe pointed to polls showing him faring better than Clinton in head-to-head matchups with Trump and his strength among Democratic voters under the age of 45.\\n\\n\"If the Democratic leadership wants a campaign that will not only retain the White House but regain the Senate and win governors\\' chairs all across this country, we are that campaign,\" he said.\\n\\nWhile those watching the results in Puerto Rico focused on their impact on the race for the Democratic nomination, the focus of many voters on the island was its ongoing economic crisis.\\n\\nBoth Sanders and Clinton had pledged to help as the island\\'s government tries to restructure $70 billion worth of public debt the governor has said is unpayable.\\n\\nTwo weeks before the primary, Sanders criticized a rescue deal negotiated by U.S. House leaders and the Obama administration as having colonial overtones. In a letter to fellow Senate Democrats, Sanders said the House bill to create a federal control board and allow some restructuring of the territory\\'s $70 billion debt would make \"a terrible situation even worse.\"\\n\\nHe later promised to introduce his own legislation to help the island. Campaigning on the island last month, Sanders promised to fight against \"vulture funds\" on Wall Street that he said would profit off the fiscal crisis.\\n\\n\"That bill is anti-democratic and it\\'s not in the best interest of Puerto Rico,\" said Jorge Gaskins, a 67-year-old farmer who supports Sanders and opposes a control board.\\n\\nClinton has said she has serious concerns about the board\\'s powers, but believes the legislation should move forward, or \"too many Puerto Ricans will continue to suffer.\"\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'Rebecca Blumenstein, deputy editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, has been named a deputy managing editor of The New York Times, one of the top leadership positions at the newspaper. Ms. Blumenstein will become one of the   women in The Timesâ\\x80\\x99s newsroom. She will join three other deputy managing editors  â\\x80\\x94   Janet Elder Clifford Levy, who was promoted last week and Matthew Purdy. In a note to the staff announcing the appointment on Tuesday, Dean Baquet, the executive editor, and Joe Kahn, the managing editor, said that Ms. Blumenstein, 50, would help the newsroom â\\x80\\x9cdo all the big things we intend to do in 2017 and beyond. â\\x80\\x9d In particular, they said, Ms. Blumenstein â\\x80\\x9cwill focus on making sure we remain an essential destination for readers interested in business, finance, economics and technology. â\\x80\\x9d In recent months, the newsroom has had a dearth of female leaders. In September, Susan Chira stepped down as deputy executive editor to write about gender issues, and in December, Lydia Polgreen, an associate masthead editor, left to become the top editor at The Huffington Post. Ms. Blumensteinâ\\x80\\x99s appointment will quite likely be seen as a positive step, though it is notable that The Times named an outsider rather than promoting a woman from within. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Kahn said it was â\\x80\\x9cabsolutely not the caseâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 that they could not find a woman within The Times to play a role in newsroom leadership. â\\x80\\x9cThis is about Rebecca, who I think has a skill set, a perspective and the experience running a big newsroom that Dean and I and the others at the top of the masthead felt that we needed, to make sure that weâ\\x80\\x99re putting our best foot forward in terms of this digital transition,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kahn said. He added that there would be other masthead announcements soon. Ms. Blumenstein was seen as a potential successor to Gerard Baker, the editor in chief of The Journal, and news of her departure was met with surprise and sadness in the Journal newsroom, where she is known for her passion for breaking news. Asked how it felt to lure someone of Ms. Blumensteinâ\\x80\\x99s caliber from a highly respected competitor, Mr. Kahn was circumspect in his reply. â\\x80\\x9cI can only say that I follow and deeply admire The Journalâ\\x80\\x99s coverage, and theyâ\\x80\\x99re a fierce competitor and a constant source of concern for us,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kahn said. â\\x80\\x9cSo of course itâ\\x80\\x99s meaningful to have one of their top editors come and join us. â\\x80\\x9d In a note to employees, Mr. Baker called Ms. Blumenstein â\\x80\\x9ca peerless exponent and advocate of the very highest quality journalism. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cShe has been a singularly principled and dignified leader and a great mentor and friend to so many colleagues here,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote. The appointment comes as both news organizations work to determine a strategy for an increasingly digital world. Both have initiated sweeping newsroom strategy reviews that have left employees anxious and uncertain about their futures. Last month, The Times released the findings of its review in a report that called for rapid change. Ms. Blumenstein has worked at The Journal since 1995, where she has held numerous senior positions, including managing editor of WSJ. com and international editor. As the newspaperâ\\x80\\x99s China bureau chief, she led her team to a Pulitzer Prize in 2007. China was also where she and Mr. Kahn, who worked in the Beijing bureau for The Times, got to know each other, Mr. Kahn said. â\\x80\\x9cShe was unrelenting in pushing her team hard to beat us,â\\x80\\x9d he said.',\n",
       " 'BATON ROUGE, La.  â\\x80\\x94   He joined the Marines, served in Iraq and earned a Good Conduct Medal. He was an entrepreneur, a   author, a nutrition and fitness counselor, a proponent of the American gospel of  . He considered himself a lifestyle coach, even though he had failed in marriage, neglected to pay his taxes and was, at one point, living on $500 per month. He had also embarked on a spiritual quest to find his roots as a black man, traveling around Africa for two years. But Gavin Longâ\\x80\\x99s life also became a web of paranoid ideas, a professed allegiance to an antigovernment â\\x80\\x9csovereign citizenâ\\x80\\x9d group and a belief that bloodshed was a better tool than peaceful protest in the fight against oppression. On Sunday, Mr. Long died in a parking lot just off a commercial street here in a shootout with the police. It was his 29th birthday. He killed three law enforcement officers and wounded three others. On Monday, law enforcement officials said Mr. Long had targeted officers, though his motives otherwise remained murky. Mr. Long had been a resident of Kansas City, Mo. and it is unclear what he was doing in Baton Rouge, though a video that appears to have been posted by him shows him in the Louisiana capital discussing the July 5 fatal police shooting of a fellow   man, Alton B. Sterling, here. Though the police here have released little information about Mr. Long, a deeper portrait is beginning to emerge, based on a large trail left online. Many of these digital bread crumbs  â\\x80\\x94   web posts, YouTube videos and podcasts  â\\x80\\x94   are tied to Mr. Longâ\\x80\\x99s given name, or some version of a new name, Cosmo Ausar Setepenra, which he filed court documents in Missouri to adopt in May 2015. (He never petitioned the court, so the name change was not legally binding, officials said.) Some of these posts and videos included biographical and personal information that aligned with the information released by the authorities. In an interview with a podcast host in March, Mr. Long identified himself as a member of the online community of   targeted individuals, people who believe they are being harassed with   weapons and by armies of stalkers. And in one YouTube video, he discusses the killings of   men at the hands of police officers, including the death of Mr. Sterling, and advocates a bloody response instead of the protests that followed the deaths. â\\x80\\x9cOne hundred percent of revolutions, of victims fighting their oppressors,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Long said, â\\x80\\x9chave been successful through fighting back, through bloodshed. Zero have been successful just over simply protesting. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve got to stand on your rights, just like George Washington did, just like the other white rebels they celebrate and salute did,â\\x80\\x9d he added. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s what Nat Turner did. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what Malcolm did. â\\x80\\x9d In Baton Rouge on Monday, the crime scene along Airline Highway was returning to normal. Bullet holes could be seen in a wall of the Hair Crown Beauty Supply store, where the shooting took place. The city had begun the process of mourning the police officers Mr. Long gunned down  â\\x80\\x94   including Montrell Jackson, 32, an   and   veteran of the Baton Rouge Police Department, who left behind a wife and son. On a podcast posted on iTunes and dated April, the speaker, who gives his name as Cosmo, gives a sketch of his life story. He says he grew up in Kansas City, and was a   student until about middle school, when he became fat and started getting Câ\\x80\\x99s. As a child, he was something of a hustler who made extra money by making loans and charging interest. â\\x80\\x9cSay if I loaned out money to my family, even to my mother, I would make her pay me back, with interest,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cIf I loaned $20, I would make you pay me back $5 on Friday. â\\x80\\x9d He says he lost significant weight in high school, bought his first car at age 16 and joined the Marines. Mr. Longâ\\x80\\x99s military records show he served from 2005 to 2010, including a   deployment in Iraq. He was a sergeant and a data network specialist who earned several awards, including one for good conduct. He was also assigned to Okinawa, Japan, and several locations in Southern California. He attended Central Texas College at its Marine Corps Air Station Miramar site in San Diego and via distance education, earning an associate of arts degree. In 2011, court records show, he had an uncontested divorce from a woman named Aireyona Osha Hill. They listed that they had no children or assets and that Mr. Long earned $500 a month. Around this time, Mr. Long befriended a Kansas City schoolteacher who wished to remain anonymous because of the heinous nature of the shootings. The teacher said Mr. Long had taken interest in the Occupy Wall Street movement and   culture, and sympathized with the views of the villain Bane, from the 2012 Batman film â\\x80\\x9cThe Dark Knight Risesâ\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   particularly Baneâ\\x80\\x99s vigilantism against corruption. But the man the teacher knew never spoke about violent solutions to the real worldâ\\x80\\x99s problems. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m surprised he took it as far as he did,â\\x80\\x9d the teacher said Monday. â\\x80\\x9cIt doesnâ\\x80\\x99t surprise me so much as he had an agenda against the government. Heâ\\x80\\x99d always talk about how the government was corrupt. â\\x80\\x9d By 2012, Mr. Long had moved  â\\x80\\x94   briefly, apparently  â\\x80\\x94   to Tuscaloosa, Ala. where he spent one semester at the University of Alabama. He majored in business. He made the deanâ\\x80\\x99s list. The University of Alabama police had no interactions with him during his time there. Mike Mansur, a spokesman for the Jackson County prosecutorâ\\x80\\x99s office, which covers most of Kansas City, said his office also had no record of contact with Mr. Long. He also attended Clark Atlanta University during the   school year, and was in good academic standing, a university spokeswoman said. Although he claimed to be on the deanâ\\x80\\x99s list there, he said he had dropped out, sold his two cars, gave away his possessions and traveled to Africa. Mr. Long appeared to be obsessed with the idea of   for himself and for others, and he embraced more esoteric means of achieving those goals. While traveling to Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, he said, he wrote three books, covering topics like â\\x80\\x9cholistic detoxification for health,   and successâ\\x80\\x9d the â\\x80\\x9cancient esoteric secrets of the Pineal Glandâ\\x80\\x9d and the â\\x80\\x9c124 Universal Laws and their use in the Laws of the Cosmos. â\\x80\\x9d In 2015, Mr. Long filed the petition to change his name. In his statement of intent, he said he was a member of an â\\x80\\x9cindigenous societyâ\\x80\\x9d called the United Washitaw De Dugdahmoundyah Muâ\\x80\\x99ur nation. It was apparently a reference to the Empire Washitaw De Dugdahmoundyah. On its website, the group says it is â\\x80\\x9ca multicultural, highly spiritual nation of aboriginal, indigenous Americans. â\\x80\\x9d The group is largely   and subscribes to a â\\x80\\x9csovereign citizenâ\\x80\\x9d ideology holding that members are â\\x80\\x9cno longer beholden to any form of government,â\\x80\\x9d said Ryan Lenz, a senior writer for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups. On Monday morning, a man who answered a phone number on the website and said he was a leader of the group, Fredrix Joe Washington, said he had never heard of Mr. Long. â\\x80\\x9cWe are about peace  â\\x80\\x94   and especially not about going out and killing some police officers,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Washington, 71. This year, court records show, a case was filed against Mr. Long for not paying his local earnings tax. Papers in that case were served on his address last month, and his mother accepted them, according to court records. Six days later, the tax case was dismissed. In many of his podcasts, Mr. Long expounds at length on dating and   tips for men, arguing that they must display the characteristics of an â\\x80\\x9calphaâ\\x80\\x9d male. But a number of his other online offerings discuss the historical oppression of minorities, and Americaâ\\x80\\x99s current racial problems. In a recent email he sent out to those interested in his ideas, he listed numerous instances of massacres of   people. On July 8, Lance Scurvin, a podcast host in Orlando, Fla. posted a note from Mr. Long on his Facebook page that seemed to suggest that Mr. Long was feeling paranoid about his safety. Mr. Scurvin, who is known for lending a sympathetic ear to   guests, had interviewed Mr. Long in the past. â\\x80\\x9cI just want everyone to know that if anything may happen to me or with me, I am NOT affiliated with anybody, any group, nationality, association, religion, corporation, business, etc. â\\x80\\x9d the note said. Mr. Long traveled to Dallas after the killing of five police officers at a demonstration there on July 7. Chanattra Long, who is not related to Mr. Long, said he had come into her shop, the His and Hers Barber Shop, two days after that shooting and passed out copies of his book. â\\x80\\x9cHe pulled out a wad of money and said: â\\x80\\x98You think this is something? This is nothing,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d she recalled. She said he had spoken of being in Africa and of being able to speak five languages. She was startled at his boldness and assertiveness. She had never seen him before and had no idea why he entered her shop that day. â\\x80\\x9cI could tell he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t right, his demeanor, his aggressiveness,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Still, Mr. Long made no mention of attacking police, she said. One of Mr. Longâ\\x80\\x99s last videos, posted to YouTube but taken down as of Monday, shows him driving around Baton Rouge. He approaches a number of   strangers apparently, and doles out stray nuggets of advice and wisdom, deploying the salty language of the street. He refers to himself as a life coach, a freedom strategist, a real estate entrepreneur, an author, a teacher and a motivational speaker. And he tells them about his book. â\\x80\\x9cI want my people to succeed,â\\x80\\x9d he says at one point. Later, he refers to â\\x80\\x9cArabsâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cIndiansâ\\x80\\x9d who do not care about people, ostensibly   except when the latter give them their money. At one point he uses the word â\\x80\\x9ccracker,â\\x80\\x9d apparently in reference to whites. He also makes a passing reference to the shooting of Mr. Sterling. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s two parts to freedom, bruh,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cKnowing your rights and standing on your rights. They know we know our rights. â\\x80\\x9d But how many black people, he asked, stand on their rights? â\\x80\\x9cAnd if you not standing on your rights then you have no rights. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'While meeting with the press in the Oval Office on Wednesday, President Obama clearly had enough of Republican obstructionism and party politics holding the nation back from having a full Supreme Court. The GOP has made it clear that they won t even entertain the possibility of a new Justice until there s a new president. However, that s not going to prevent Obama from doing his job, and he really hopes these  sheepish  Republicans step up and do their job as well.Obama said: I m going to do my job. I recognize the politics are hard for them [Senate Republicans] because the easier thing to do is to give in to the most extreme voices within their party and stand pat and do nothing. But that s not our job. Our job is to fulfill our constitutional duties. Obama knows that once a nominee is chosen, and the American public sees this Republican obstructionism for all that it is, chances are, they won t be so quick to dismiss them. The president continued: I think it will be very difficult for Mr. McConnell to explain how, if the public concludes that this person is well qualified, that the Senate should stand in the way simply for political reasons. We ll see what happens and I think the situation may evolve over time. I don t expect Mitch McConnell to say that is the case today. President Obama then goes on to lay all the cards on the table and simply show the Republicans for what they are: unconstitutional fools. The GOP is trying so hard to prevent Obama that they are going against their supposed values of being  strict constitutionalists,  and Obama shows them as the hypocrites that they truly are.Obama said: It s not in the text of the Constitution. Ironically, these are Republicans who say they believe in reading the text of the Constitution and focusing on the intent of the Constitution. None of the Founding Fathers thought that, when it comes to the President carrying out his duties, he should do it for three years and on the last year stop doing it. Also saying that these Republicans  take a posture that defies the Constitution, defies logic, and is not supported by tradition. And really not holding back, the president states: There s not a lot of vigor when they defend the position they re taking when they defend their point. They re pretty sheepish about it when they make those comments. Which is exactly what they are. These Republicans are choosing party politics over what s best for the nation. They want to obstruct any choice the president makes while vilifying a hypothetical appointee before they even know who it s going to be. They aren t even hiding their blatant politicking anymore. To be honest, these Republicans should all find a new job if they don t want to do the one they ve been elected to do.Featured image: Pete Souza Instagram',\n",
       " 'More and more dirt on these two grifters who re shockingly still denying the truth or saying nothing to defend themselves. They have pocketed most of the donations with only 15 cents of every dollar donated going to charity. And now this  A charity affiliated with the Clinton Foundation failed to reveal the identities of its 1,100 donors, creating a broad exception to the foundation s promise to disclose funding sources as part of an ethics agreement with the Obama administration.The number of undisclosed contributors to the charity, the Canada-based Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, signals a larger zone of secrecy around foundation donors than was previously known.Details of the organization s fundraising were disclosed this week by a spokeswoman for the Canadian group s founder, mining magnate Frank Giustra.The Canadian group has received attention in recent days as a potential avenue for anonymous Clinton Foundation donations from foreign business executives, including some who had interests before the U.S. government while Hillary Rodham Clinton was secretary of state.The partnership, named in part for Bill Clinton, sends much of its money to the New York-based Clinton Foundation. Two of the partnership s known donors   Giustra and another mining executive, Ian Telfer   are featured in the soon-to-be-released book  Clinton Cash  for their roles in a series of deals that resulted in Russia controlling many uranium deposits around the world and in the United States.With the foundation s finances emerging as an issue for Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign, a foundation official this week defended the arrangement with the Giustra group, noting in a blog post that Canadian law prevents charities in that country from disclosing their donors without the donors  permission.The Canadian partnership has in recent days begun to reach out to its 28 largest donors, each of whom gave donations equivalent to at least $250,000 in U.S. dollars, to seek permission to release their names, said a person familiar with the foundation, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.The large number of undisclosed supporters of a Clinton-affiliated charity raises new questions about the foundation s adherence to the 2008 ethics agreement it struck with the Obama administration, which was designed to avoid conflicts of interest during Hillary Clinton s tenure at the State Department.Read more: WaPo',\n",
       " 'This story just keeps unraveling Two days ago, conservative Thomas Wictor dropped a bombshell on Twitter, exposing what he suggested was a forged Roy Moore signature on the yearbook that allegedly belongs to Beverly Young Nelson, the most recent sexual misconduct accuser of GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore.CNN published a story about Roy Moore signing Nelson s yearbook. Thomas Wictor dissected the signature and the validity of her story on Twitter:Beverly Young Nelson said Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore wrote a message in her yearbook in December 1977 that said, \"To a sweeter more beautiful girl, I could not say, \\'Merry Christmas.\\'\"She said he signed it, \"Roy Moore, D.A.\" https://t.co/aluJzQsv15 pic.twitter.com/esjGd1ssd9  CNN (@CNN) November 13, 2017Here are close up versions of the signatures. Note, that when viewed close up, the signature is signed in both black and blue ink.Here is a closer version of the yearbook signature:Here is Wictor s explanation for the different colors of ink:(4) The LIGHT is reflecting off of the ink.The ink that LOOKS blue is actually black. It\\'s DIFFERENT ink than the ORIGINAL ink.Therefore it reflects light differently.  Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 16, 2017(11) So, to recap:The signature is a forgery, and everything after the name \"Roy-Ray\" was added later with different ink. pic.twitter.com/1sPv6aABge  Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 15, 2017Just like the \"TH\" doomed Dan Rather, \"DA\" will doom the anti Roy Moore forces.

Well, uh, all I can say is we want it done in a professional setting to the extent possible, that s the only setting in which people can testify under oath,  Allred said.Blitzer asked if Allred s client would take a lie-detector test, but she refused, pushing for a Senate hearing.Go to the 25:30 min. mark in the video:',\n",
       " 'Panama City, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump is tearing the Grand Old Party apart.\\n\\nThe tension that has simmered in the Republican Party for years -- shutting down the government and nearly bringing the nation to default -- escalated into an outright civil war Tuesday. The conflict not only threatens the party\\'s ability to make any realistic attempt at reclaiming the White House next month, but also previews the conflicts and divides that could consume the GOP for years to come if Trump loses.\\n\\nOn one side is Trump, who spent much of Tuesday lashing out on social media at his GOP foes, such as Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. John McCain, and lamenting the lack of party unity. He\\'s backed by conservative lawmakers including Iowa Rep. Steve King and the throngs of loyal supporters who attend his rallies, including the one here in Panama City, Florida, Tuesday, where he renewed his call for a government investigation into his opponent, Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nSome are even raising the potential of denying Ryan the speakership after the election.\\n\\nOn the other side is Ryan, who is devoting the full resources of his stature to maintaining a congressional majority. That dominance of Capitol Hill is suddenly threatened -- and not just in the Senate, where there are many competitive races, but also in the House, where the GOP majority was considered untouchable until recently.\\n\\nThe infighting -- sparked by the release Friday of a 2005 video depicting Trump describing women in vulgar and sexually aggressive terms -- isn\\'t likely to ease in the 27 days before Election Day. Trump made clear Tuesday that if he loses in November, he won\\'t go down quietly -- or alone.\\n\\nHe began the day with a series of shots -- taken over Twitter -- at Ryan, saying it\\'s hard to do well when the speaker isn\\'t supportive. He followed up about an hour later calling Ryan a \"weak and ineffective leader.\"\\n\\nAnd nearly two hours after that, Trump posed his most explosive tweet of the day.\\n\\n\\'Shackles have been taken off me\\'\\n\\nTrump continued his attacks on Ryan Wednesday during a rally in central Florida, where he said he\\'s at a disadvantage when \"you have leadership not putting their weight behind the people.\"\\n\\nHe also complained about getting no credit from party leaders for his Sunday night debate performance.\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you think Paul Ryan would call and say good job?\" he said. \"It got just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country. You\\'d think they\\'d say great going, Don, let\\'s beat this crook. No, he doesn\\'t.\"\\n\\nTrump\\'s turn on his own party may seem counterproductive -- it hardly allows him to improve his chances of catching Clinton. But it does allow him the satisfaction of vengeance against party leaders he believes have never treated him fairly since his stunning outsider campaign captured the nomination earlier this year.\\n\\nAnd by blaming Republican leaders for their failure to wholeheartedly endorse his campaign, Trump also opens up the possibility of a face-saving excuse if he crashes to defeat in November.\\n\\nBut the cost to the Republican Party of Trump\\'s burn-it-down-around-him strategy is already high, could become more extreme and potentially leave the GOP badly damaged long after he has left the political scene.\\n\\nTo begin with, the estrangement between Trump and the party leaders is blowing open a gaping split between the party\\'s grass roots and its establishment leaders that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and others worked so hard to bridge over the summer.\\n\\nIt is a divide that will be hard to overcome if Trump loses the election. Forging unity could be impossible if hordes of Trump voters blame party leaders for the defeat of a man who electrified the grass roots supporters in a way no other Republican has managed in decades.\\n\\nKing, the Iowa Republican congressman, warned Tuesday that a purge of party elites might be necessary, saying \"the establishment wing of the party could simply be amputated out in this effort that\\'s going on right now.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'ve gone so far out on this limb,\" King said on the Laura Ingraham radio show.\\n\\nThe meltdown in the GOP is the culmination of forces that have been building for years. Intense antipathy towards congressional leaders over their failure to more forcefully oppose President Barack Obama gave rise to the Tea Party and sent waves of anti-establishment lawmakers to Washington in successive elections.\\n\\nTrump\\'s adoption of a factually-challenged style of campaigning would have been impossible without the power of conservative media that has been building for decades and is now fused with the GOP presidential ticket through the role of Stephen Bannon, the head of Breitbart News, who serves as the CEO of the Trump campaign.\\n\\nTrump\\'s turn against his own party could also reverberate in down-ballot races. Republicans have long known that their hold on the Senate was tenuous -- whoever ran at the top of their ticket -- but Trump\\'s slumping poll numbers now threaten to drag down vulnerable incumbents too.\\n\\nAt the very least, a Trump implosion that cuts deeply into Ryan\\'s majority could complicate the Speaker\\'s already tough task of corralling his volatile majority coalition. If an anti-Trump landslide sweeps away House GOP members in more moderate districts, it could hand more relative power to the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and give him the same kinds of fits that it imposed on John Boehner, his predecessor.\\n\\nThe dilemma is especially difficult for Republican senators running for re-election. Some are rejecting Trump because of revulsion at his remarks among more moderate voters. But at the same time, they risk alienating Trump supporters in states\\'s where the former reality star racked up high margins in the primary race.\\n\\nNew Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte fits into this category and her desperate effort to walk the fine line between condemning and embracing Trump during this election has become a symbol of the wider GOP conundrum. Ayotte finally said she could not vote for Trump after the video emerged on Friday.\\n\\nBut another star of the GOP, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, said Tuesday he\\'s not yet ready to back away from Trump. Rubio looks certain to need Trump voters to maintain his narrow lead in his re-election race. But at the same time, if more explosive video emerges about Trump, Rubio, who has presidential ambitions in his future, risks being tarnished by association with the Republican nominee.\\n\\nAnother lawmaker in a tough re-election race who is hedging his bets is North Carolina GOP Sen. Richard Burr, who said that while Trump\\'s comments were \"indefensible,\" he still plans to support him.\\n\\nFor her part, the turmoil consuming the GOP would seem to provide a substantial boost to Clinton\\'s White House bid. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday found the Democratic nominee enjoying a 9-point lead among likely voters in a four-way race.\\n\\nBut her aides caution against excessive optimism. There\\'s concern inside the campaign that an increasingly negative race -- which could only become darker in the days ahead -- could turn off voters and make them less likely to show up at the polls. In that instance, a lower turnout could create an advantage for Trump.\\n\\n\"This seems to be their strategy, disgust everyone with our democratic dialogue so that they won\\'t come out to the polls,\" John Podesta, Clinton\\'s campaign chairman, told reporters Tuesday. \"I think it is very unbecoming a presidential candidate.\"\\n\\nClinton said as much herself during an interview with a Florida radio station Tuesday.\\n\\n\"Despite all of the terrible things (Trump) has said and done, he is still trying to win this election,\" she said. \"And we cannot be complacent, we cannot rest.\"',\n",
       " 'Ever wonder how Britainâ\\x80\\x99s most iconic pop pianist gets through a long flight? Here are the six pictures of sharks Sir Elton John likes to stare at to pass the time on an airplane. 1. A Shark Swimming \\nSit next to Elton John on a flight and youâ\\x80\\x99ll see a man living in the lap of luxury, as he immediately tapes this photo of a shark darting through the ocean over his window to stare at throughout the trip. The platinum-selling artist has been known to pull his window shade down to make the shark disappear, and then quickly retract it to mark the animalâ\\x80\\x99s triumphant return. He will often repeat this act dozens of times per flight. 2. A Great White Shark Leaping Into The Air \\nWhen youâ\\x80\\x99re an international pop sensation worth an estimated $450 million, people go the extra mile to make you happy. Flight crews are instructed to place this photo of a breaching great white in Elton Johnâ\\x80\\x99s seat-back pocket before he even boards the plane. The five-time Grammy winner loves to pull the image out at his leisure to stare at while flying, sometimes holding it a mere 3-to-4 inches away from his face while he fixates upon the sharkâ\\x80\\x99s beady eyes. 3. A Shark On The Prowl \\nRumor has it Elton John first acquired this shark photo in 1997, just before flying to London to perform â\\x80\\x9cCandle In The Windâ\\x80\\x9d at Princess Dianaâ\\x80\\x99s funeral. Itâ\\x80\\x99s been a staple of his travel routine ever since. Those who have flown with the music legend say that Sir Elton turns on every single overhead light in his row to study this picture with a magnifying glass. 4. Two Hammerhead Sharks \\nHow does the man behind â\\x80\\x9cTiny Dancerâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cRocket Manâ\\x80\\x9d handle turbulence as his plane traverses the Atlantic? Once that â\\x80\\x9cFasten Seat Beltsâ\\x80\\x9d sign lights up, this picture of two hammerhead sharks comes out. Elton John holds the photo in a tight vice grip and stares straight at it until the turbulence passes, often without blinking for minutes at a time. 5. The Poster For Jaws \\nSir Elton John absolutely adores the poster for Steven Spielbergâ\\x80\\x99s Jaws and hopes to one day see the film. In the meantime, the British icon makes do by slowly unfolding his 24-by-36-inch copy of the poster whenever heâ\\x80\\x99s on a long flight, gently tracing the sharkâ\\x80\\x99s teeth with his finger as he stares lovingly into its gaping mouth. 6. Pilotâ\\x80\\x99s Choice \\nAs much as Elton relishes in the calming regularity of his shark picture rotation, he also loves the excitement of gazing upon a totally unexpected shark when flying from London to a distant corner of Europe. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why all pilots who fly Sir Elton print out a shark picture of their choice from their home computers before going to the airport, and hand it to the visibly excited musician prior to takeoff. So yeahâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s good to be Elton!',\n",

Edlinger is preferring an evil record as a public official, to no record as a public official. Edlinger fails to make two crucial distinctions: One is that he fails to distinguish between mere political statements, versus actual political policies carried out as a public official (which show Hillary to be a proven neocon and tool of Wall Street); and the other is his failing to distinguish between a bad record in a personâ\\x80\\x99s private or business affairs, versus a bad record as an actual public official. Only the bad record as a public official should be absolutely disqualifying â\\x80\\x94 and thatâ\\x80\\x99s Clinton, not Trump, who has a horrific record as a public official.

Proven selfishness in oneâ\\x80\\x99s private life is bad, but proven selfishness and evil in oneâ\\x80\\x99s public-office policies (such as â\\x80\\x9cWe came, we saw, he died. Ha, ha!â\\x80\\x9d ) is utterly disqualifying. I argued in my â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m a Bernie Sanders Voter: Hereâ\\x80\\x99s Why Iâ\\x80\\x99ll Vote Trumpâ\\x80\\x9d , that Trump could possibly turn out to be a progressive President; but, even if he turns out to be a bad President, he wonâ\\x80\\x99t, on balance, be as horrific as will a President Hillary Clinton. With Trump, there is reason to have some hope for the future of the world; with Clinton, there is reason to expect unprecedented horrors .

       " 'Former President Barack Obama seems to be feeling nostalgic for his old job, meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in Monday for 40 minutes.The Korea Herald reported that Moon spoke about his recent meetings with President Trump in Washington and asked Obama for his advice on how to improve that relationship.The meeting came after Obama spoke at the Asian Leadership Conference and the Fourth Congress of Indonesian Diaspora in Jakarta. There he attacked Trump s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change accord. In Paris, we came together around the most ambitious agreement in history about climate change, an agreement that even with the temporary absence of American leadership can still give our children a fighting chance,  Obama said in Indonesia.The former president had said before leaving office that he appreciated his predecessor George W. Bush s silence during his tenure, but also contended that he s  still a citizen and that carries with it duties and obligations.    Daily Caller',\n",

That s a lot of lying.Apparently, Donald Trump is such a serial liar with a terrible memory that his own attorneys admitted that they always had to meet with him in pairs.According to a deposition released by Buzzfeed, bankruptcy attorney Patrick McGahn testified during the Trump Plaza bankruptcy case that his client lied so much that the firm made it a policy that a second attorney, identified as George Miller, had to be present as a corroborating witness. It s always been our practice to make sure that two people are present, and we don t have a problem of people lying He s an expert at interpreting things. Let s put it that way,  McGahn said,When asked if it was necessary for both of them to meet with Trump, McGahn said that it was. We tried to do it with Donald always if we could because Donald says certain things and then has a lack of memory.

Said under oath: Was destroying them whole time.â\\x80\\x9d Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nNewsweekâ\\x80\\x99 s Kurt Eichenwald has struck again, reporting that Donald Trump â\\x80\\x9crefused 2 produce records sought by prosecutors for 6 months. Said under oath: Was destroying them whole time.â\\x80\\x9d \\nThe whole strategy, he writes at Newsweek in an article he swears was written before Comeyâ\\x80\\x99s announcement, was â\\x80\\x9cdeny, impede and delay, while destroying documents the court had ordered them to hand over.â\\x80\\x9d \\nIn 1973, he reveals, â\\x80\\x9cthe Republican nominee, his father and their real estate company battled the federal government over civil charges that they refused to rent apartments to African-Americans.â\\x80\\x9d \\nShortly after the government filed its case in October, Trump attacked: He falsely declared to reporters that the feds had no evidence he and his father discriminated against minorities, but instead were attempting to force them to lease to welfare recipients who couldnâ\\x80\\x99t pay their rent.The familyâ\\x80\\x99s attempts to slow down the federal case were at times nonsensical. Trump submitted an affidavit contending that the government had engaged in some unspecified wrongdoing by releasing statements to the press on the day it brought the case without first having any â\\x80\\x9cformal communicationsâ\\x80\\x9d with him; he contended that heâ\\x80\\x99d learned of the complaint only while listening to his car radio that morning. But Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s sworn statement was a lie. Court records show that the government had filed its complaint at 10 a.m. and phoned him almost immediately afterward. The government later notified the media with a press release. [â\\x80¦] Six months after the original filing, the case was nowhere because the Trumps had repeatedly ignored the deadlines to produce records and answers to questions, known as interrogatoriesâ\\x80¦.Finally, under subpoena, Trump appeared for a short deposition. When asked about the missing documents, he made a shocking admission: The Trumps had been destroying their corporate records for the previous six months and had no document-retention program. They had conducted no inspections to determine which files might have been sought in the discovery requests or might otherwise be related to the case. Instead, in order to â\\x80\\x9csave space,â\\x80\\x9d Trump testified, officials with his company had been tossing documents into the shredder and garbage. \\nSo Trump can accuse Hillary Clinton of destroying emails â\\x80\\x93 and he does, nearly every day â\\x80\\x93 but only as a means of covering up and deflecting his own misdeeds in that regard. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith false affidavits and â\\x80\\x98deny and delayâ\\x80\\x9d strategies,â\\x80\\x9d writes Eichenwald, â\\x80\\x9cTrump & his cos hid and destroyed records sought in court.â\\x80\\x9d \\nDonald Trump is a world class liar and a man known for his deflection tactics, projecting his own guilt onto others. His Foundation in trouble? Point the finger at the Clinton Foundation. Sexual assault allegations? Point the finger at Bill and Hillary Clinton. \\nOnce again, Kurt Eichenwald has dug into Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s deplorable past and revealed the real Donald Trump. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not pretty. And each revelation from Eichenwald and David Fahrenthold shows Trump to be an even worse human being than the last. \\nIt is no wonder his deplorables love him so much. \\nIt Turns Out Trump Put off Investigators for 6 Months While He Destroyed Emails added by Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Justice Department official who oversaw efforts to prosecute Islamic State sympathizers and pursue cyber criminals is leaving the Obama administration next month, he told Reuters on Tuesday. Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, chief of the national security division at the Justice Department, is departing on Oct. 15, less than a month before the U.S. presidential election.     The departure comes as the Obama administration has struggled to develop clear guidelines on how to pursue hacking amid growing threats posed by foreign nation-states and criminal groups. In an interview, Carlin, 43, declined to say where he was headed next. He intends to spend time with his family before starting a new job, likely involved in cyber security, he said. Carlin, who has served in government for more than 15 years, oversaw a range of prominent cases in three and a half years since assuming an acting rank of the Justice Departmentâ\\x80\\x99s top national security lawyer in March 2013, including the prosecution of one of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombers.  He was confirmed full-time to the position in a 99-1 vote by the U.S. Senate in April 2014.  Carlin focused on pursuing cyber criminals during his tenure running the national security division.  His tenure included the unprecedented indictment of five Chinese military hackers in 2014 for alleged hacking into six U.S. companies in order to steal trade secrets, and the indictment of Iranian hackers earlier this year for alleged hacks on U.S. financial institutions and a New York dam. In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Carlin was a â\\x80\\x9ctrusted and tireless leaderâ\\x80\\x9d who â\\x80\\x9cused all the tools at his disposal to enhance our public safety and uphold our national security.â\\x80\\x9d Carlin will be replaced by Mary McCord, principal deputy assistant attorney general, on an acting basis, the Justice Department said. Through a combination of legal cases, diplomatic sanctions and an effort to publicly name and shame hacking adversaries, Carlin sought to tame what he often called the wild west of cyberspace, where international norms for appropriate cyber activity are nascent or nonexistent. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve laid a strong foundation in cyber, but weâ\\x80\\x99ve got to do more, faster, given the state of the threat,â\\x80\\x9d Carlin told Reuters. He said he hoped the next presidential administration could further â\\x80\\x9cinstitutionalizeâ\\x80\\x9d consequences from cyber crime. Most recently Carlin announced this month the formation of a threat analysis team to study potential national security challenges posed by self-driving cars, medical devices and other Internet-connected tools. Carlinâ\\x80\\x99s appointment in early 2014 coincided with territorial gains by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria that propelled the militant group to global notoriety. Since then, the department has prosecuted dozens of people on counts related to Islamic State: more than 100 people have been charged since 2014 in public federal cases.  Under Carlin, the national security division has also ramped up the Justice Departmentâ\\x80\\x99s efforts to combat what it sees as a rising threat from domestic anti-government extremists. ',\n",

       " \"Donald Trump has once again decided to lie to his supporters and accuse a major news network of editing his words to explain away his abortion views.Last week, Trump took five different stances on abortion. First, he said women who have them should be punished. Then he said it should be left up to the states. After that, he changed his mind again and  clarified  his original statement by saying doctors who perform abortions should be punished. His fourth position came when he gave an interview for CBS s Face The Nation and claimed that he wouldn t do anything to change abortion laws because the Supreme Court has already decided on their legality with Roe v Wade.When the media said, Wait a second Trump just took a pro-choice stance on abortion by declaring it should remain legal,  his campaign put out a statement saying he would, in fact, try to outlaw it with judicial appointments   taking his fifth abortion position of the week.Well, on Saturday while speaking at a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, the Republican frontrunner implied that CBS edited words out of his statement in an attempt to smear him. According to CNN: They can take something you say and turn it around. Like I will be on CBS s  Face the Nation.  What I said was perfect,  Trump explained, adding,  What I said was so good. It was so perfect. And they looked and said,  Oh, maybe he should have added a word.' Well, actually the way it came out, they took words out that I said,  he added.  The only reason I tell you this is because I want you to watch it. If I did something wrong, I wouldn t want you to watch it. Clearly, his words were not as  perfect  as he thought since he now feels the need to explain them away by lying to his supporters. He went on to say that the media often edits his words: The problem is they don t do it with everybody. They do it with me. But I don t see them doing it with other people. Wow! It s pretty convenient that the media only edits him, don t you think?CNN apparently reached out to CBS for comment and a spokeswoman said, nothing in that section he reference was edited.  That s exactly the same response that MSNBC had last week when Trump accused them of the very same thing.It is amazing that this guy can literally lie all the time and his supporters don t care at all. It s even funnier when these same supporters turn around and call President Obama a liar. It s almost as if they live in an alternate reality, isn t it?Featured image via Ian MacNicol/Getty Images\",\n",
       " 'You have to admire conservatives  ability to commit to the lie. After David Daledin and Sandra Merritt, the slimy, lying taint-barnacles who produced the fraudulent, heavily-edited Planned Parenthood  baby parts  videos that took the conservative world by storm, were indicted on multiple felony charges  a surprising event that took place during the course of an investigation into Planned Parenthood of the Gulf Coast ordered by Texas Governor Greg Abbott   one would expect conservatives to turn their anger toward those who lied to them. Unfortunately, these are people who still think Hillary Clinton was responsible for Benghazi.The indictments against the perpetrators of these agregious lies, ones that inspired Robert Dear to engage in an act of terrorism against a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado, were enough to throw 2016 hopeful Carly Fiorina into a fit of delusional panic and rage.On Monday, Fiorina joined conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt to share her outrage   not against the people whose lies caused her to spout off crazy talk about  baby parts  for months, but against anyone remotely interested in the truth. Asked for her reaction, Fiorina explained that she is furious that Planned Parenthood s  trafficking in baby body parts  did not lead to prosecution: Yes, well, this is why it s a fight for the character of our nation. We know for a fact that because of Planned Parenthood s own announcement that they would no longer accept payments for what they call  fetal tissue,  and they were in fact trafficking in baby body parts. So guess what? I m not going to sit down and be quiet as I said at the March for Life in Washington, D.C. on Friday before the snowstorm descended. I will not sit down and be quiet, I know the value of life, we know what s going on, and I will continue to stand for the character of this nation. From what I read, somehow the charge is that they falsified government identities because that s true obviously, that s not good, but I only know what I read at this point, but I think it s pretty clear that we now know what goes on in Planned Parenthood clinics,  Fiorina told Hewitt, explaining that the indictments for  Tampering with a Governmental Record  and  Prohibition of the Purchase and Sale of Human Organs   very serious charges   were an outrage because despite all this, she considers the heavily-edited videos to be legitimate: Here s what I know: Planned Parenthood has been trafficking in body parts. Planned Parenthood has been altering late-term abortion techniques to this specific purpose of harvesting body parts. In President Fiorina budget, there will not be a single dime for Planned Parenthood. Fiorina isn t the only GOP candidate who is immune to reality. Marco Rubio told CNN that he is  disturbed  because Planned Parenthood,  who are the ones that were actually selling off these (body) parts were found having done nothing wrong, the people who tried to expose them are the ones that are now facing criminal charges. It s interesting what happens when people focus on the facts, isn t it?Mike Huckabee called Monday a  sick day in America  because  those who expose evil w/ a cellphone  are being punished for their criminal actions, but Planned Parenthood was found to have done nothing criminal. Ben Carson s campaign promised retribution against Planned Parenthood, which has been cleared in every single politically-motivated investigation against them to date. Carson s Communication Director told CNN: He is equally shocked that they instead decided to indict the individuals that exposed Planned Parenthood s heinous and illegal activities. As President, he will use the full weight of his office to not only cut off all federal funding for this organization, but also prosecute them for crimes against the unborn. Unfortunately, conservatives simply don t care about the truth   and the truth is that the only criminals are the ones who made the fake videos that prompted the Stupid Part of America to lose their sh*t.Listen to Carly Fiorina lose her mind below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbuAU-9QX8A?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via YouTube',\n",
       " 'RIYADH (Reuters) - The failed North Korean missile test over the weekend was an attempt by the reclusive country to â\\x80\\x9cprovoke something,â\\x80\\x9d U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday, pledging that the  United States will work with China to reduce tensions.  U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a hard line with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who has rebuffed admonitions from China and proceeded with nuclear and missile programmes seen by Washington and others as a direct threat. On Saturday North Korea carried out a missile launch which the Pentagon said failed, blowing up almost immediately . Speaking with reporters on his way to the Middle East, Mattis said the most recent test was not an intercontinental ballistic missile but still a reckless move. â\\x80\\x9cIt shows why we are working so closely right now with the Chinese... to try to get this under control and aim for the denuclearized Korean peninsula,â\\x80\\x9d Mattis said. Trump acknowledged on Sunday that the softer line he had taken on Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s management of its currency was linked to its help on North Korea. The United States, its allies and China are working on a range of responses to North Koreaâ\\x80\\x99s missile test, U.S. officials have said. China itself has spoken out against the Northâ\\x80\\x99s weapons tests and has supported U.N. sanctions.  It banned imports of North Korean coal on Feb. 26, cutting off its most important export and Chinese media has raised the possibility of restricting oil shipments to North Korea if it unleashed more provocations. On Monday U.S. Vice President Mike Pence put North Korea on notice, warning that recent U.S. strikes in Syria and Afghanistan showed that the Trump administrationâ\\x80\\x99s resolve should not be tested. The Trump administration is focusing its strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including an oil embargo, a global ban on its airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang. The North has warned of a nuclear strike against the United States if provoked. It has said it has developed and would launch a missile that can strike the mainland United States but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology, including miniaturizing a nuclear warhead.

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s announcement on Wednesday on banning transgender people from serving in the U.S. military unleashed a storm of legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to file suit. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s surprise tweets did not make clear when a ban reversing former President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s policy would go into effect, nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join. But if the U.S. Defense Department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military, the Pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight,  legal experts say. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military,â\\x80\\x9d said Jon Davidson, legal director for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal. â\\x80\\x9cThey are currently serving without a problem. There hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been an extraordinary cost. There hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been disruption.â\\x80\\x9d Experts say singling out transgender people would violate their rights to equal protection under the law as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Joshua Block at the American Civil Liberties Union said his inbox was flooded with emails about Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s ban, including from service members. â\\x80\\x9cI think the most important thing for people to understand is that for the immediate future, nothing can happen to them ... Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s tweet is not self-executing,â\\x80\\x9d said Block, a senior staff attorney on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues. Under Obama, the Defense Department declared in June 20016 that transgender people could serve openly in the armed forces. The Pentagon was considering a second step of allowing openly transgender people to enlist when Trump on Wednesday issued three tweets saying transgender people would not be allowed to serve any capacity in the military, citing disruptions and medical costs. The Pentagon referred all questions to the White House, where press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump made the decision in consultation with his national security team and that the Defense Department would work with the White House and take the lead on a lawful implementation.  Sarah Warbelow, the Human Rights Campaignâ\\x80\\x99s legal director, said Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s declaration amounted to â\\x80\\x9cdiscrimination on the basis of sex and identity,â\\x80\\x9d and was therefore open to legal challenge. â\\x80\\x9cThe courts do provide quite a bit of deference to the military in determining its own policies,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cHowever, that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean the military is above the law.â\\x80\\x9d But the Pentagon may have a clearer path to a ban should it merely prevent new transgender recruits from signing up. If the ban applies only to those seeking to enlist, the legal bar would be higher because the military already has wide leeway to exclude classes of people based on medical needs, Block said. If Trump did want to remove all existing transgender servicemembers from the ranks, it was unclear what legal mechanism he could use to forcibly discharge U.S. troops. If transgender people disclosed their identity as a result of the Obama policy and that policy is then changed, they would have a legal recourse should they be arbitrarily denied their jobs and benefits, Davidson said. Even those seeking to enlist might allege the government banned transgender individuals in an arbitrary way and without good reason. But at least one legal expert said a challenge would be difficult to mount because courts typically defer to the government on military matters. Eugene Fidell, who teaches military law at Yale Law School, said even if discharged transgender service members asked for military reviews of their cases and won, those decisions could be overturned by the secretaries of the four branches of the military, who are political appointees. It would difficult to convince federal courts to reverse the secretaries, Fidell said. ',\n",

He was three doors down from his house when a car pulled up by him. Two Hispanic men in the vehicle asked Jas which gang he belonged to. Police reports indicate Jas did not respond, which frustrated one of the men who pulled out a gun and shot the teen.Jamiel, inside the family home, heard the shots and ran outside to find his son, a boy he judged to have been on the  right path,  bleeding from bullet wounds. Jas later died at the hospital.In the days that followed that incident, Shaw tried to piece together the perfect storm of conditions that created this tragedy. Shaw learned the man who had killed his son was an illegal immigrant who had just been released from jail.The incident gained national attention for a short time, prompting former president George W. Bush to write a condolence letter. But it was quickly forgotten, and Shaw didn t quite know what to do. Since my son was dead, I pretty much gave up on being happy,  Shaw said. He said he gave in to grieving day in and day out. Shaw also admitted a frustration of not being able to express the sorrow he had to others.Trump unexpectedly reached out to Shaw last year about the murder and asked for a meeting at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles hotel, which left Shaw stunned. To see somebody, especially a billionaire, come out. I can t even get a neighborhood politician to come out, that s why it s so surreal to me,  Shaw said.The two shared an intimate moment shortly after meeting last year.  He told me to my face, he said,  I promise you I would never let your son s life be in vain.  To me it felt like the [future] president cared about me,  an emotional Shaw shared.Shaw told the Washington Examiner that he never reached out to the Trump campaign about immigration policy, and especially the deportation of violent criminals of the kind who killed his son. He believes someone on Trump s team saw an interview he did on Fox News.Trump s meeting with Shaw and promise to reform immigration laws were a transformative moment for Shaw, who was previously a Democrat but had switched to Independent following the death of his son.

       " 'KABUL, Afghanistan  â\\x80\\x94   A   Afghan police chief with deep experience in Afghanistanâ\\x80\\x99s long conflict with the Taliban was killed in a blast on Sunday in the countryâ\\x80\\x99s eastern Nangarhar Province, which has been under threat from the Taliban and affiliates of the Islamic State. The police chief, Gen. Zarawar Zahid, was visiting an outpost in the Hisarak district when explosives placed near the outpost detonated, according to Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar. One of General Zahidâ\\x80\\x99s bodyguards was wounded, Mr. Khogyani said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the killing, according to a statement by the insurgencyâ\\x80\\x99s spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid. The attack came a week after twin bombings outside Afghanistanâ\\x80\\x99s Ministry of Defense killed at least 40 people, including several senior security officials. Nangarhar, which borders Pakistan, has faced mounting security perils over the past couple of years, with new Islamic State affiliates complicating the threat from the Taliban. Zabihullah Zmarai, a member of the provincial council, said the Islamic State posed a danger in five districts, despite repeated operations by the Afghan Army. â\\x80\\x9cOut of the 22 districts, only six are secure,â\\x80\\x9d he said. The Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s presence across nearly a dozen districts varies, Mr. Zmarai said. But the Hisarak district faced a collapse in recent weeks. That drew the attention of General Zahid, who had gone there to supervise a counterattack. Over the past decade, he rose from a bodyguard to a   police chief of several volatile provinces. His postings included two stints as the police chief of southeastern Ghazni Province, and one term each in Zabul and Paktika Provinces. General Zahid was seen as a   commander, often arriving at the front lines unannounced. When a major cultural event drew world leaders to the ancient city of Ghazni, the general was photographed riding around the city on the back of a motorcycle to check on security measures. He had been wounded twice and had lost two brothers during the decades of war in Afghanistan. In June, he took part in clashes with Pakistani forces that erupted on the border. In a Facebook video that he posted, he appeared beside two mortars and shouted to his men, â\\x80\\x9cStrike hard enough to blow up Nawaz Sharifâ\\x80\\x99s home,â\\x80\\x9d referring to the prime minister of Pakistan. Sediq Sediqqi, the spokesman for Afghanistanâ\\x80\\x99s Ministry of Interior Affairs, called General Zahid â\\x80\\x9cone of the bravest commanders of Afghan police. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHe lost his life on the front line of duty in the fight against terrorism,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sediqqi said.',\n",

       " 'Not long ago, the hacker collective known as Anonymous declared war against Michigan s Republican governor Rick Snyder in a new campaign called #OpFlint. The declaration came, as they always do, in the form of a slick YouTube video, where they called for Snyder s arrest. Less than 24 hours after Anonymous released the video, a major cyber-attack has been confirmed in Flint.Anonymous did not make any specific details on what action(s) they will take in order to help the people of Flint. They say in the video, that  We must remind the city officials of Flint we do not forget and we do not forgive,  the spokesperson in the video says.  The crimes committed by Gov. Snyder as well as other city officials will not go unpunished. The next day a cyber-attack rocked the Hurley Medical Center. That s the hospital where Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha first noticed there were elevated levels of lead in children s blood in Flint.Here s the video: Hurley Medical Center has IT systems in place, which aid in detecting a virus or cyber-attack,  hospital spokeswoman Ilene Cantor said.  As such, all policies and protocols were followed in relation to the most-recent cyber-attack on our system. Patient care was not compromised and we are closely monitoring all systems to ensure IT security is consistently maintained. It hasn t been confirmed that the cyber-attack is connected to Anonymous. However, it would be a pretty big coincidence for Anonymous to make this threat, and then for a completely random hack to occur. I think it is pretty safe to assume that if it was Anonymous who did hack the Hurley Medical Center, it was in an effort to get info on the situation. Not to actually harm the hospital. Or at the very least, to let the Snyder administration know that they mean business.Speaking of Snyder, he should be very concerned about the potential threat of a massive data breach. In his State of the State address on Tuesday, Snyder promised he would release all of his e-mails in a show of transparency. That promise just turned out to be another slap to well, at this point, the entire nation, who is watching him like a hawk. Here is an example of what  transparency  means to Snyder:That s not the kind of bullsh*t you want to be pulling with a hacker group breathing down your neck. With all things Anonymous, it is important to maintain a healthy dose of skepticism. That being said, it will be interesting to see if they escalate their fight with Snyder and the rest of his cronies in the near future. Especially since his administration has landed Michigan s government the honor of being ranked worst in transparency.Featured Image Credit: Video Screenshot via YouTube ',\n",

       " 'KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir visited the war-torn Darfur region on Tuesday in an effort to show his country is ready to have 20-year-old sanctions lifted by the United States just weeks before Washington is expected to issue a decision. In July the Trump administration postponed for three months the decision to permanently lift sanctions, setting Oct. 12 as a deadline for Sudan to meet conditions, including resolving conflicts and stepping up its humanitarian efforts.   Conflict in Darfur began in 2003 when mainly non-Arab tribes took up arms against Sudan s Arab-led government. A joint African Union-U.N. peacekeeping operation, known as UNAMID, has been on the ground for the past decade. Fighting between the army and rebels in the southern Kordofan and Blue Nile regions also broke out again in 2011, when South Sudan declared independence. Sudan had announced short-term truces in these regions in June and October 2016, after which fighting eased in Blue Nile and Kordofan but carried on in Darfur. Bashir has extended a ceasefire in response to the U.S. moves.  After security and stability, comes development,  Bashir said in a speech. He said Darfur s security has begun recovering and insisted that arms will only be in the hands of state forces.  Just before leaving office, former U.S. President Barack Obama temporarily eased penalties against Sudan, suspending a trade embargo, unfreezing assets and removing sanctions.  His decision was delayed for six months to allow Sudan time to meet the conditions which also included cooperating with the U.S. to fight terrorism and improving its rights record. Gabriel Belal, the spokesman of the Justice and Equality movement, one of the main rebel groups in Darfur, criticized Bashir s two-day visit, saying it aimed to give a wrong image to the international community that the war was over.   Bashir s visit is not welcomed by the people of Darfur because he personally issued direct orders for ethnic cleansing,  Belal said.   Security, humanitarian and political conditions are tense in Darfur and there s no prospect for a political resolution.      ',\n",
       " 'Not that it matters, but since it appears that no one has read the bill, it s probably not that unlikely that Democrat senator Ron Wyden misspoke In a speech on the Senate floor on May 22, Democratic senator Ron Wyden of Oregon ridiculed those who thought climate change regulation would be part of Obamatrade:We ve heard suggested, for example, that it s a backdoor route to immigration reform or action on climate change . My sense is that the rate these hypotheticals are going, you re bound to hear that a future president working on a trade deal might have second thoughts about the Louisiana purchase.But in an interview on NPR s Marketplace yesterday (June 3), President Obama said that enforcing climate change regulations will indeed be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Obamatrade pact that he is currently negotiating with Malaysia and 10 other countries. He said:If we want to solve something like climate change, which is one of my highest priorities, then I ve got to be able to get into places like Malaysia, and say to them, this is in your interest. What leverage do I have to get them to stop deforestation? Well part of the leverage is if I m in a trade relationship with them that allows me to raise standards.In December, Obama will negotiate a multi-country climate agreement in Paris. We already know from Obama s joint announcement with China that he will commit the United States to a huge reduction in carbon emissions of 26%-28% from 2005 levels, but he will let China, already a much larger carbon emitter, continue to expand its carbon emissions until 2030.Via: American Thinker',\n",
       " 'Tara Zoumer thought she had found her dream job when she was hired at WeWork, a $16 billion   that rents office space to young entrepreneurs. The walls were adorned with Pop Art. Neon light fixtures encouraged employees to â\\x80\\x9cHustle harder,â\\x80\\x9d and there was beer on tap. â\\x80\\x9cIt was like walking onto a set of a movie,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Zoumer said. But shortly after she became an associate community manager in WeWorkâ\\x80\\x99s office in Berkeley, Calif. reality set in. Ms. Zoumer said she was feeling pinched because her annual salary was only $42, 000, a sum that, on some weeks, left her without money to ride the subway. She said she thought many of her duties  â\\x80\\x94   leading tours for prospective tenants, tidying up, answering phones and changing the kegs  â\\x80\\x94   were more suited to an hourly wage with a possibility for overtime. Ms. Zoumer tried to enlist colleagues to file what she hoped would be a   lawsuit to fight for overtime pay. But the company had instituted a policy that could force employees to ultimately resolve disputes through arbitration instead of the courts, which essentially shut down Ms. Zoumerâ\\x80\\x99s lawsuit, since arbitration bars individuals from joining in a class action. When Ms. Zoumer refused to sign the new policy, she was fired. As     like WeWork grow  â\\x80\\x94   the companyâ\\x80\\x99s work force has swelled to 1, 500 from 300 a year ago  â\\x80\\x94   they are taking a page from the playbook of big corporations, which are increasingly using arbitration to thwart employees from bringing any meaningful legal challenge in court, an investigation by The New York Times found last fall. Uber and Lyft, the   services, make their drivers sign an arbitration clause. Square, the mobile payment processor, also requires that employees agree to bring disputes to arbitration. In advice to   Brotman Law, a tax firm in San Diego, promotes the benefits of arbitration for â\\x80\\x9ccompanies doing business over the Internet,â\\x80\\x9d emphasizing that it â\\x80\\x9ccan save significant costs. â\\x80\\x9d Amazon and Google also use arbitration to resolve disputes with customers. Far from burying its arbitration clause in its employment contracts, WeWork is proud of its policy. The companyâ\\x80\\x99s top executives said they thought that by adopting an arbitration clause as part of a broader dispute resolution program, they were staying true to their principles, which prize all levels of employees as members of a single community. WeWork says its employees are eligible for bonuses and equity in the company in addition to their salaries. â\\x80\\x9cWe want to show the world that this works,â\\x80\\x9d Jennifer Berrent, WeWorkâ\\x80\\x99s general counsel and chief culture officer, a recently created position, said of the dispute resolution program. For    â\\x80\\x94   many of which began in Silicon Valley  â\\x80\\x94   the clauses can seem to conflict with professed goals of upending business as usual and being open with employees. Arbitration, by its very nature, is a secretive process that is often lopsided in favor of the employer. That secrecy, federal labor officials said, can allow widespread problems to persist because the process bars employees from sharing their experiences with others who might be in similar positions. â\\x80\\x9cThey give their young workers   tables and take away their constitutional rights,â\\x80\\x9d said Cliff Palefsky, an employment and civil rights lawyer in San Francisco. This month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed a rule that would limit financial companies from using arbitration to prevent their customers from filing   lawsuits. But the rule does not apply to arbitration used in employment disputes. As Silicon Valley companies grow from small   into major employers, their labor practices are coming into focus. Despite the popular image that the industry is predominantly made up of nerdy millionaires, many of these growing companies depend increasingly on   employees. And with some technology companies now working harder to raise money, there are growing pressures on these companies from investors to cut costs  â\\x80\\x94   pressures that can fall disproportionately on the workers at the lower rungs. At WeWork, Ms. Berrent said, arbitration is part of a multistep process to resolve disputes. The company adopted the policy after months of discussion about how to deal most fairly with complaints. At the outset of the process, WeWork requires employees to raise any complaints with their managers. If that does not work, the employee and WeWork must try mediation. Only if that fails does the issue go before an arbitrator, whose decision is binding. Ms. Berrent said this process was in keeping with the companyâ\\x80\\x99s values, settling problems â\\x80\\x9cthrough open collaborationâ\\x80\\x9d rather than the courts. She confirmed that Ms. Zoumer was fired for not signing the arbitration clause. She said the employees who hold the job that Ms. Zoumer used to have were the â\\x80\\x9csoulâ\\x80\\x9d of the company and its â\\x80\\x9cbrand ambassadors. â\\x80\\x9d She said they performed tasks that were far from menial and were not suited to an hourly wage. Ms. Berrent also notes that while lawsuits are both costly for the employee and confrontational, the company pays for arbitration no matter who wins. Unprotected by an arbitration clause, companies can face litigation that could result in huge settlements. The drug company Novartis paid $175 million to settle a   suit brought by female employees over promotions and pay. And more than money can be at stake Nike had to overhaul its business practices after   employees sued over discrimination. At large corporations, many employees have come to expect the clauses as standard. But those working at smaller firms that claimed to treat their employees like family tend to be surprised when they collide with one. When Kevin Ziober, a Navy reservist in Costa Mesa, Calif. first joined BLB Resources, which manages foreclosed properties, the company was just beginning Mr. Ziober was the 18th person hired. Mr. Ziober had already been at the company for several months when he was asked to sign the arbitration policy in January 2011. He did so without a second thought. It was a decision he would regret. In the fall of 2012, he informed BLB Resources that he was being deployed to Afghanistan. On his last day, the company threw him a farewell party, complete with a cake shaped like an American flag. â\\x80\\x9cI was on Cloud 9,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Ziober said, recalling how he phoned his family to tell them about the party. That afternoon, as Mr. Ziober said he was packing up his cubicle, he was called into the human resources office and was â\\x80\\x9csummarilyâ\\x80\\x9d fired, according to his legal appeal. The reason for his termination, the company said, was that he was not being included in a federal contract that the company was applying for. In a statement, BLB said the decision not to include Mr. Ziober in the contract occurred months before he informed the company that he was being deployed. The statement added that BLB had offered to allow Mr. Ziober to work on the remainder of his existing contract if he returned in time from his deployment. In 2014, after returning from Afghanistan, he sued BLB Resources for violating a federal law, known informally as Userra, that protects the jobs of service members while they are deployed. A California judge ruled that he would have to take his claim to arbitration. Mr. Zioberâ\\x80\\x99s lawyer, Peter   has appealed the case, arguing that Userra preserves the rights of service members to go to court. BLB said in a statement that â\\x80\\x9cthe company is extremely disappointed about Mr. Zioberâ\\x80\\x99s allegations and denies them wholeheartedly. â\\x80\\x9d With their appeal, Mr. Ziober has waded into an intense battle playing out across the country. In Washington, a group of bipartisan lawmakers introduced a bill in 2014 that would exempt service members from having to take claims of wrongful auto repossession or improper debt collection to arbitration. An almost identical bill was quashed after intense lobbying by big banks and credit card companies, never making it out of committee. A bill in California that would have prevented companies from requiring employees to sign arbitration clauses suffered a similar fate when Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed it last year. The legislative skirmishes point to just how valuable arbitration has become to companies and just how far they will go to defend it. Despite WeWorkâ\\x80\\x99s arbitration requirement, Ms. Zoumer decided to sue the company on her own, hoping she would prevail in overturning the clause. Ms. Zoumerâ\\x80\\x99s lawyer, Ramsey Hanafi, filed her case in December over wrongful termination and unfair labor practices, and Boies, Schiller  Flexner, a top corporate defense firm, is representing WeWork. Ms. Zoumer, 31, said she knew she was taking a risk when she challenged WeWork over arbitration. She told the company she needed at least a week to review the policy before deciding whether to sign it. In an email to colleagues, she encouraged them to do the same, citing The Timesâ\\x80\\x99s investigation into arbitration. Ms. Berrent said Ms. Zoumer was the only employee who refused to sign other than two employees who had planned to leave the company anyway. Ultimately, no other employees joined Ms. Zoumerâ\\x80\\x99s lawsuit. â\\x80\\x9cYounger people donâ\\x80\\x99t want to pick fights, but we are losing our rights,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Zoumer said.',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - The U.S. Congress should consider overhauling its system of benefits for disabled people in Puerto Rico, who get almost no government help, according to a new report by a task force addressing the islandâ\\x80\\x99s economic crisis. The report, released Tuesday, cited a December 9 Reuters investigation that detailed the scant support for island residents with severe mental and physical problems.  Most get nothing. Those who do get benefits receive an average of $74 a month - about a tenth of what the U.S. gives the disabled in its 50 states. Reuters also revealed wide disparities in support among U.S. territories.  Read the Special Report here: reut.rs/2hg0vDR Sen. Orrin Hatch - a Republican from Utah who heads the bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Economic Growth in Puerto Rico - did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday. The task force recommended that Congress consider providing Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories the same Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits it grants to the states.  Four of five U.S. territories - Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands - have been excluded from SSI since the program launched in the 1970s. The fifth territory, the Northern Mariana Islands, gets the same SSI benefits as a state, with an average payment of $560 monthly, in part because it negotiated its territory status at about the same time Congress enacted the SSI program.  Disabled Puerto Ricans, by contrast, receive much less through a nearly forgotten program administered by the Administration of Children and Families (ACF), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Nearly half of Puerto Ricoâ\\x80\\x99s disabled residents live in poverty - twice the rate of those in the 50 states. The disabled in Guam receive an average of $164, and in the Virgin Islands, $176. Disabled people in American Samoa get nothing.  SSI offers disabled residents of U.S. states up to $733 each month and pays an average of $540. As an alternative to giving the territories SSI benefits, the task force suggested Congress could increase benefits through ACF. Federal funding for the program has been capped since 1996 and is not indexed for inflation. The panel also recommended that ACF publicly release up-to-date information about the benefits paid to disabled citizens of U.S. territories. When Reuters first requested comment on benefits for the disabled in Puerto Rico, ACF declined to make anyone available because â\\x80\\x9cno one is completely versed in all the details,â\\x80\\x9d said spokesman Pat Fisher.  On Wednesday, Fisher declined to comment on the task force recommendations. â\\x80\\x9cWe cannot offer an opinion on proposed policy,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cWe only carry out approved policy.â\\x80\\x9d A 2014 study by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, found that if Puerto Rico received SSI, eligibility would expand ten-fold from nearly 34,500 in 2011 to 354,000 people. The federal governmentâ\\x80\\x99s payments to the island would skyrocket from $24 million to as much as $1.8 billion annually.  The task force also made recommendations about how to improve health care in Puerto Rico, which the group described as â\\x80\\x9ca serious and urgent issue.â\\x80\\x9d For decades, the U.S. offered lower payments to Puerto Rico under the federally sponsored Medicare and Medicaid insurance programs, which cover most people on the island.Â\\xa0The Medicaid insurance program for the poor, for example, has had its funding capped by Washington for decades, spurring island officials to borrow heavily through municipal bonds.  That contributed to what is now the largest municipal debt crisis in U.S. history. An estimated one-third of Puerto Ricoâ\\x80\\x99s $70 billion of outstanding debt stems from bonds issued to shore up healthcare funding. Reuters reported in October that Puerto Ricoâ\\x80\\x99s physicians are fleeing the islandâ\\x80\\x99s financially strapped healthcare system for high-paying and more stable jobs in the 50 states. The resulting shortage of doctors has exacerbated waits for appointments on the island to longer than 18 months in some specialties. Read the Special Report here: reut.rs/2e4T00o The most-cited reason for giving Puerto Rico unequal treatment in Medicaid and other programs is because Puerto Ricans do not pay federal income taxes. Some members of the task force believe that may warrant lower allocations for social welfare on the island, according to the report. Other members disagreed.  All members, however, agreed â\\x80\\x9cmore equitable treatment should still be considered,â\\x80\\x9d according to the report. That would reduce the incentive for Puerto Rico residents to migrate to U.S. states, as they have in large numbers for decades, leaving behind a more vulnerable population. The panel urged Congress to begin addressing the funding issues early next year, and suggested federal funding of the islandâ\\x80\\x99s Medicaid program be â\\x80\\x9cmore closely tied to the size and needs of the territoryâ\\x80\\x99s low-income population.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",

Clinton has struggled to win over some liberal backers of rival Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont, since beating him for the Democratic nomination this month. She hopes the support of Warren can help her in that effort as she campaigns against Trump for the Nov. 8 election. Warren, who has vigorously attacked Trump in recent weeks, called him â\\x80\\x9ca small, insecure money grubber who fights for no one but himselfâ\\x80\\x9d and warned: â\\x80\\x9cHe will crush you into the dirt to get whatever he wants. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s who he is.â\\x80\\x9d The capacity crowd repeatedly roared its approval, and a line of supporters who could not get inside stretched out the door and down the street. At one point, Warren stopped her speech to turn and applaud Clinton, a former secretary of state. â\\x80\\x9cShe knows what it takes to beat a thin-skinned bully who is driven by greed and hate,â\\x80\\x9d said Warren, known for calling for reining in Wall Street and eradicating income inequality. WARREN â\\x80\\x98A SELLOUTâ\\x80\\x99 - TRUMP In a statement, Trump called Warren â\\x80\\x9ca selloutâ\\x80\\x9d for backing Clinton, who has taken donations from Wall Street interests and once backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Asian trade deal. Clinton has since reversed her trade stance. In an interview with NBC News, Trump called Warren â\\x80\\x9ca fraudâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9ca racist,â\\x80\\x9d accusing her of making up claims about her Native American heritage to advance her career. He again called Warren â\\x80\\x9cPocahontas,â\\x80\\x9d the name of a 17th-century Native American figure, to draw attention to a controversy first raised during Warrenâ\\x80\\x99s 2012 Senate race in Massachusetts. â\\x80\\x9cShe is one of the least productive senators in the United States Senate,â\\x80\\x9d Trump told NBC. â\\x80\\x9cWe call her Pocahontas for a reason.â\\x80\\x9d Two other potential Clinton vice presidential picks - U.S. senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Sherrod Brown of Ohio - rejected Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s assertion and defended Warrenâ\\x80\\x99s record. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s what he does, he attacks people. He acts like heâ\\x80\\x99s attacking their character - heâ\\x80\\x99s attacking his own character when he does that,â\\x80\\x9d Brown told Reuters. â\\x80\\x9cYou canâ\\x80\\x99t believe anything Donald Trump says. Period,â\\x80\\x9d Kaine told Reuters. Taking the microphone in Ohio, Clinton said she liked Warrenâ\\x80\\x99s aggressive approach to her Republican rival, who has sprayed rivals and critics with insults throughout his campaign. â\\x80\\x9cI just love how she gets under Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s skin,â\\x80\\x9d Clinton said. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s decision to campaign with Warren for the first time in Cincinnati, a city on Ohioâ\\x80\\x99s southwestern border with Kentucky and Indiana, underscored the swing stateâ\\x80\\x99s vital role in the November showdown with Trump. Ohio has backed every successful presidential nominee since 1964 and no Republican has won the White House without carrying the state.     Warrenâ\\x80\\x99s calls to rein in corporate excess could resonate with two groups Clinton must court in the election - Sanders supporters and those anxious about the economy who are drawn to Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s promise to toss out international trade deals. Ohioâ\\x80\\x99s manufacturing base has taken a hit in recent economic slowdowns, and Trump has identified it as a state where his anti-free trade rhetoric could resonate with alienated blue-collar voters. Since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee, Clinton has repeatedly tried to portray businessman Trump as fundamentally unfit for the presidency. Clinton said Warrenâ\\x80\\x99s long history of fighting for progressive economic values made her a perfect messenger for that critique. ',\n",

       " 'Picture it: Manhattan, 2017. A crisp Saturday morning. Every table in Rue La Rue Cafe  â\\x80\\x94   a new restaurant in Washington Heights dedicated to Rue McClanahan and her hit television series, â\\x80\\x9cThe Golden Girlsâ\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   was occupied, including one in a replica of the kitchen set from the show. The pumps Ms. McClanahan (Blanche) wore in the pilot episode are displayed in a glass case. Mannequins draped in her gowns surrounded a pianist and guitarist playing mellow jazz on a corner stage. Behind them, on a pedestal, was her 1987 Emmy for lead actress. When the musicians took a break, a mounted television was turned up so customers could watch episodes that play steadily. Conversation happily quieted as Bea Arthur (Dorothy) and Hal Linden were heard saying good night after a   date. â\\x80\\x9cThis is a museum!â\\x80\\x9d said a woman in line to order. From behind the counter, the   Michael J. LaRue, replied, â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a museum with good food. â\\x80\\x9d Few series radiate the necessary warmth to justify a tribute restaurant, but â\\x80\\x9cThe Golden Girls,â\\x80\\x9d that enduring electric blanket of American television, is a part of the culture that people have held tight. It has been 25 years since the end of the sitcom about four older Miami housemates  â\\x80\\x94   Dorothy, the salty wit Rose (Betty White) the lovable dim bulb Sophia (Estelle Getty) the Italian spitfire and Blanche, the Southern vixen  â\\x80\\x94   but fans keep finding new ways to love it, with countless parodies, action figures and   and Huluâ\\x80\\x99s recent nabbing of exclusive streaming rights. For all the showâ\\x80\\x99s zany plots, what fans seem to cherish most are the intimate scenes in which the four friends sit around their kitchen table, sharing a cheesecake and talking into the night. That spirit has now become a guiding force for Mr. LaRue, 53, who owns the restaurant with Ms. McClanahanâ\\x80\\x99s son, Mark Bish. Mr. LaRue first met Ms. McClanahan at an animal rights charity event at Studio 54. They quickly became best friends, he said, and she repeatedly asked him, in jest, to marry her so she could be Rue LaRue. When Ms. McClanahan died in 2010, he became the executor of her estate, which includes an extensive personal archive that Ms. McClanahan wanted made available to her fans. â\\x80\\x9cA little voice in my head said, â\\x80\\x98Restaurant! â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Mr. LaRue said during a recent interview. A   resident of Washington Heights, he had no other neighborhood in mind for the new spot. â\\x80\\x9cBefore, weâ\\x80\\x99d have to go downtown for good food and live entertainment,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI want people to stay in the neighborhood, and if they donâ\\x80\\x99t live here, to come uptown. â\\x80\\x9d Construction on the space, formerly a pet store, lasted nearly a year. The bathroom was outfitted to match the showâ\\x80\\x99s pink and mint tiles, with a bawdy door Ms. McClanahan had designed for her California house. The banana leaf Martinique wallpaper on two walls was   to match its exact look in Blancheâ\\x80\\x99s bedroom. CHOCnyc, an Inwood bakery, created a cheesecake in honor of each Girl, and the Bronx Brewery provided two custom beers. The menu, from Michele Weber, formerly the chef at Good Enough to Eat, will feature nods to the show  â\\x80\\x94   lasagna al forno, GenÃ¼genflÃ¼rgen cake  â\\x80\\x94   and recipes shared by the cast: Ms. Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s chutney, Ms. Whiteâ\\x80\\x99s angel food cake, Ms. Gettyâ\\x80\\x99s pasta salad. There are also signature coffee blends: Sophiaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cPicture Itâ\\x80\\x9d Sicilian Roast (inspired by a favorite line of the character) Roseâ\\x80\\x99s St. Olaf blend, Dorothyâ\\x80\\x99s   Roast, and, for a little spice, Blancheâ\\x80\\x99s Gentlemen Callerâ\\x80\\x99s Beans. â\\x80\\x9cMy grandma loved the show,â\\x80\\x9d said Patrick Rickerfor, 41, who was making his fourth visit to Rue La Rue. â\\x80\\x9cShe was from Honduras and didnâ\\x80\\x99t understand English all that well, but she got the slapstick comedy. â\\x80\\x9d Ana Perez, 28, was back for the second day in a row. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m a Blanche,â\\x80\\x9d she admitted proudly. Anabel Perez, 23, her sister, said, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m a Dorothy. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd weâ\\x80\\x99ve got a little Sophia over there,â\\x80\\x9d Ana added, gesturing to their young cousin, buried in a game on her smartphone. â\\x80\\x9cIt was my favorite show growing up. That episode where Mario Lopez got deported makes me cry. â\\x80\\x9d Junko (a Sophia) and Paul Lindberg (a Rose) were   when they noticed that the cafe had opened. They threw their bags down at home and raced over. â\\x80\\x9cWe used to walk by here every day, thinking, â\\x80\\x98Whenâ\\x80\\x99s it going to open? â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Lindberg said. â\\x80\\x9cMy mom in Japan keeps asking me, â\\x80\\x98Is that cafe open yet? â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Bix Gabriel, from Bloomington, Ind. and her sister Marisa Gabriel, from Adelaide, Australia, overheard talk of the place in an Ethiopian restaurant a few nights earlier and frantically Googled. â\\x80\\x9cWe sang the theme song coming in,â\\x80\\x9d Bix Gabriel said. â\\x80\\x9cThe show was so progressive and ahead of its time,â\\x80\\x9d Joe Samalian, Ms. Gabrielâ\\x80\\x99s husband, added. â\\x80\\x9cIt passes the Bechdel test like you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI must say,â\\x80\\x9d Marisa Gabriel said, leaning in, â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The Golden Girlsâ\\x80\\x99 is the best cure for postpartum depression. I have two children, and I watched it each time, and it helped me immensely. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. LaRue echoed a similar sentiment: â\\x80\\x9cI know people who put on â\\x80\\x98Golden Girlsâ\\x80\\x99 DVDs the way others take a Valium. â\\x80\\x9d One of the walls features photographs of Ms. McClanahanâ\\x80\\x99s six husbands, while another is dedicated to Ms. White, the last surviving Girl, who hopes to get to Rue La Rue in the spring. Near the end of Ms. McClanahanâ\\x80\\x99s life, Ms. White sent her a fresh orchid every week, as well as pears and oranges from California. â\\x80\\x9cShe would call and say, â\\x80\\x98Can I talk to Ruesy? â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Mr. LaRue recalled. â\\x80\\x9cOne day, right before the stroke, do you know what they were talking about? Ryan Reynolds. Betty was in that movie â\\x80\\x98The Proposal,â\\x80\\x99 and Rueâ\\x80\\x99s in the hospital, like, â\\x80\\x98Whoâ\\x80\\x99s that young man? Heâ\\x80\\x99s delicious.â\\x80\\x99 She was   up until the last minute of her life. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. LaRue is full of these stories, and happy to share them. â\\x80\\x9cShe sewed for me, she baked for me,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cMy mother died when I was 8 years old. I had this hole in my being that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t even realize. â\\x80\\x9d A sidewalk plaque at the entrance bears Ms. McClanahanâ\\x80\\x99s name and the opening lyrics of the showâ\\x80\\x99s theme song, â\\x80\\x9cThank You for Being a Friend. â\\x80\\x9d Some of her ashes are buried underneath. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s never a time when â\\x80\\x98The Golden Girlsâ\\x80\\x99 is not playing on this globe,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. LaRue said. â\\x80\\x9cIt taps into something that we all share as human beings  â\\x80\\x94   a fear that as we age weâ\\x80\\x99re going to become irrelevant and alone. The show is a tonic for that fear. It says you can still look good and have sex and have a very full life, with friends. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI once asked Rue why she got married so often, and she said, â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to die alone,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d he recalled. â\\x80\\x9cAnd she didnâ\\x80\\x99t I was there, holding her.

       " '(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday escalated his attacks on the federal judge presiding over lawsuits against Trump University, saying the judge had â\\x80\\x9can absolute conflictâ\\x80\\x9d because of his Mexican heritage, the Wall Street Journal reported. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, is fighting lawsuits that accuse his school venture of misleading thousands of people who paid up to $35,000 for seminars to learn about the billionaireâ\\x80\\x99s real estate investment strategies. In an interview with the newspaper, Trump said U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel had â\\x80\\x9can absolute conflictâ\\x80\\x9d in presiding over the litigation given that he was â\\x80\\x9cof Mexican heritageâ\\x80\\x9d and a member of a Latino lawyersâ\\x80\\x99 association. Trump said the background of the judge, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants, was relevant because of his campaign stance against illegal immigration and his pledge to seal the southern U.S. border, the Journal said. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m building a wall. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an inherent conflict of interest,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said, according to the newspaper. The New York businessman also alleged the judge was a former colleague and friend of one of the Trump University plaintiffsâ\\x80\\x99 lawyers, the newspaper said. The judge and the lawyer once worked together as federal prosecutors, but the lawyer, Jason Forge, in an interview with the Journal, said he had never seen the judge socially. â\\x80\\x9cNeither Judge Curielâ\\x80\\x99s ethnicity nor the fact that we crossed paths as prosecutors in the U.S. Attorneyâ\\x80\\x99s Office well over a decade ago is to blameâ\\x80\\x9d for Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s actions, Forge told the Journal. An assistant in Curielâ\\x80\\x99s chambers said he was not commenting on the matter, the newspaper said. At a rally in San Diego last week, Trump lashed out at Curiel.  â\\x80\\x9cI have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump. A hater. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a hater,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re in front of a very hostile judge. The judge was appointed by Barack Obama,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said, adding he believed Curiel was Mexican. Legal scholars said Trump could face consequences for slamming the judge, although many have speculated that Curiel was unlikely to sanction him formally. Trump has drawn criticism for his comments about immigrants from Mexico, some of whom he has said were criminals and rapists. He has proposed building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to prevent illegal immigration and requiring Mexico to pay for it. ',\n",
       " 'BERLIN (Reuters) - A mood of pre-election apathy rippled through German media on Monday, as commentators concluded Angela Merkel s rival for chancellor had blown his best chance of depriving her of fourth term in office. With three weeks to go until polling day, several national newspapers taking stock the morning after a lackluster two-way televised debate concluded that a re-run of the grand coalition of Merkel s conservatives and challenger Martin Schulz s Social Democrats (SPD) was likely.  Angela Merkel and Martin Schulz barely showed any differences in their only direct face-off. Why don t we just set the grand coalition up again now?  magazine Der Spiegel said on its website, adding the debate would not have changed voters  existing preferences. That would be a continuation of the team that has governed Germany for the last four years. But that combination has in the past been viewed as a last resort, and surveys suggest a three-way coalition between the conservatives, Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP) as an alternative option. Polls over the past three months have consistently shown Merkel s conservatives holding a double-digit lead over the SPD - but the gap has never stretched so far as to give her CDU/CSU alliance a parliamentary majority. Polls showed Merkel was also the winner of Sunday s duel - a disappointment for Schulz, who had hoped he could use his only direct clash with her to turn his party s fortunes around.  We re at risk of another grand coalition,  read the headline in mass-selling Bild newspaper. It said while Schulz had tried to attack  the eternal chancellor , he had done so with velvet gloves, pointing out that he often said he shared Merkel s opinion. Bild said the pair had failed to differentiate themselves.  There were two professional politicians speaking and you just couldn t shake off the suspicion that both of them could work together in government without much friction,  it added. Local newspaper Berliner Zeitung newspaper s front page showed a scorecard that read 0:0 - a draw for both candidates.  It was supposed to be the first climax in the race for the chancellery ... But substantive accents were missing. Undecided votes were likely unconvinced by either of the candidates,  it said. The rivals  body language was also telling, it said, with Schulz smiling a lot while Merkel often looked  as though she was witnessing something that she didn t quite like.  Newspaper Handelsblatt said Schulz had not really attacked the incumbent chancellor, adding:  Martin Schulz doesn t want to be chancellor in September apparently but rather Angela Merkel s office manager.  But Berlin s Tagesspiegel newspaper said Schulz had scored points for taking more decisive positions on Turkey, pensions and the need to punish the German automotive industry for the diesel emissions scandal.  When it came to showing hard edges, Martin Schulz was more convincing,  it said, adding,  this evening may have changed things.  ',\n",
       " 'One would think that, after all the accusations that Hillary lied to Congress about everything in all of creation, they d be especially sensitive to anybody else lying to them. Especially when it s easily proven. Trump s pick to head the EPA, Scott Pruitt, used a private email account for some of his government business during his tenure as Oklahoma s attorney general. It s not illegal for him to use private email under Oklahoma law as long as the emails are made publicly available, but they weren t, and he lied to Congress about it anyway.Pruitt answered a written questionnaire that asked him whether he used private email. He responded with: I use only my official OAG email address and government issued phone to conduct official business. He later told the Senate Energy and Public Works Committee that he didn t know why a personal email address was listed as part of his business addresses. 7,500 pages of emails, presumably from that address, have been released after an Oklahoma judge ruled that Pruitt had been withholding them illegally.Senate Democrats say this raises serious questions about Pruitt s credibility, which is already on shaky ground because he was suing the EPA as Oklahoma s attorney general. One of the concerns about his emails is that he was working closely with fossil fuel companies to resist the government s efforts to limit carbon emissions   something the fossil fuel industry and all its lackeys hate because it hurts profits.That s a serious conflict of interest, and lies about it just compound the whole situation.Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said of Pruitt s credibility: Now that he is in charge of protecting clean air and water in every community across the country, the public must decide for themselves whether they can trust Pruitt when he can t even be honest about his email or his ties to the oil and gas industry. Sen. John Barasso, a Wyoming Republican, wouldn t comment on the matter and other Republicans appear to be silent as well. Why? Likely because they want someone at the EPA who s willing to render it toothless, if not dismantle it entirely, and also because this reflects extremely badly on them given their insistence that Hillary s use of private email was the world s worst crime ever.Pruitt will probably remain at the head of the EPA even though lying to Congress is perjury. Republicans never want to admit when they ve screwed up.Featured image by Aaron P. Bernstein via Getty Images',\n",

       " 'Nogales, Ariz. (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Tuesday to make his case for increased prosecutions of illegal immigrants, pressuring U.S. attorneys to prioritize cases against criminal migrants. Sessions, a long-time proponent of tougher immigration enforcement, told U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at the Port of Nogales, Arizona, that more illegal migrants should be prosecuted as criminals.    It is normally the role of the Secretary of Homeland Security to meet border agents. But Sessions made the visit to highlight his focus on enforcing federal laws as dozens of U.S. cities try to shield illegal immigrants from stepped-up prosecution and deportation efforts. â\\x80\\x9cWhy are we doing this?â\\x80\\x9d the former U.S. senator said. â\\x80\\x9cBecause it is what the duly enacted laws of the United States require.â\\x80\\x9d   Sessions said that each U.S. attorney would be required to designate a point person on border security prosecutions by April 18. The person in that position, known as a border security coordinator, would be directed to coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security, according to Sessionsâ\\x80\\x99 memo.  The directive did not go beyond existing laws, but Sessions said his order â\\x80\\x9cmandates the prioritizations of such enforcementâ\\x80\\x9d by U.S. attorneys.  The Trump administration has threatened to cut off U.S. Justice Department grants to so-called sanctuary cities that fail to assist federal immigration authorities.  Police in such cities have argued that targeting illegal migrants is an improper use of law enforcement resources. Sessions has said a failure to deport aliens convicted of criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk. Under U.S. law, anyone who harbors or transports an undocumented immigrant, has crossed the border illegally two or more times, resists an immigration officerâ\\x80\\x99s arrest or commits travel document fraud is subject to criminal prosecution.  Other immigrants apprehended for crossing the border illegally face civil procedures, with deportation the only penalty.  Sessionsâ\\x80\\x99 announcement was the latest move by the Trump administration to deter illegal immigration. President Donald Trump has also called for not releasing migrants with pending court cases, targeting more people in immigration raids and building a wall on the southwest border.  Speaking just 50 yards from a border fence on the Arizona-Mexico border, Sessions said that adding more fencing to the border will be a â\\x80\\x9cforce multiplierâ\\x80\\x9d against illegal migration.  He also said the Justice Department plans to add 50 more immigration judges in 2017 and 75 more in 2018. Immigration judges oversee civil immigration cases, but there is a backlog of over 540,000 pending cases due a shortage of judges.  ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON  â\\x80\\x94   President Trump on Tuesday turned up the pressure on recalcitrant Republicans to support a sweeping bill to overhaul the health care system, threatening wavering lawmakers in his party with political payback if they failed to get behind a measure that has become an early test of his negotiating power. In a series of meetings and phone calls at the White House and on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Republican congressional leaders haggled with holdouts over details as they struggled to assemble a majority to support a bill that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The legislation is scheduled for a floor vote on Thursday in the House. But at a private meeting with House Republicans at the Capitol, the president also delivered a blunt warning that many of those present would lose their seats in next yearâ\\x80\\x99s midterm congressional elections if the effort failed. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m going to come after you,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump told Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, a prime holdout and the chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, a hotbed of concern about the legislation, according to several people in the room who described his comments on condition of anonymity because the session was private. â\\x80\\x9cI believe Mark and his group will come along, because honestly, a loss is not acceptable, folks. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump told Republicans at the meeting that after voting repeatedly to repeal the health care law and campaigning in 2016 on doing so, they had an obligation to back the bill and would lose their majority if they â\\x80\\x9cblow it,â\\x80\\x9d attendees said. Despite the dayâ\\x80\\x99s feverish efforts  â\\x80\\x94   a combination of cajoling, browbeating and   that recalled Democratsâ\\x80\\x99 efforts to pass the law in 2010  â\\x80\\x94   White House and congressional officials conceded Tuesday that they still lacked the votes to pass the bill. As many as three dozen Republicans remain opposed or unpersuaded, according to one aide with knowledge of the process, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. It is not clear whether Mr. Trump would be able to exact a political price from Republicans who opposed the measure conservative groups including the Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America were lining up against the legislation and pressuring lawmakers to oppose it, raising questions about whether it would be possible to mount a successful primary challenge to defectors. And some Republicans said the political peril would be greater if they supported the health care bill, which they said failed to achieve their goals or those of their constituents. â\\x80\\x9cI think if we do do this, we lose the majority,â\\x80\\x9d said Representative Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican and a member of the Freedom Caucus, who said he remained opposed. Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey, one of the nearly two dozen Republicans from districts that Mr. Trump lost in 2016, said he was leaning strongly toward a â\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x9d vote. â\\x80\\x9cI campaigned in support of a    bill that would make health care more affordable and accessible and provide a smooth transition to those who were forced into Obamacare through no fault of their own,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lance said. â\\x80\\x9cThe bill, as currently drafted, does none of these things. â\\x80\\x9d It is also not clear whether Mr. Trump, whose popularity has fallen from what was already a historically low point since he took office, is capable of rallying the public behind a plan that is also viewed negatively. Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s approval rating sank to 37 percent in Gallupâ\\x80\\x99s daily tracking poll on Monday. That is only slightly higher than the 34 percent who favor the health measure, according to a Fox News poll last week, compared with 54 percent who were opposed. The use of a political threat was a classic tactic for Mr. Trump, who keeps a running mental tally of his backers and detractors, and frequently boasts of his efforts to exact revenge from those who have crossed him. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re going to make sure to remember those who stood by us, and who stood by the word that they gave to their voters,â\\x80\\x9d said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. Mr. Trump has not focused on the specifics of the health care bill, arguing in recent days that he is more concerned with pushing it through Congress so he can move on to issues he cares more about, including a large tax cut. At a   for House Republicans on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said he was eager to cut taxes, but had â\\x80\\x9cno choiceâ\\x80\\x9d but â\\x80\\x9cto go with the health care first. â\\x80\\x9d But he has been putting the full power of the White House behind the effort to sell the health bill. Besides his meeting at the Capitol on Tuesday, he met at the White House with about a dozen members of the centrist Tuesday Group. On Wednesday morning, he is scheduled to meet with members of the Freedom Caucus. Over the weekend, he summoned three prominent conservative critics  â\\x80\\x94   Mr. Meadows, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Mike Lee of Utah  â\\x80\\x94   to his    estate in Florida for meetings with Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, to discuss their concerns about the bill. â\\x80\\x9cHe made it very clear heâ\\x80\\x99s all in on this legislation,â\\x80\\x9d said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. â\\x80\\x9cThis is a historic moment and a historic promise for Republicans to deliver on this Thursday. â\\x80\\x9d Speaker Paul D. Ryan was upbeat after the Capitol meeting. â\\x80\\x9cThe president just came here and knocked the ball out of the park,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cHe knocked the cover off the ball. â\\x80\\x9d But Mr. Meadows said he was neither bothered nor persuaded by Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s warning that he would lose his constituentsâ\\x80\\x99 support if he did not fall in line. â\\x80\\x9cI believe that Iâ\\x80\\x99m representing them in opposing this bill, because it wonâ\\x80\\x99t lower premiums,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cUntil it does, Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be a â\\x80\\x98no,â\\x80\\x99 even if it sends me home. â\\x80\\x9d A prime concern for holdouts was the measureâ\\x80\\x99s lack of provisions to relax federal health insurance regulations that require insurers to provide certain minimum benefits and to spend certain percentages of premium revenues on medical care. White House officials argued privately that if they included such language in the bill, they would run into procedural problems in the Senate, where the measure is to be considered under special rules that apply to â\\x80\\x9cbudget reconciliationâ\\x80\\x9d bills. Those rules allow such legislation to be approved with a simple majority  â\\x80\\x94   meaning Republicans could push the bill through without any Democratic backing  â\\x80\\x94   but to qualify, the provisions must affect spending or revenues. For other House members, the health bill has been an opportunity to deal. As part of the discussions, Representative Mario   Republican of Florida, made it clear to White House officials that he wanted assurances that the president would hold to his pledge to consider reversing President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s opening with Cuba, the White House official said. Mr.   backed the measure in the Budget Committee last week, although the official said there had been no explicit discussion of trading his vote for a promise on Cuba. Representative Claudia Tenney, Republican of New York, said she was likely to support the bill after House leaders added a section that would shift Medicaid costs from New Yorkâ\\x80\\x99s counties to the state government. House leaders also included provisions to allow states to impose a work requirement for certain   Medicaid beneficiaries, and to allow states to choose a   block grant to fund Medicaid. Both of those provisions were meant to win over conservatives, and Mr. Ryan presented the health bill on Tuesday as an improved product that had been refined as much as possible to reflect lawmakersâ\\x80\\x99 concerns  â\\x80\\x94   and that now needed to be approved so lawmakers could fulfill their promise to repeal the health law. â\\x80\\x9cIn this day and age, and in this business, in politics, if you get 85 percent of what you want, thatâ\\x80\\x99s pretty darn good,â\\x80\\x9d he told reporters.',\n",
       " ' (Corrects paragraph 7 to show Trump issued a warning on travel to Cuba, not a ban on travel to Cuba) HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba told senior U.S. officials during talks on migration in Havana on Monday that the U.S. decision to suspend visa processing at its embassy on the island was  seriously hampering  family relations and other people exchanges. Relations between the former Cold War foes became strained after Donald Trump became the U.S. President, partially reversing the thaw seen during Barack Obama s presidency.  In September, after allegations of incidents affecting the health of its diplomats in Havana, the U.S. administration reduced its embassy to a skeleton staff, resulting in the suspension of almost all visa processing.  The Cuban delegation expressed deep concern over the negative impact that the unilateral, unfounded and politically motivated decisions adopted by the U.S. government ... have on migration relations between both countries,  the Cuban foreign ministry said in a statement. The statement was issued after delegations led by Cuba s Foreign Ministry chief for U.S. Affairs Josefina Vidal and U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs John Creamer met to discuss migration issues. Many Cubans said they were heartbroken because they could not visit, or be with, their loved ones. While Cuba has a population of 11.2 million people, there are an estimated 2 million Cuban Americans in the United States.    The Trump administration also issued a warning on travel to Cuba and in October expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from Washington.  The Cuban foreign ministry said this had  seriously affected the functioning of the diplomatic mission, particularly the Consulate and the services it offers to Cubans residing in the United States . The U.S. decision to cancel the visits of official  delegations to Cuba was also having a  counterproductive effect  on cooperation in fields like migration, the ministry said. On the positive side, both the U.S. and Cuban delegations commented on the drop in illegal Cuban migration to the United States during the talks as a result of past moves towards normalizing relations. Obama, who announced the detente with Cuba nearly three years ago, eliminated a policy granting automatic residency to virtually all Cubans who arrived on U.S. turf in January, just before leaving office. Cuba had asked for the change for years, saying that policy encouraged dangerous journeys and people trafficking.  Apprehensions of Cuban migrants at U.S. ports of entry decreased by 64 percent from fiscal year 2016 to 2017, and maritime interdictions of Cuban migrants decreased by 71 percent,  the U.S. State Department said in a statement. Trump said in June he was canceling Obama s  terrible and misguided deal  with Havana, returning to Cold War rhetoric, and his administration has tightened trade and travel restrictions. He has however in practise left in place many of Obama s changes including restored diplomatic relations and resumed direct U.S.-Cuba commercial flights and cruise-ship travel. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The failure by President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans to dismantle Obamacare has infuriated the partyâ\\x80\\x99s conservative flank and is intensifying intra-party warfare ahead of the 2018 U.S. congressional elections.  Donors and activists upset by the collapse of the latest Senate healthcare bill said it hardened their determination to back conservative candidates in next yearâ\\x80\\x99s elections, even if that means ousting Republican incumbents. â\\x80\\x9cI am fed up. Iâ\\x80\\x99m beyond frustrated,â\\x80\\x9d said Mica Mosbacher, a Houston-based Republican fundraiser, who added she was â\\x80\\x9cextremely disappointed in Ted Cruz,â\\x80\\x9d a Republican U.S. senator from Texas who had threatened to oppose the latest healthcare bill because he wanted to see changes. Texas is scheduled to hold the first nominating primary of the midterm elections in March 2018.  Trump vowed during the 2016 election campaign to scrap the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s signature domestic achievement, which Republicans see as a costly government overreach. Democrats say it has extended health insurance to millions. The latest bill to overturn Obamacare failed on Tuesday after three Senate Republicans, including moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul, said they could not support it. Republicans narrowly control the chamber by 52-48.  In November 2018, all 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 seats in the Senate will be up for election. In the Senate, that includes 23 Democrats and eight Republicans, with several in both parties in fights expected to be competitive. If a large number of Republicans are forced to defend their seats against challengers from their own party in primary fights, Democrats will seek to exploit weakened candidates in the general election in their effort to wrest control of the House and Senate from Republicans. A shift of either chamber into Democratic hands would make it even more difficult for Trump to pass his agenda of tax reform, toughening immigration laws and rolling back Obamacare. Republicans have not delivered a significant legislative win on any topic since Trump took office in January.  Mosbacher said she was â\\x80\\x9cleaning toward supportingâ\\x80\\x9d Cruzâ\\x80\\x99s primary opponent, Stefano de Stefano, even though she served as fundraiser for the incumbentâ\\x80\\x99s 2012 campaign. Whoever prevails in that fight would likely face Beto Oâ\\x80\\x99Rourke, a well-funded Democrat, in the general election. Texas last elected a Democrat to the Senate in 1988. The conservative group Club For Growth has already begun interviewing Republican primary challengers it will consider backing next year.  â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll continue to push for full repeal of Obamacare, and weâ\\x80\\x99re disappointed Republicans have been unable to deliver on their seven-year promise,â\\x80\\x9d said Rachael Slobodien, a spokeswoman for Club for Growth. Club for Growth is not alone in its frustration over the defeat of the Obamacare repeal effort. David Bozell, president of ForAmerica, a conservative grassroots organization, said incumbents who failed to line up solidly behind repeal had â\\x80\\x9cshown some true colorsâ\\x80\\x9d and in doing so, were inviting primary fights for their partyâ\\x80\\x99s nomination. Republican Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada are top targets for conservative groups. Conservative Kelli Ward has already announced her candidacy challenging Flake, and is seeking to amass support as a more conservative option.  Dave Tamasi, a Republican lobbyist and fundraiser, said he thought it was too soon to know if the healthcare failure would hurt Republicans. â\\x80\\x9cOpponents may try to use today or the failure to pass a repeal of the Affordable Care Act to give their candidacy a little bit of a push. The question is can that fuel today sustain itself over the long term of an election cycle,â\\x80\\x9d he said. So far, Trump has been hedging his bets on the Republican primaries. But many of his allies are already backing conservative primary challengers. Trump has blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over Congressâ\\x80\\x99 inaction. Such criticisms could help turn next yearâ\\x80\\x99s elections into a referendum on congressional incumbents, rather than on the president himself.  â\\x80\\x9cI think we are entering an era of more primary challenges in general, The disappointment by activists over the inability for Republicans to repeal Obamacare only adds fuel to this fire,â\\x80\\x9d said Craig Robinson, former political director of the Iowa Republican Party.

       " '(Reuters) - When the lawyer for the former campaign manager of President Donald Trump attacked the money laundering charge brought against his client as flimsy, some legal experts say he may have pinpointed a potential weakness in the indictment by U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller. Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates both pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges that they failed to disclose they were lobbying for pro-Russia former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich between 2006 and 2015 and laundered tens of millions of dollars by funneling the money through dozens of companies, partnerships and bank accounts. In a court filing on Thursday, Manafort defense lawyer Kevin Downing said the money laundering count, the most serious facing his client with a 20-year maximum sentence, was based on a â\\x80\\x9ctenuous legal theoryâ\\x80\\x9d tying it to his failure to register as a foreign agent of the former Ukrainian leader.  Downing did not respond to a request for comment. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment. The language of the filing and defiant statements Downing made outside the courthouse following Manafortâ\\x80\\x99s arraignment on Monday suggest the lawyer is planning an aggressive defense of the charges, the first to be made public from Muellerâ\\x80\\x99s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Kremlin has denied meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictments issued on Monday. Downing will also be seeking to suppress evidence he said was improperly obtained by search warrant, according to an additional filing on Friday. Manafortâ\\x80\\x99s Virginia home was raided by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents over the summer. The money laundering statute targets financial transactions involving the proceeds of â\\x80\\x9cspecified unlawful activity.â\\x80\\x9d According to the Manafort indictment, the unlawful activity was his violation of the U.S. Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). Though the money laundering statute includes FARA violations, Seattle tax lawyer John Colvin said the charge against Manafort was not as straightforward as most other cases. â\\x80\\x9cIt doesnâ\\x80\\x99t fit the normal paradigmâ\\x80\\x9d of money-laundering cases involving criminal activity like drug trafficking, Colvin said. â\\x80\\x9cIt seems like a stretch to me.â\\x80\\x9d  Downing said in his Thursday filing that only six prosecutions have been brought for violating FARA in the last 50 years, producing only one conviction. By pointing out the lack of previous FARA prosecutions, former federal prosecutor Mark Lee, now a white-collar defense lawyer in Philadelphia, said Downing was likely trying to suggest Manafort may not even have known he was violating the law. The section cited by Mueller requires the FARA violation to be â\\x80\\x9cknowing and willful.â\\x80\\x9d Successfully casting doubt on whether Manafort intentionally violated FARA could knock out the money laundering charge, Lee said. â\\x80\\x9cIf you donâ\\x80\\x99t have a (specific unlawful activity), you canâ\\x80\\x99t by definition have a laundering,â\\x80\\x9d said Lee. Former federal prosecutor Michael Padula, now a Miami defense lawyer, said parts of the money laundering statute also require funds to â\\x80\\x9cpromoteâ\\x80\\x9d an ongoing criminal enterprise. That may be hard to show in the Manafort case, where the proceeds went to purchase real estate, expensive suits and Range Rovers for the conspiratorâ\\x80\\x99s personal use. But other lawyers said they doubted defense arguments regarding FARA would gain much traction. â\\x80\\x9cThe idea that somebody of Mr. Manafortâ\\x80\\x99s background and sophistication would not understand that, if he did what he is alleged to have done, he would be required to file as an agent of a foreign government, is, I think, laughable,â\\x80\\x9d said Chicago lawyer and former federal prosecutor Patrick Cotter. Several lawyers noted that, even without the money laundering counts, Mueller had strong charges based on the failure of Manafort and Gates to report their overseas accounts to the Internal Revenue Service and that the entirety of the case appeared to be backed by strong documentary evidence. They also pointed out that Mueller could add more charges at a later date. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s an argument, not a get out of jail free card,â\\x80\\x9d said Padula of Downingâ\\x80\\x99s money laundering defense. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s still got a tough road ahead of him.â\\x80\\x9d  ',\n",
       " 'We recently reported about the deadly Zika virus coming to America from Central America. Today, the WHO Organization is issuing a stern warning about the spread of this deadly virus in the Americas.  US Border Agents warned us about the potentially deadly viruses illegal aliens were bringing across our borders over a year ago. Even CDC employees openly complained about being sick of dealing with the number of sick illegal aliens flowing across our borders. The World Health Organization warned today it expects that the Zika Virus that has spread rapidly through the Americas, particularly South America, to being  spreading explosively  throughout the Americas. One official it expects up to 4 million cases in the region in just the next year.The virus, which is spread by mosquitoes, affects mainly pregnant women, causing debilitating, sometimes deadly, brain damage to fetuses. Although there isn t a direct link, statistics are strong that children born from women who have the virus are more likely to suffer microcephaly, a neurological disorder that result in babies with unusually small heads. Many of the children also suffer Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that can lead to life-threatening paralysis.The level of concern is high, as is the level of uncertainty,  WHO s director general Dr. Margaret Chan said. We need to get some answers quickly. Dr. Chan called an emergency committee meeting Monday in Geneva, Switzerland, to address the Zika virus  spread. Currently, there is no way to treat Zika and authorities are concentrating their efforts on controlling the mosquito population. Via: OraTVThe virus is transmitted by the bite of Aedes aegypti mosquitos, which are found in all countries in the Americas, including the U.S., bar Canada and mainland Chile.Reports that the disease can be transmitted by sex are unconfirmed by the World Health Organization or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC). It is unclear if the virus can be transmitted through human blood.Aedes mosquitos also spread the more-common dengue fever and chikungunya. Zika symptoms are typically similar to these viruses, but milder, including fever and skin rash, usually accompanied by conjunctivitis and muscle or joint pain.The outbreak has led to reports of increased numbers of women in Brazil giving birth to babies with microcephaly, a rare condition that causes the brain to develop abnormally in the womb and results in a very small head.In addition, there are reports of adult Zika suffers subsequently developing Guillain-Barre syndrome, another rare but serious nervous system disorder that can cause muscle weakness, poor coordination and paralysis.No direct links between Zika and Guillain-Barre syndrome have yet been established. It is unclear if the virus can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or birth, although this is can occur with both dengue and chikungunya.Cases among travelers returning to mainland U.S. have already been reported and these instances were seen increasing by the CDC, which has warned that imported cases could cause the virus to spread in some areas of the country.The World Health Organization warned on Tuesday that the outbreak would likely reach all countries and territories in the Americas with Aedes mosquitos.Barbados Bolivia Brazil Cape Verde Colombia Dominican Republic Ecuador El Salvador French Guiana Guatemala Guadeloupe Guyana Haiti Honduras Martinique Mexico Panama Paraguay Puerto Rico Saint Martin Samoa Suriname Venezuela ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and the U.S. House of Representativesâ\\x80\\x99 top tax law writer reopened the door on Wednesday to changes in the 401(k) retirement savings program, just days after Trump seemed to rule out such a step under a broad Republican tax overhaul project. Trump told reporters he wants to protect the popular tax-deferred savings program, but said it was possible it could be part of congressional negotiations over tax cuts. â\\x80\\x9cMaybe weâ\\x80\\x99ll use it as negotiating, but trust me ... there are certain kinds of deals you donâ\\x80\\x99t want to negotiate with,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said on the White House South Lawn as he prepared to depart on a trip to Dallas. On Capitol Hill, Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means committee, said Trump and lawmakers were discussing how to handle 401(k) plans. The employer-administered plans have been used for four decades by millions of workers to save for retirement. â\\x80\\x9cNo decisionâ\\x80\\x99s yet been made on if there will be any changes,â\\x80\\x9d Brady told reporters. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re simply considering ideas to help people save more and save early in life. â\\x80\\x9cIf we can reach consensus on that, including with the president, in a good way, weâ\\x80\\x99ll move forward -  but if not, we will keep things as they are,â\\x80\\x9d Brady said. â\\x80\\x9cAll the focus is on can we help people save more.â\\x80\\x9d Currently, employees may contribute up to $18,000 a year to the tax-deferred accounts, with those 50 and older able to contribute up to $24,000. Savings are typically invested in mutual funds. Brady was expected to introduce tax overhaul legislation next week, as Trump has long promised. Republican leaders want Congress to approve the measure by the end of this year. It includes a sharp cut in the corporate tax rate. But many details are still being worked out, including how to offset revenue that would be lost to tax cuts. One way to do that might be to limit pre-tax 401(k) contributions, which would help the government realize more revenue in the near term but would result in a decline in revenue generation down the road.  Earlier this week, after The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported that Republicans were considering capping annual contributions at $2,400, Trump wrote on Twitter: â\\x80\\x9cThere will be NO change to your 401(k)â\\x80\\x9d. Tampering with 401(k) plans, which have largely replaced defined benefit pensions in the United States, would risk alienating tens of millions of workers, as well as the mutual fund operators which rely on the plans for much of their business. Many companies match a percentage of their employeesâ\\x80\\x99 401(k) contributions. Changes to the tax-deferred savings program could also provide ammunition to Democrats, who have painted Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s plan, with its $6 trillion in tax cuts, as a gift to the rich and corporate America that would balloon the federal deficit.

       " 'If ever there was a moment for Donald J. Trump to share the spotlight, his formal announcement of his running mate on Saturday was it. Instead, his introduction of Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana was a remarkable reminder that ultimately, the Trump campaign is about one person. He called Mr. Pence his â\\x80\\x9cpartner,â\\x80\\x9d but before the governor took the stage, Mr. Trump stood there alone and talked for 28 minutes, delivering a long and improvised riff that emulated his rallies instead of a traditional   debut. Looking away from his notes, he talked about Hillary Clinton, terrorism, his primary victories, his crushing of a â\\x80\\x9cStop Trumpâ\\x80\\x9d movement. Donald Trump, Mr. Trump said, understands infrastructure and how to build a border wall. He even got in a plug for his new hotel in Washington. After roughly 20 minutes, Mr. Trump reached for his notes. â\\x80\\x9cBack to Mike Pence!â\\x80\\x9d he declared, turning to Mr. Penceâ\\x80\\x99s record of job creation in Indiana. Then he used the reference to the Hoosier State to remind the 150 people in attendance that he had trounced Mr. Penceâ\\x80\\x99s endorsed candidate, Senator Ted Cruz, in the primary there. When Mr. Trump ultimately ceded the microphone to Mr. Pence, rather than stand beside him while he delivered his remarks, Mr. Trump patted him twice on the left shoulder and walked off the stage.   rollouts are usually a carefully orchestrated high point of a presidential campaign, but Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s has been unusual and chaotic from the start. Typically, the   candidate is given a moment to shine. But Mr. Trump spoke for more than twice as long as Mr. Pence, whose speech clocked in at roughly 12 minutes. Indeed, the event, in a ballroom at a Midtown Manhattan Hilton, had the feel of    news conferences lacking a recurring theme. Mr. Trump referred to the two men as â\\x80\\x9cthe    candidates,â\\x80\\x9d adding that â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99re the    party. â\\x80\\x9d He said that Mr. Pence â\\x80\\x9clooks good,â\\x80\\x9d and that â\\x80\\x9cto be honest,â\\x80\\x9d part of the reason for Mr. Penceâ\\x80\\x99s selection was to unify the party. Then Mr. Trump proceeded to mock those Republicans who had opposed him. Mr. Trump, who eschewed a teleprompter despite aidesâ\\x80\\x99 attempts to impose discipline on his speeches, also unveiled a new attack against Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. He described her as something of a foreign policy puppeteer who had led President Obama down unfortunate paths across the globe. Mr. Trump conspicuously tried to tamp down reports that he had vacillated about Mr. Pence as his choice as late as Thursday night, saying he was his â\\x80\\x9cfirst choiceâ\\x80\\x9d all along. Mr. Pence, a relative stranger to Mr. Trump, also said he had received a call on Wednesday about serving on the ticket. Mr. Pence left most of the   role that is typical of a running mate to Mr. Trump. Instead, he spoke softly and with humility about a   upbringing and his spirituality. He also seemed more mindful than Mr. Trump of the need to present a united front, a particular challenge given the fractured state of the Republican Party and the two candidatesâ\\x80\\x99 own considerable differences. He sought to glide over his previous criticism of Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s proposed ban on Muslim immigrants, choosing instead to criticize Mrs. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s call to take in more Syrian refugees. He did not speak with any depth about trade pacts, which he has supported in the past and which are a target of Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s criticism. While Mr. Trump was freewheeling, Mr. Pence was smooth and polished, bringing the guests to their feet when he said he was joining the ticket â\\x80\\x9cbecause Hillary Clinton can never become president of the United States. â\\x80\\x9d He cast the 2016 election in familiar terms that could soothe Republicans anxious about their unusual nominee. Mr. Pence called himself â\\x80\\x9ca Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,â\\x80\\x9d a phrase that has become his trademark, and he described Mr. Trump as a â\\x80\\x9cpatriotic American. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDonald Trump is a good man, and he will make a great president of the United States,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Pence said, adding, â\\x80\\x9cI know what all of America will soon know: These are good people. â\\x80\\x9d Afterward, the Pence family and the Trump family came onstage, save for Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s wife, Melania, who was said to be at their golf club in Bedminster, N. J. with their young son, Barron. The two men then worked a rope line with attendees. The oversize ballroom felt cavernous the event was originally scheduled for a smaller space on Friday, but Mr. Trump postponed the announcement, saying it was out of respect for the tragedy in Nice, France. Few local Republican leaders were in attendance most had already decamped for the convention in Cleveland. The entire production was over in less than an hour. The candidates did not take questions, but they sat together Saturday for their first joint interview, with Lesley Stahl of CBSâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9c60 Minutes,â\\x80\\x9d set to air Sunday night. Ms. Stahl asked Mr. Pence, who publicly swore off negative campaigning years ago, how he could run with a candidate so reflexively given to  . Mr. Pence evaded the question, saying the campaign had been about â\\x80\\x9cissues the American people care about,â\\x80\\x9d but Mr. Trump eventually gave him an assist. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re different people,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump said. â\\x80\\x9cI understand that. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll give you an example: Hillary Clinton is a liar. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Pence, after stopping to eat at a Chiliâ\\x80\\x99s, flew back to Indiana  â\\x80\\x94   without Mr. Trump  â\\x80\\x94   for what was billed as a â\\x80\\x9cWelcome Homeâ\\x80\\x9d rally at an airport hangar in Zionsville. Mr. Pence, joined by his wife, Karen, and daughter Charlotte, offered just eight minutes of remarks as humble as the tableau that awaited him. â\\x80\\x9cThe last few days have been truly overwhelming, but this is the best part,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Pence said, gazing upon the crowd of roughly 500. â\\x80\\x9cKaren and I will cherish this Hoosier homecoming for the rest of our lives. â\\x80\\x9d Afterward, he beckoned to a close friend in the crowd and embraced him tightly over the metal barricades. â\\x80\\x9cBuckle up,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Pence said with a smile.',\n",

       " 'The combination of a shallow fault and old, unreinforced masonry buildings led to widespread devastation in the earthquake that struck central Italy early Wednesday. The  .2 quake killed at least 241 people and left hundreds more injured. Many people were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings. Like other villages and towns in the mountainous area, Amatrice, where the mayor lamented that â\\x80\\x9chalf the town no longer exists,â\\x80\\x9d has stone churches and other buildings that were constructed centuries ago, when little if anything was known about earthquakes. Unless they have been reinforced in recent years, such structures are easily damaged or destroyed by shaking. â\\x80\\x9cEven 100 years ago, they didnâ\\x80\\x99t know how to build structures to withstand earthquakes,â\\x80\\x9d said David A. Rothery, professor of planetary geosciences at the Open University in Milton Keynes, England. The earthquake was less powerful than many recent deadly quakes. The  .8 earthquake that struck Nepal in April 2015, for instance, killing 8, 000 people, released roughly 250 times more energy. But the Italian quake was very shallow: According to the United States Geological Survey, it occurred about six miles below the surface. â\\x80\\x9cShallow earthquakes cause more destruction than deep earthquakes because the shallowness of the source makes the   at the surface worse,â\\x80\\x9d Professor Rothery said. Video from Amatrice and other towns near the quake center showed heaps of masonry rubble from buildings that had been shaken apart. Earthquakes are set off by the movement of the earthâ\\x80\\x99s crust, which is divided into large sections called tectonic plates. The Apennine Mountains, where the quake occurred on Wednesday, are in an area where one plate, the African, is moving under another, the Eurasian. Because of the complex interaction between the plates, the basin of the Tyrrhenian Sea, off Italyâ\\x80\\x99s west coast, is spreading. It is this spreading, and the tension it creates in the Apennines, that led to the quake. The area of Wednesdayâ\\x80\\x99s temblor experienced significant earthquakes in the past, including one with a magnitude of 6. 3 near the town of Lâ\\x80\\x99Aquila in 2009 that killed at least 295 people, injured more than 1, 000 and left 55, 000 homeless. The two quakes had much in common in terms of genesis and depth,â\\x80\\x9d said Massimo Cocco, a geologist with the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Rome. After the 2009 quake, seven members of a national commission on risk prevention were arrested on charges of failing to adequately warn Lâ\\x80\\x99Aquila about the earthquake risk. They were found guilty of manslaughter in 2012 and sentenced to six years in prison, but they were cleared in 2014 by an appeals court. Mr. Cocco said that Italy had   construction laws for new buildings, but that little has been done to reinforce existing buildings. â\\x80\\x9cResilience is just too low compared to the frequency and the high impact of natural phenomena,â\\x80\\x9d he said.',\n",
       " 'Republicans at the University of North Carolina have gone completely off the rails and are now literally threatening transgender women who use the women s restrooms on campus with the penalty of death.Sadly, there is no amount of exaggeration in that statement. College Republicans have already made direct threats to the life of one transgender female on campus and are asserting that they will defend  their daughters and sisters,  with equal force against anyone else they declare a threat.The student who received the threats posted the exchange to Reddit while redacting her name. College Republicans have completely denied that the exchange occurred, which is not surprising.Portions of the attack, taken from the thread, are listed below: First of (sic), you are a mentally-ill man, no amount of surgery or hormones will change that. Second, if a tranny like you goes into the women s restroom, then what about the rights of them? If you value your life, you shouldn t have made this sick choice and settled with the gender God gave you. Playing into your delusions would make us no better than someone who tolerates pedophiles. You will never be a woman, and so you should stick with the man s room, as that is what you are, a mentally-ill man. you are sick and disgusting for mutilating your own God-given body, so a tranny like you find no pity with us. If you ever dare to set foot into the women s room I will make sure to give you a lesson not to harass our women, you freak of nature. We will make sure that you trannies do not molest our daughters and sisters. This comes on the heels of North Carolina passing a license-to-bigot law, otherwise known as a  religious freedom  law. Among the usual mundane items of people being protected from the sin of baking gay wedding cakes, it also places restrictions on transgender individuals   forcing them to use the bathroom that is associated with their physical genitalia.The UNC College Republicans released a statement denying everything about the incident, claiming that it s a fake story and they never threatened her. Yeah, I m sure that it s far more likely a transgender student decided to make death threats against herself, rather than just simply pee and go on with her business.The law, despite its utter failures on so many levels, seems to have had its desired effect. It has now legitimized every phobia and bit of hate that the good moral Christian right-wingers had inside themselves. They now think that they are within their rights to use deadly force to defend  their women.  Thanks, Republicans. We couldn t have gone full-Christian Sharia in America without you.Featured image via wikicommons',\n",
       " '21st Century Wire says Legacy note to Obama s ghost writer: Barack Hussein Obama will go down in the record books as the greatest gun salesmen of all time. Both Obama and his Attorney General Eric Holder embarked on one of the most aggressive, multi-pronged gun restriction political campaigns in US history. Hence, under President Obama, gun sales sky rocketed   driving up demand along with record levels on purchasing prices.That s right   Obama did more for the gun industry than Charlton Heston ever could.In the aftermath that bull market however, guns, both news and used, have since adopted some of the attributes of a commodity.As the market settles under a new Administration, expect a little more predicability  Josh Levine AZ CentralNow that we re more than a month into the Trump era, I m eager to see how the new administration, controversial legislation, and even heated Twitter exchanges about gun control affects firearm sales in the secondary market.Logic would tell me that sales will slow down. After all, gun sales soared during President Obama s eight years in office. A recent USA Today article I read stated that since Nov. 4, 2008, both Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. and Sturm, Ruger & Co. stock rose more than 1,000 percent. A similar trend was seen during the Clinton Administration as well.On the contrary, a recent Time article stated that gun ownership in the U.S. is the lowest it has been since 1978. Don t believe it? Apparently, the gun sales rose during the past eight years among gun owners buying more guns.Effects on AuctionsSo, how does this all shake out for the auction industry?You have to remember that the secondary market is different than retail. I think bidders will continue to seek out sporting, collectible, recreational and defensive guns at auctions because they know they can find quality firearms at a good value.There s also the matter of trust. Auction houses are FFL holders, and they must adhere to all state and federal laws.So far, it has been business as usual at our auction house, and prices for collectible guns continue to be strong.A 6 inch Colt Python.As an example, recently we sold a Colt Python that realized $3,000 with buyer s premium. They just continue to command top dollar.I m also seeing more Western guns selling at auction. Recently, we sold a Colt Single Action Army that realized $3,120 with buyer s premium. It had condition issues, but still performed well.These examples are Colt. However, other brands are fairing just as well. Browning, Remington, local favorite Ruger and Beretta have all been performing admirably.Even though gun owners and buyers may relax a lot under President Trump s tenure, I m not anticipating a sudden drop of interest in the guns we sell at auction. The Baby Boomers and older are downsizing and selling off their collections. And, no amount of tweets or controversial public policies will change that fact.The buyers may have been motivated by fear when it appeared that Hillary Clinton might win, but now I think they re motivated by pure collecting passion.Tips before purchaseIf you re in the market to purchase antique firearms, check used gun prices in the Blue Book of Gun Values as well as sites like LiveAuctioneers and Gunbrokers.com before placing a bid.Check the gun s condition in person or ask for the auction house to provide photos and a condition report if you are purchasing it online.Also, make sure you will clear a background check as most major auction houses will require a Federal background or NICS check, as it s known.If you re selling, don t despair. I don t think this new Trump era will make prices in the secondary market plummet. They may not be  huge  or  the best,  but I think they ll continue to be decent.Josh Levine owns J.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday delayed voting on a Republican tax overhaul as the bill was tripped up by problems with an amendment sought by fiscal hawks to address a large expansion of the federal budget deficit projected to result from the measure. The Senate debated the legislation late into Thursday and adjourned, putting off any votes until Friday morning. It was unclear if a decisive vote on the bill would occur then. The delay underscored nagging concerns among Republican fiscal conservatives about the deficit impact of the bill. That set up the possibility that its deep tax cuts might have to be moderated, that future tax increases might be built in, and that some conservatives might seek to attach spending cuts, all approaches that could throw up new political problems. White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told reporters in the Capitol: â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think tax cuts are going to be scaled back. I think it would still be historic tax relief for corporations and for middle-income families.â\\x80\\x9d  The tax bill is seen by Republicans as crucial to their prospects in the November 2018 elections, when they will fight to keep control of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump and  Republicans now in control of Congress have yet to pass major legislation, a fact they hope to change with their proposed tax- code overhaul, which would be the biggest since the 1980s. Democrats, expected to unanimously oppose the tax bill, have dismissed it as a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations. Republican Senator Bob Corker and others had tried to add a provision to the bill to trigger automatic future tax increases if the tax cuts in the bill did not boost the economy and generate revenues sufficient to offset the deficit expansion. But the Senate parliamentarian barred Corkerâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9ctriggerâ\\x80\\x9d proposal on procedural grounds. The trigger amendment was needed to win Corkerâ\\x80\\x99s vote and those of others worried about the deficit - worries that intensified when congressional analysts said the bill would not boost the economy enough to offset the estimated deficit expansion, as the Trump administration had said it would. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told reporters in the Capitol that it had not been easy to accommodate Corker, Senator Jeff Flake and other fiscal hawks. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s been pretty hard to make them happy so far. Weâ\\x80\\x99re going to keep working on it ... and weâ\\x80\\x99re going to do it,â\\x80\\x9d Hatch said. Senate Republicans were considering making a proposed corporate income tax rate cut temporary, instead of permanent, so the rate would rise back to an unknown level after six or seven years, said one Republican senator and an aide. By that time, Trump might no longer be in office and a future Congress might change the law. When asked if the tax bill was in trouble, Republican Senator Mike Rounds told reporters: â\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think so. Itâ\\x80\\x99s just a matter of once again trying to make the bill work.â\\x80\\x9d Optimism had reigned earlier in the day, when the bill won the backing of Republican Senator John McCain. Stocks surged on hopes that a key tax overhaul vote was imminent. The S&P 500 hit a record closing high and the Dow Jones industrial average topped the 24,000 mark for the first time. But the Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT, a nonpartisan fiscal analysis unit of Congress, said the bill as passed earlier by the Senate Finance Committee, would generate only $407 billion in new tax revenue from increased economic growth. JCT had earlier estimated the tax bill would balloon the $20 trillion national debt by $1.4 trillion over 10 years. The new estimate, counting â\\x80\\x9cdynamicâ\\x80\\x9d economic effects, put the deficit expansion at $1 trillion, far short of assertions by some Republicans that the tax cuts would pay for themselves. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said the new JCT estimate showed â\\x80\\x9cno amount of dynamic scoring fairy dust will fix the catastrophic deficits of the GOP tax scam.â\\x80\\x9d McCain, a key player in Julyâ\\x80\\x99s collapse of a Republican effort to gut Obamacare, backed the tax bill. While â\\x80\\x9cfar from perfect,â\\x80\\x9d the partyâ\\x80\\x99s 2008 presidential nominee said it would boost the economy and help all Americans. Republican Senator Susan Collins, who also played a role in the failure of the Obamacare rollback, told reporters she was still not committed to the bill. Several Republicans were withholding support while pushing for including a federal deduction for up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes and bigger tax breaks for â\\x80\\x9cpass-throughâ\\x80\\x9d companies, including small businesses. As drafted, the Senate bill would cut the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent after a one-year delay and reduce the tax burden on businesses and individuals, while ending many tax breaks, but would still expand the deficit, Trump wants to enact tax cuts before January. The House approved its own tax bill on Nov. 16. It would have to be merged with the Senate bill, if it is approved, before any final measure could go to Trump for his signature.  Republicans have 52 votes in the 100-member Senate, giving them enough to win if they hold together. With Democrats opposed, Republicans could lose no more than two of their own votes, with Vice President Mike Pence able to break a 50-50 tie. Trump has attacked Corker and Flake on Twitter. Both senators are not seeking re-election. In early October, the president called Corker, â\\x80\\x9cLiddleâ\\x80\\x99 Bob Corkerâ\\x80\\x9d in a tweet. Corker tweeted that the Trump White House was an â\\x80\\x9cadult daycare center.â\\x80\\x9d Days later, he called Trump a liar who had damaged U.S. standing in the world. Trump tweeted back saying Corker â\\x80\\x9ccouldnâ\\x80\\x99t get elected dog catcher.â\\x80\\x9d Trump earlier this month tweeted that Flakeâ\\x80\\x99s political career was â\\x80\\x98toastâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d In a dramatic Senate speech, Flake said U.S. politics had become inured to â\\x80\\x9creckless, outrageous and undignifiedâ\\x80\\x9d behavior from the White House.

       " 'Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s lead in general election polls has faded over the last few weeks. One reason might be that a growing number of Republicans are coalescing around Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s candidacy. Another part of the explanation? Fewer   telephone polls. So far this year,   telephone surveys have tended to show Mrs. Clinton leading by a slightly larger margin than those conducted online. There hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been a   telephone survey since Mr. Trump beat back all his rivals early this month. So Mrs. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s seeming lead has seemed to shrink particularly fast. Why does Mr. Trump do better in online polls? And are the online polls right? The prevailing theory of Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s edge in online surveys is â\\x80\\x9csocial desirability biasâ\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   the idea that poll respondents might be less likely to divulge a socially undesirable opinion, like support for a controversial candidate like Mr. Trump, to a live interviewer than in an online questionnaire. This is not an entirely new phenomenon for Mr. Trump. He fared better in online surveys during the Republican primaries than he did in telephone surveys, a tendency first identified by Jonathan Robinson at Catalist, a data firm associated with the Democratic Party. The pattern lasted all the way through the end of the primary season. The online pollster Morning Consult conducted a study indicating that social desirability bias drove his edge. Thomas Edsall, writing in the The New York Times, raised the possibility that the same phenomenon explains Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s strength in the online polls right now, suggesting that Mr. Trump could outperform traditional surveys showing a wide lead for Mrs. Clinton. Social desirability bias might well be helping Mr. Trump in online polls. But itâ\\x80\\x99s a lot less clear now than it was during the primary season. And even if that is whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on, thereâ\\x80\\x99s no reason to assume the online polls are right. With the primary season effectively over, I think we can say, with some qualifications, that the   surveys were probably more accurate than the online surveys. Why? The actual results just werenâ\\x80\\x99t as good for Mr. Trump as the balance of online surveys predicted they would be. Mr. Trump has now won 41 percent of the popular vote  â\\x80\\x94   including the string of recent contests where he clearly broke through and outperformed his prior vote tallies. On Super Tuesday, he won just 34 percent of the vote  â\\x80\\x94   and he won about 39 percent between then and the New York primary. But the online surveys showed Mr. Trump at 38 percent as early as the new year, broke 40 percent around Super Tuesday, and were in the   by March 15. His actual vote tallies consistently trailed the online surveys. They look a lot more like what the   surveys showed at the time. The Upshot published a series of demographic models throughout the primary season that estimated how Mr. Trump might have fared if the country had voted on that date. At the time, our estimates showed Mr. Trump did not approach 40 percent of the vote until March 15. With the benefit of hindsight, we can do even better: Take all of the results so far, and estimate how Mr. Trump would do in a national primary held at any given stage of the race. These estimates, based on the actual results, consistently match more closely with the live interview surveys than the online ones. This doesnâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily mean that the social desirability bias theory is wrong. Itâ\\x80\\x99s possible that other differences between online and   polls  â\\x80\\x94   likely voter models or sampling procedures  â\\x80\\x94   accounted for Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s additional strength. All told, itâ\\x80\\x99s not enough evidence to make me think that the online polls are more accurate about Mr. Trump than the   surveys. Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s advantage in online polls is a lot less clear in the general election than it was in the primary. It does seem to exist. Mrs. Clinton generally leads Mr. Trump by less in online surveys. On balance, though, Mr. Trump has about 2. 5 more points in   polls. Heâ\\x80\\x99s actually earning a smaller share of the vote in online surveys than in the   polls  â\\x80\\x94   the exact opposite of what one might expect if he were being hurt by social desirability bias in   polls. So whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on? The main difference between the online and   polls is there are vastly more undecided voters in the online surveys. In the   surveys, there are correspondingly more supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, with Mrs. Clinton apparently gaining slightly more ground. Why are there so many undecided voters? Itâ\\x80\\x99s a methodological quirk, relating to the way that online pollsters have to ask questions. Consider, for instance, how the typical NBC   Street Journal poll, a   survey, asked the horse race question in March: â\\x80\\x9cAnd, if the election for president were held today, and Donald Trump were the Republican candidate and Hillary Clinton were the Democratic candidate, for whom would you vote?â\\x80\\x9d Notice that â\\x80\\x9cundecidedâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cotherâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d isnâ\\x80\\x99t a stated option? Live interview pollsters can do that, since the respondent is free to say â\\x80\\x9cotherâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x9d and the interviewer can record it as such. In the   poll, 9 percent volunteered â\\x80\\x9cotherâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cneither,â\\x80\\x9d and 2 percent werenâ\\x80\\x99t sure. But this is a lot more challenging for an online pollster. If you put â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cotherâ\\x80\\x9d as an option, a lot of people are going to take it. But if you donâ\\x80\\x99t include it, you have a problem: What will the truly undecided voters do? They could provide an unreliable answer or leave the survey. If you provide them the option to â\\x80\\x9cskip,â\\x80\\x9d they might skip through the whole questionnaire. In the end, many of the online pollsters give voters the option to choose undecided. Voters are taking it in huge numbers. You can see the effect in another type of NBC News survey: those conducted online by SurveyMonkey. At the beginning of May, the first NBC   general election poll included an explicit â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d option. Mrs. Clinton led, 43 to 37, with 19 percent selecting â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t know. â\\x80\\x9d But in their second survey, conducted after Mr. Trump emerged triumphant, â\\x80\\x9cundecidedâ\\x80\\x9d was no longer an option. Respondents could go out of their way to skip the question and leave it blank, but they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t simply say â\\x80\\x9cundecided. â\\x80\\x9d The result? Mrs. Clinton led, 49 to 44 percent, with just 7 percent electing to skip the question. This doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean there isnâ\\x80\\x99t a social desirability bias against Mr. Trump. One could imagine, for instance, that Mr. Trump would receive notably more support in the online surveys if they had as few undecided voters as the   surveys. But it does make it harder to compare the results of the online and   surveys, since thereâ\\x80\\x99s no way to be sure whether Mr. Trump would still be doing better if there were fewer undecided voters. You could imagine, for instance, that a bunch of Bernie Sandersâ\\x80\\x99s supporters will take the â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x9d option, simply to spare themselves from having to support Mrs. Clinton. In the most recent YouGov online survey, 30 percent of Mr. Sandersâ\\x80\\x99s supporters were selecting either â\\x80\\x9csomeone else,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cnot sureâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t vote. â\\x80\\x9d But in the recent New York   News   survey, just 9 percent wound up in those categories. Mrs. Clinton was the beneficiary: She held 82 percent of Mr. Sandersâ\\x80\\x99s supporters, but just 55 percent in the YouGov poll. (Mr. Trump did fare better among Mr. Sandersâ\\x80\\x99s supporters in the YouGov poll, earning 15 percent of the vote, than in The New York   News poll, where he won 10 percent.) My guess is that Mr. Trump would still fare slightly better in the online surveys than in the   polls, even if the number of undecided voters was equal. Mrs. Clinton tends to lead by a hair more among decided voters, even after removing the â\\x80\\x9cundecidedâ\\x80\\x9d voters. But itâ\\x80\\x99s not clear that itâ\\x80\\x99s a social desirability effect, or that itâ\\x80\\x99s more accurate.',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - As the U.S. presidential campaign heats up, Facebook Inc is going out of its way to show its neutrality - an increasingly urgent matter for the social network as evidence of its power  continues to emerge. Recent studies have shown the site has extraordinary influence. According to research scheduled to be published in August in the Journal of Communication, when people tagged their friends on Facebook in voting reminders, turnout increased by 15 to 24 percent.  During U.S. presidential primary elections this year, a Facebook reminder that informed people when their stateâ\\x80\\x99s voter registration deadline was approaching and provided a link helped produce a surge of nearly 650,000 new voter registrations in California alone, according to Secretary of State Alex Padilla. In the United Kingdom, a Facebook reminder days before the deadline to register to vote on whether the country should exit the European Union led to 186,000 people registering online to vote, according to the government.  â\\x80\\x9cGenerally, getting people out to vote could swing a national election,â\\x80\\x9d said Katherine Haenschen, a PhD student at the University of Texas, Austin and author of the upcoming Journal of Communications study. Facebook is eager to show that its political involvement is limited to seemingly neutral activities such as encouraging voting. The company this week released some of the guidelines that govern its all-important News Feed - the place most people see postings on Facebook - and has pushed back hard against recent allegations of political bias in its â\\x80\\x9cTrending Topicsâ\\x80\\x9d module. At the same time Facebook has embraced its role as a â\\x80\\x9cnew town hallâ\\x80\\x9d for politics, hosting events and helping candidates more effectively leverage their platforms, said Katie Harbath, Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s global politics and government outreach director Her team helps candidates by answering their questions and providing advice, such as how to use Facebook Live and how to increase engagement on their pages.   Still, concerns about Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s role in shaping political attitudes are unlikely to abate anytime soon. Some people object even to voter-registration drives. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, for example, alleged this week that Google and Facebook were trying to encourage a â\\x80\\x9cremainâ\\x80\\x9d vote in Britainâ\\x80\\x99s referendum on European Union membership by encouraging voting, asserting that media users are disproportionately youthful and pro-Europe.    A more common complaint is that Facebook and other social networks serve as an echo chamber of ideas and beliefs, as users decide which people and pages they will follow and customize their News Feed.   A 2015 study in Science showed that Facebook users tended to interact and click on content that was more in line with their ideological views.  Facebook customer Tom Steinberg wrote in a post this week -one that quickly spread over Twitter - that he had actively looked on Facebook for people celebrating Britainâ\\x80\\x99s vote to exit the European Union last week but could not find any.  Steinberg, who said he was in favor of remaining in the European Union, urged tech leaders to do more to address the echo chamber on social media.  â\\x80\\x9cTo not act on this problem now is tantamount to actively supporting and funding the tearing apart of the fabric of our societies,â\\x80\\x9d Steinberg wrote. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re getting countries where one half just doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know anything at all about the other.â\\x80\\x9d  Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management for News Feed, said the team tries to help users find new pages to follow, though he did not cite any specific efforts aimed at encouraging people to diversify their feeds.

       " 'Schumer asked the President not to mention his decision publicly until he could make a formal announcement on Friday.If that s how Obama treats his closest friends who refuse to align with his reckless Iran deal, just think how he treats his enemies President Obama personally leaked news that Senator Chuck Schumer had decided to oppose his Iran deal, even after Schumer personally asked the President not to mention it until he could make an announcement Friday.During last night s widely-viewed GOP debate, word began to circulate that Sen. Schumer had decided to oppose President Obama s nuclear deal with Iran. The leak appeared timed to make sure the high-level Democratic defection Schumer is the 3rd highest ranking Democrat in Congress got as little attention as possible.A story at Politico confirms the leak was in fact timed for minimum impact, but not by Schumer himself. According to an unnamed source familiar with Schumer s decision, the Senator called President Obama Thursday afternoon to say he had decided to oppose the deal. Schumer asked the President not to mention his decision publicly until he could make a formal announcement on Friday. Politico s source was careful to emphasize that Schumer told no one else about his decision, meaning only President Obama himself could have made the decision to leak the story to the press.After word leaked out, Sen. Schumer issued a lengthy statement about his opposition to the deal on his website. The statement breaks his opposition into three parts. He writes that he finds the arguments for the deal over the first 10-years  plausible  but says the inspections regime has  serious weaknesses  and that the snap back of sanctions process is  cumbersome.  In addition, Schumer believes that after 10-years Iran will have a nuclear program approved by the United States. Finally, Schumer considers the non-nuclear parts of the deal and concludes,  When it comes to the non-nuclear aspects of the deal, I think there is a strong case that we are better off without an agreement than with one. Congress is expected to vote against the deal when they return from the August recess. However, that decision can be vetoed by the President. Congress needs a 2/3 vote to override that expected veto. That means the President needs just 34 Senators to take his side. So far he has at least twelve.But as a high ranking Democrat in line to become the next Senate leader of his party, Schumer s defection has the potential to weaken the resolve of other Democrats. Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY) announced his opposition to the deal last night, shortly after word of Schumer s decision broke. For this reason, the White House had urged Schumer to avoid announcing his decision until the very end of the process, or at least after enough Senators had declared themselves to make it a non-issue.The spin coming out of the White House now is that Schumer s defection is a clear signal that a win for their side is inevitable. The thinking goes that an insider like Schumer wouldn t really put Obama s foreign policy legacy at risk, therefore his planned Friday announcement must be a signal that the votes are there to prevent a veto override vote without him. As Politico frames it,  Bad news is being taken as almost good news at the White House. Contradicting this claim is the fact that the White House seemed to be expressing some anger at Schumer earlier in the day. White House spokesman Josh Earnest suggested Friday that Schumer s defection could become an obstacle to his becoming Democratic leader after Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) leaves the Senate. Other White House surrogates made similar noises.Via: Breitbart News',\n",
       " 'Remember when the US had a President who took the lead in the war on terror? Russia has carried out a series of deadly airstrikes against the terrorist group and Vladimir Putin has now sent the country s most elite special forces team into the war zone.And speculation is heightening that offensive will be bolstered by the China s People s Liberation Army, following a number of reports of military movements in the region backed up by strong words from a senior government member at a United Nations meeting.Reports emanating from the Middle East last week said China was planning on joining the fight against ISIS  in the coming weeks , according to a Syrian army official.While Beijing insists it will abide by the United Nations (UN) in the region, hints of an action were backed up when it spoke strongly about a coordinated response to the rising terrorist threat.Speaking of the Syrian crisis China s foreign minister Wang Yi said at the UN Security Council session in New York:  The world cannot afford to stand by and look on with folded arms, but must also not arbitrarily interfere. He added that nations should stand united against  violent extremist ideology .Mr Wang and his opposite number in Russia, Sergey Lavrov met at length last week and afterwards Mr Lavrov said the two countries are in  similar positions  on many domestic and international issues.China has also shown solidarity with Syria, joining Russia in vetoeing UN proposals against Bashar al-Assad, which are likely to prevent him being referred by the council to the International Criminal Court.The latest actions at the UN conference have come amid reports, citing key military sources, Chinese warships have made their way to Syrian shores through the Suez Canal.It was said China s J-15 warplanes would launch from an aircraft carrier for attacks on ISIS.Russian media followed that up by quoting Igor Morozov, a member of the Russian Federation Committee on International Affairs, confirming Chinese aircraft carrier, Lianoning, and a guided missile cruiser were heading to the area, and adding Chinese military advisers were already in the region.Mr Morozov said:  It is known that China has joined our military operation in Syria. The Chinese cruiser has already entered the Mediterranean, followed by its aircraft carrier. These reports have not been verified by China and satellite images show the Syrian port of Tartus, currently empty.However, China come under threat from ISIS in recent months increasing the theory an attack is in the pipeline.

       " 'If Donald Trump wanted people to think he isn t joined at the hip to Russian president Vladimir Putin, this is a strange way to do it. Apparently not satisfied with his own attacks on Hillary Clinton, Trump has now resorted to citing Putin to somehow add extra venom to his catty remarks about the former Democratic presidential nominee.President-elect Donald Trump agreed with Vladimir Putin s assessment of the Hillary Clinton s loss in the 2016 presidential election in a Friday night tweet.The Russian president said Democrats were  losing on all fronts and looking elsewhere for things to blame  and said that the loss  degrades their own dignity,  according to the Washington Post. Outstanding figures in American history from the ranks of the Democratic Party would likely be turning in their graves. Roosevelt certainly would be,  Putin told a group of journalists in Moscow, according to the paper.Putin is celebrating the results of the election going his way, as he has had something of a vendetta against Clinton for years after she opposed him while serving as secretary of state.The double-edged attack comes on the heels of revelations that Putin allegedly directed hackers to go after Clinton, stealing emails from Democratic officials including her campaign chairman John Podesta, later delivering those emails to WikiLeaks who published them for the world to see.Trump has denied that Russia stole the emails, instead arguing that it is unknown who did the hacking. But Trump has actually received intelligence briefings indicating Russian guilt, which he has chosen to ignore in his public statements.The attacks on Clinton also highlight that Trump is still sore about the fact that while he won the election via the Electoral College, he was still the recipient of less raw votes than Clinton. For all time the historical record will show that nearly 3 million more people voted for Clinton over him.Featured image via Flickr',\n",
       " \"  28, 2016 | Reviews   Michael Moore in New York City's Union Square Barnes & Noble to discuss his book Here Comes Trouble , September 13, 2011 ( David Shankbone / CC BY 3.0 ) Michael Mooreâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cTrumplandâ\\x80\\x9d is a textbook illustration of how the mindset of voting for â\\x80\\x9cthe lesser evilâ\\x80\\x9d just results in self-delusionâ\\x80\\x94and ever more evil. \\nM ichael Moore has made some terrific movies in the past, and Where to Invade Next may be the best of them, but I expected Trumpland to be (1) about Trump, (2) funny, (3) honest, (4) at least relatively free of jokes glorifying mass murder. I was wrong on all counts and would like my $4.99 back, Michael. \\nMooreâ\\x80\\x99s new movie is a film of him doing a stand-up comedy show about how wonderfully awesome Hillary Clinton isâ\\x80\\x94except that he mentions Trump a bit at the beginning and heâ\\x80\\x99s dead serious about Clinton being wonderfully awesome. \\nThis film is a text book illustration of why rational arguments for lesser evilist voting do not work. Lesser evilists become self-delusionists. They identify with their lesser evil candidate and delude themselves into adoring the person. Moore is not pushing the â\\x80\\x9cElect her and then hold her accountableâ\\x80\\x9d stuff. He says we have a responsibility to â\\x80\\x9csupport herâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cget behind her,â\\x80\\x9d and that if after two yearsâ\\x80\\x94yes, TWO YEARSâ\\x80\\x94she hasnâ\\x80\\x99t lived up to a platform heâ\\x80\\x99s fantasized for her, well then, never fear, because he, Michael Moore, will run a joke presidential campaign against her for the next two years (this from a guy who backed restricting the length of election campaigns in one of his better works). \\nMoore maintains that virtually all criticism of Hillary Clinton is nonsense. What do we think, he asks, that she asks how many millions of dollars youâ\\x80\\x99ve put into the Clinton Foundation and then she agrees to bomb Yemen for you? Bwahahaha! Pretty funny. Except that Saudi Arabia put over $10 million into the Clinton Foundation, and while she was Secretary of State Boeing put in another $900,000, upon which Hillary Clinton reportedly made it her mission to get the planes sold to Saudi Arabia, despite legal restrictionsâ\\x80\\x94the planes now dropping U.S.-made bombs on Yemen with U.S. guidance, U.S. refueling mid-air, U.S. protection at the United Nations, and U.S. cover in the form of pop-culture distraction and deception from entertainers like Michael Moore. \\nStanding before a giant Air Force missile and enormous photos of Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore claims that substantive criticism of Clinton can consist of only two things, which he dismisses in a flash: her vote for a war on Iraq and her coziness with Wall Street. He says nothing more about what that â\\x80\\x9ccozinessâ\\x80\\x9d consists of, and he claims that sheâ\\x80\\x99s more or less apologized and learned her lesson on Iraq. \\nWhat? It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t one vote. It was numerous votes to start the war, fund it, and escalate it. It was the lies to get it going and keep it going. Itâ\\x80\\x99s all the other wars before and since. She says President Obama was wrong not to launch missile strikes on Syria in 2013. She pushed hard for the overthrow of Qadaffi in 2011. She supported the coup government in Honduras in 2009. She has backed escalation and prolongation of war in Afghanistan. She skillfully promoted the White House justification for the war on Iraq. She does not hesitate to back the use of drones for targeted killing. She has consistently backed the military initiatives of Israel. She was not ashamed to laugh at the killing of Qadaffi. She has not hesitated to warn that she could obliterate Iran. She is eager to antagonize Russia. She helped facilitate a military coup in Ukraine. She has the financial support of the arms makers and many of their foreign customers. She waived restrictions at the State Department on selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Qatar, all states wise enough to donate to the Clinton Foundation. She supported President Bill Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s wars and the power of the president to make war without Congress. She has advocated for arming fighters in Syria and for a â\\x80\\x9cNo Flyâ\\x80\\x9d zone. She supported a surge in Iraq even before President Bush did. \\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s just her war problem. What about her banking problem, prison problem, fracking problem, corporate trade problem, corporate healthcare problem, climate change problem, labor problem, Social Security problem, etc.? \\nMoore parts company from substantive critique in order to lament unproven rightwing claims that Hillary Clinton has murdered various people. â\\x80\\x9cI hope she did,â\\x80\\x9d screams Moore. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s who I want as Commander in Chief!â\\x80\\x9d Hee hee hee. \\nThen Moore shamelessly pushes the myth that Hillary tried to create single-payer, or at least â\\x80\\x9cuniversalâ\\x80\\x9d healthcare (whatever that is) in the 1990s. In fact, as I heard Paul Wellstone tell it, single-payer easily won the support of Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s focus group, but she buried it for her corporate pals and produced the phonebook-size monstrosity that was dead on arrival but reborn in another form years later as Obamacare. She killed single-payer then, has not supported it since, and does not propose it now. (Well, she does admit in private that itâ\\x80\\x99s the only thing that works, as her husband essentially blurts out in public.) But Moore claims that because we didnâ\\x80\\x99t create â\\x80\\x9cuniversalâ\\x80\\x9d healthcare in the 1990s we all have the blood of millions on our hands, millions whom Hillary would have saved had we let her. \\nMoore openly fantasizes: what would it be like if Hillary Clinton is secretly progressive? Remember that Moore and many others did the exact same thing with Obama eight years ago. To prove Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s progressiveness Moore plays an audio clip of her giving a speech at age 22 in which she does not hint at any position on any issue whatsoever. \\nMostly, however, Moore informs us that Hillary Clinton is female. He anticipates â\\x80\\x9cthat glorious moment when the other gender has a chance to run this world and kick some righteous ass.â\\x80\\x9d Now tell me please, dear world, if your ass is kicked by killers working for a female president will you feel better about it? How do you like Mooreâ\\x80\\x99s inclusive comments throughout his performance: â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re all Americans, right?â\\x80\\x9d \\nMooreâ\\x80\\x99s fantasy is that Clinton will dash off a giant pile of executive orders, just writing Congress out of the governmentâ\\x80\\x94executive orders doing things like releasing all nonviolent drug offenders from prison immediately (something the real Hillary Clinton would oppose in every way she could). \\nBut when he runs for president, Moore says, heâ\\x80\\x99ll give everybody free drugs. \\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you the Clinton ad Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to see. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s standing over a stove holding an egg. â\\x80\\x9cThis is your brain,â\\x80\\x9d she says solemnly, cracking it into the pan with a sizzle. â\\x80\\x9cThis is your brain on partisanship.â\\x80\\x9d \\n \",\n",
       " '(Reuters) - Helen Delich Bentley, a former journalist and a U.S. Republican congresswoman from Maryland who gained global attention by smashing Japanese goods to protest Tokyoâ\\x80\\x99s trade policies, died over the weekend at the age of 92, officials said. Bentley upset a longtime Democratic congressman to win a U.S. House of Representatives seat in 1984, a year in which Ronald Reaganâ\\x80\\x99s landslide victory in the presidential race helped bring several new faces from the party to Congress. The five-term congresswoman was a staunch advocate for the port of Baltimore and the stateâ\\x80\\x99s maritime industry. After reports that Japanese company Toshiba had sold technology to the Soviet Union to help their submarines sail more quietly, she led other members of Congress who used a sledgehammer to smash Japanese-made goods on the Capitol steps. The event came as tensions were running high with Tokyo over a widening U.S. trade deficit with the country.  She left Congress to run for governor of Maryland but lost in the partyâ\\x80\\x99s primary. â\\x80\\x9cCongresswoman Bentley worked with tenacity, energy, and passion on behalf of her constituents, making her a rare breed in politics and a role model to public servants across Maryland,â\\x80\\x9d current Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, wrote in a Facebook post. Bentley was born in 1923 in Nevada and her parents were immigrants from Yugoslavia. After earning a bachelorâ\\x80\\x99s degree in journalism, she found a job with the Baltimore Sun, beginning a three-decade long relationship with the newspaper in which she wrote ground-breaking stories on the maritime industry and labor, according to her congressional biography. She died on Saturday at her home in Timonium, a Baltimore suburb, the Baltimore Sun reported, adding Bentley had been diagnosed with brain cancer. ',\n",

       " 'SITTWE, Myanmar (Reuters) - Myanmar s army chief called on Thursday for people internally displaced by violence in Rakhine State to go home and rebuild communities, but he made no mention of 422,000 Rohingya Muslims who fled to Bangladesh to escape his force s operations. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, in a major speech on his plans for Rakhine state on his first visit there since the latest strife erupted, said the military had handled the situation as best as it could after a wave of coordinated attacks by Rohingya insurgents on Aug. 25. The United Nations has said the military response to the insurgent attacks is ethnic cleansing aimed at pushing the Rohingya Muslim community out of Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Myanmar denies that, saying its forces are waging a legitimate campaign against Muslim terrorists who have been attacking and torching villages of Buddhists and other non-Muslims, some 30,000 of whom were internally displaced. Min Aung Hlaing did not mention the accusation of ethnic cleansing in his speech to business people, officials and some of the displaced, in Sittwe, the state capital.  Regarding the rehabilitation of villages of our national races, for the national races who fled their homes, first of all they must go back to their places,  he said.  National races  is a Myanmar term referring to members of officially recognized indigenous ethnic groups who make up the diverse nation. The Rohingya are not recognized as a  national race , and are instead seen as illegal immigrants and denied citizenship. Animosity between Buddhists in Rakhine state and the Rohingya goes back generations, but has seethed in recent years, fueled in part by a surge of Buddhist nationalism since nearly five decades of strict military rule came to an end.  The important thing is to have our people in the region. It s necessary to have control of our region with our national races,  Min Aung Hlaing said.  We can t do anything if there are no people from our national races ... that is their rightful place.  Min Aung Hlaing did not refer to the return of Muslims to their villages in the north of the state, almost half of which have been abandoned and torched. The crisis has drawn international condemnation and calls from the United Nations and U.S. President Donald Trump for the military to stop the violence and support diplomatic efforts for a long-term solution for the Rohingya. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, in her first address to the nation on the crisis on Tuesday, said Myanmar was ready to start a verification process to take back refugees, under a 1993 arrangement with Bangladesh.  Refugees from this country will be accepted without any problem,  she said. Min Aung Hlaing did not mention the return of refugees from Bangladesh.    ',\n",

Such thinking is an insult to rosÃ©, and to consumers, though a boon for cynical producers, who may take it as a free pass to make bad rosÃ©. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll have no trouble finding plenty of that. At Wine School, we always try to separate common sense from nonsense. With rosÃ©, that begins by ignoring efforts to diminish expectations. Educated consumers should demand more from a wine than   labels or celebrity  . Such marketing may well have contributed to rosÃ©â\\x80\\x99s skyrocketing seasonal popularity, but weâ\\x80\\x99re more interested in which wines we like, which ones we donâ\\x80\\x99t, and why. As many bad rosÃ©s as you may find  â\\x80\\x94   manufactured industrially to create precisely the right shade of pink and just the right fruit aromas, with maybe a little sweetness for the   lovers  â\\x80\\x94   good rosÃ©s abound, too. These are likely to be bone dry, though not always. They will be balanced with aromas, flavors and colors arrived at naturally, without manipulation on the assembly line. For the last month, we have been focusing on rosÃ©s from Provence, the region historically associated with rosÃ© and the pastoral images it conjures. While good rosÃ©s can be found from almost every wine region in the world, we are dealing with fundamentals, so Provence seemed a good place to start. As usual, I recommended three wines and invited readers to drink them and share their thoughts by commenting at nytimes. . The three bottles I selected were: Commanderie de Peyrassol CÃ´tes de Provence RosÃ© 2015, Mas de Gourgonnier Les Baux de Provence RosÃ© 2015 and ChÃ¢teau de Pibarnon Bandol RosÃ© 2015. Not surprisingly, these are very young wines. Almost all the rosÃ© sold each summer is from the most recent vintage. Consumers, for really no particularly good reason, demand it, so producers rush their bottles to market in May. As a result, the vast majority of rosÃ©s are made to drink immediately. They are easy, ephemeral, and by the time Labor Day rolls around and wine shops are slashing prices, they are already on their way down. But the most serious rosÃ©s will benefit from a little more bottle age. If you see good Bandol rosÃ©s from 2014 or even earlier, or bottles from other top ProvenÃ§al producers like Clos Cibonne or ChÃ¢teau Simone, try them. They are likely to be more expensive than the easier rosÃ©s, but you may be surprised at the complexity that has developed. I would have wanted to pick older rosÃ©s just for fun, but frankly, they are not widely enough available for our purposes. So the 2015s were the choice. The Mas de Gourgonnier, made primarily of grenache but with small amounts of cabernet sauvignon, cinsault, syrah and mourvÃ¨dre, was the   tasting of wildflowers, red berries and citrus. It could have been the proverbial   wine: light, lively and fresh. The Commanderie de Peyrassol had a little more going on. Itâ\\x80\\x99s made of cinsault, grenache and syrah in proportions that depend on the vintage, and I found it long, deep and earthy, with flavors of lime, anise and hot rocks. That underlying mineral edge made it especially delicious. Yet it, too, was fresh and lively and could fill that poolside role well. The Pibarnon, by contrast, seemed bigger, maybe a little too big for the pool party. It was made mostly of mourvÃ¨dre, with the remainder cinsault, and it was deeper and more complex than the other two. I usually love Bandol rosÃ©s for their savory chalk and licorice flavors, but this one had an added touch of what seemed to me ripe tropical fruit. Sniffing the wine, it seemed intrusive, though I enjoyed the fruit and gravelly flavors on the palate. Each of these wines went beautifully, I thought, with a dish of wild salmon with garlic butter, from an exceptional and easy recipe by my colleague Melissa Clark. Anchovies and garlic are signature ProvenÃ§al flavors, and perhaps that accounts for why the dish and the wines seemed such a triumphantly delicious pairing. Not everybody found the rosÃ©s to be as versatile with food as their reputation suggests. Jane Montgomery of Washington, D. C. reported that she loved drinking a Whispering Angel rosÃ© from ChÃ¢teau dâ\\x80\\x99Esclans. â\\x80\\x9cIt was crisp and airy and tasted like youâ\\x80\\x99d just licked a rocky outcropping along the beach,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cInterestingly, it was also the least successful wine pairing experience Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever had. â\\x80\\x9d She said that the wine didnâ\\x80\\x99t clash with her meal of grilled kebabs and fattoush, but that it added nothing, and she wondered whether all rosÃ©s from the region were similarly lacking in versatility. I understand her frustration. A synergy of food, wine and conversation is always my goal at a meal. Iâ\\x80\\x99m at a loss to explain the failure of this pairing, though. It seemed to me to be a good one. Other readers reported mixed results. Ferguson of Princeton, N. J. who found all three rosÃ© selections, said that a pairing with winter squash risotto was a dud but that the wines were wonderful with a pizza with anchovies, olives and caramelized onions. Not unexpected. As Ferguson noted, salty foods are very good with ProvenÃ§al rosÃ©s. On the other hand, Brian Hall of Highland Park, Ill. likened rosÃ© to a   utility player in baseball because of its versatility, and suggested that this quality allowed rosÃ© to be enjoyed   rather than just in the summer. Jammer in Vermont has also become a   rosÃ© drinker, and offered an enticing, if novel image: â\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing as lovely as having a rustic lamb dinner on a snowy New England winter night accompanied by a lovely   Bandol from Provence. â\\x80\\x9d Iâ\\x80\\x99ve long been in favor of freeing rosÃ© from its summer confinement. Serious rosÃ©s transcend the   imagery of marketers, as Jammer suggests, and despite some of the pairing failures, I still believe rosÃ© can complement a variety of foods that people want to eat  . One reader had a particularly innovative idea for rosÃ©. VSB, to honor the 13th anniversary of wiping out   debt, created a Freedom Pink cocktail. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not usually one to add anything to wine, but this seemed intriguing. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s the recipe: â\\x80\\x9cMuddle 2 sliced strawberries and 8 raspberries in the bottom of a pint glass. Add 6 ounces of the Peyrassol or other rosÃ©. Fill with seltzer, stir gently to float the fruit, add a few ice cubes. Garnish with a sprig of mint. â\\x80\\x9d Now thatâ\\x80\\x99s versatility.',\n",
       " 'BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans in liberal enclaves from New York to San Francisco reacted with shock and despair on Wednesday to Republican businessman Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton, with many struggling to explain the result to their children. Trump, who had never before run for public office, won on a broad wave of support both from the Republican U.S. heartland and by flipping previously Democratic states, including Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio, helping his party protect majorities in both chambers of Congress. The victory stunned residents of major cities up and down the East and West coasts, many of whom had trusted opinion polls that had long predicted a Clinton victory but were proven profoundly wrong by Tuesdayâ\\x80\\x99s results. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m feeling physical pain. Iâ\\x80\\x99m shocked. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sad,â\\x80\\x9d said Sofia Huizar, 30, as she waited outside the Manhattan hotel where Clinton conceded her loss on Wednesday morning, some eight hours after Trump declared victory. Huizar, a U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico, said she spent much of Tuesday night commiserating with family across the border. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a way to help process the fear,â\\x80\\x9d Huizar said. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign promises have included building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal crossings and to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Others, like Kim Priban, a 38-year-old nurse who lives in the Cleveland suburb of Boston Heights, Ohio, said they had a difficult time breaking the news to their children.  Priban said she had proudly taken her 5-year-old daughter along to vote for Clinton, who would have been the first woman U.S. president, and on Wednesday morning had to discuss the result with her. â\\x80\\x9cI still havenâ\\x80\\x99t quite figured out what to tell my daughter. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been crying all day,â\\x80\\x9d Priban said. â\\x80\\x9cI feel like I have to go out and make my voice heard for women and children.â\\x80\\x9d Priban and Huizar are likely far from alone in the depth of their pain over Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s loss, academic research suggests. A 2015 paper by researchers at Harvard University found that voters who supported Republican Mitt Romneyâ\\x80\\x99s unsuccessful White House bid reported sharper spikes in their unhappiness than parents following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre of Connecticut schoolchildren or Boston residents after the deadly 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. While many Democrats along the coasts mourned Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s defeat, Trump supporters celebrated the outcome, saying they hoped he would shake up a dysfunctional political system. â\\x80\\x9cThe overwhelming majority of Americans want change, and this is a direct result. ... Trump is the disrupter, for better or for worse,â\\x80\\x9d said Kelley Smith, 33, who lives in Chicago and works in software sales. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s a little bombastic. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think heâ\\x80\\x99s polished. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t think heâ\\x80\\x99s going to purposefully take our country down.â\\x80\\x9d The divide between the coasts and the heartland, evident not only in the results but also in the social media battles ahead of the election, made the Trump victory more shocking for liberals. Deena Pioli, an attorney from San Francisco, said she had rarely run into people who were not supporting Clinton, and that she now regrets that. â\\x80\\x9cThose of us here in San Francisco and California should not be so safe in our bubble,â\\x80\\x9d she said.   Trump dropped his angry speaking style to take a conciliatory tone when he declared victory early Wednesday morning, saying, â\\x80\\x9cI pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.â\\x80\\x9d Clinton and Democratic President Barack Obama sounded similarly restrained. But the breadth of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s win left his opponents urging self-examination. â\\x80\\x9cFolks should have deep humility in this moment,â\\x80\\x9d said civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson on Twitter. â\\x80\\x9cWe all have things to learn from how Trump happened.â\\x80\\x9d Karen Parnett, a 48-year-old mother of three in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said she had been heartbroken to tell her children about Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s win, and said the result illustrated the growing anger of lower-income voters who believe their concerns are being ignored by Washington. â\\x80\\x9cI have too much at stake with three kids to just throw up my hands and weep and say that all is lost,â\\x80\\x9d Parnett said. â\\x80\\x9cThere are new realities and we need as a country to reckon with what in the world we are going to do about the disenfranchisement of the white working poor.â\\x80\\x9d (This story has been refiled to fix typo in ninth paragraph) ',\n",

       " 'The Obama administration spent more than $77 million to promote Obamacare in 2016, the New York Post reported. [Contracts obtained by the Post show that the federal government had a contract with   PR firm Weber Shandwick, where the government paid the firm $74. 15 million on July 28, 2016, and an additional $3. 69 million on September 9, 2016, to promote the plan.  Of that money, $64 million went to radio, television, and digital  $4 million went to creative development and production $5 million to direct response marketing $2 million to campaign strategy $1 million to branding and $1. 5 million to encourage small business enrollment. An official from the Trump administration dismissed the efforts of the Obama administration to make a   effort to boost enrollment. â\\x80\\x9cTens of millions in   taxpayer funds spent on TV ads wonâ\\x80\\x99t sell a fundamentally flawed approach to health care,â\\x80\\x9d the official told the Post. Pam Jenkins, president of Weber Shandwick, signed the contract. Obama selected the firmâ\\x80\\x99s chairman, Jack Leslie, to be chairman of the U. S. African Development Foundation. Leslie donated $1, 000 to former President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s 2012   campaign and $2, 700 to Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s failed presidential bid.

       " 'WASHINGTON  â\\x80\\x94   As he confronted a series of international challenges from the Middle East to Asia last week, President Trump made certain that nothing was certain about his foreign policy. To the extent that a Trump Doctrine is emerging, it seems to be this: donâ\\x80\\x99t get roped in by doctrine. In a week in which he hosted foreign heads of state and launched a cruise missile strike against Syriaâ\\x80\\x99s government, Mr. Trump dispensed with his own dogma and forced other world leaders to   their assumptions about how the United States will lead in this new era. He demonstrated a highly improvisational and situational approach that could inject a risky unpredictability into relations with potential antagonists, but he also opened the door to a more traditional American engagement with the world that eases alliesâ\\x80\\x99 fears. As a private citizen and candidate, Mr. Trump spent years arguing that Syriaâ\\x80\\x99s civil war was not Americaâ\\x80\\x99s problem, that Russia should be a friend, and that China was an â\\x80\\x9cenemyâ\\x80\\x9d whose leaders should not be invited to dinner. As president, Mr. Trump, in the space of just days, involved America more directly in the Syrian morass than ever before, opened a new acrimonious rift with Russia, and invited Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s leader for a largely convivial, letâ\\x80\\x99   dinner at his Florida estate. In the process, Mr. Trump upended domestic politics as well. He rejected the nationalist wing of his own White House, led by Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, who opposes entanglement in Middle East conflicts beyond fighting terrorism and favors punitive trade measures against Beijing. And Mr. Trump, by launching the strike on Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s ally Syria, undercut critics who have portrayed him as a Manchurian candidate doing the bidding of President Vladimir V. Putin after the Kremlin intervened in last yearâ\\x80\\x99s election on his behalf. Given his unpredictability, none of this means that Mr. Trump has pivoted permanently in any of these areas. The White House has prepared an executive order that the president may sign in the coming days targeting countries like China that dump steel in the American market. And Mr. Trump is sending Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson on Tuesday to Moscow, where he will have the additional task of trying to smooth over the rancor of recent days, in addition to exploring whether Russia could be a real partner in battling the Islamic State in Syria. Moreover, the missile strike, in response to a chemical weapons attack, was intended to be a limited,   operation, and the president seemed determined to quickly move on. After announcing the attack Thursday evening, he made no mention of it Friday during public appearances, nor on Saturday during his weekly address. As of Saturday afternoon, the   president had not even taunted President Bashar   of Syria online, although he did thank the American troops who carried out the missile strike and defended the decision not to target the runway at the air base that was hit. â\\x80\\x9cOur decisions,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump said in the Saturday address, â\\x80\\x9cwill be guided by our values and our goals  â\\x80\\x94   and we will reject the path of inflexible ideology that too often leads to unintended consequences. â\\x80\\x9d That concept, flexibility, seems key to understanding Mr. Trump. He hates to be boxed in, as he mused in the Rose Garden last week while contemplating the first new military operation of his presidency with geopolitical consequences. â\\x80\\x9cI like to think of myself as a very flexible person,â\\x80\\x9d he told reporters. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t have to have one specific way. â\\x80\\x9d He made clear he cherished unpredictability. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t like to say where Iâ\\x80\\x99m going and what Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing,â\\x80\\x9d he said. That flexibility was a hallmark of his rise in real estate, and if critics preferred the word erratic, it did not bother Mr. Trump  â\\x80\\x94   it has since worked well enough to vault him to the White House. But now that he is commander in chief of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s most powerful nation, leaders around the world are trying to detect a method to the man. â\\x80\\x9cThere is no emerging doctrine for Trump foreign policy in a classical sense,â\\x80\\x9d said Kathleen H. Hicks, a former Pentagon official who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. â\\x80\\x9cThere are, however, clear emerging characteristics consistent with the attributes of the man himself: unpredictable, instinctual and undisciplined. â\\x80\\x9d On Syria, Mr. Trump had mocked President Barack Obama for setting a â\\x80\\x9cred lineâ\\x80\\x9d against the use of chemical weapons and urged him not to launch a punitive strike against Syria after Mr. Assad crossed it in 2013. That attack, with a death toll of 1, 400, dwarfed last weekâ\\x80\\x99s toll of 84. And just days before last weekâ\\x80\\x99s attack, Mr. Tillerson indicated that Washington would accept Mr. Assadâ\\x80\\x99s remaining in power. Indeed, critics, including Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, argued that Mr. Assad felt free to launch a chemical attack precisely because Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s administration had given him a green light. Russia, critics added, did not constrain Mr. Assad because it has had a blank check from an overly friendly Trump administration. And Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s efforts to bar Syrian refugees from the United States, they said, sent a signal that he did not care about them. â\\x80\\x9cPresident Trump seems not to have thought through any of this, or have any kind of broader strategy, but rather to have launched a military strike based on a sudden, emotional decision,â\\x80\\x9d Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote in an article for The Huffington Post on Saturday. Mr. Assad is not the only leader testing Mr. Trump. North Korea has   missile after missile in recent weeks, almost as if trying to get Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s attention. So far, he has been measured in his response, urging President Xi Jinping of China during his visit to do more to rein in North Korea. But national security aides have also prepared options for Mr. Trump if China does not take a more assertive stance, including reintroducing nuclear weapons in South Korea. Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s action in Syria was welcomed by many traditional American allies who had fretted over Mr. Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s reluctance to take a greater leadership role in the Middle East, and feared that Mr. Trump would withdraw even more. After the missile strike, Israeli news outlets were filled with headlines like â\\x80\\x9cThe Americans Are Back,â\\x80\\x9d and European leaders expressed relief both that he had taken action and that he had not gone too far. â\\x80\\x9cWe have learned that Trump is not so isolationist as many Europeans feared he would be  â\\x80\\x94   he appears to care about victims of a gas attack in Syria,â\\x80\\x9d said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform in London. â\\x80\\x9cWe have learned that he understands that U. S. influence had suffered from the perception  â\\x80\\x94   which grew under Obama  â\\x80\\x94   that it was a power weakened by its reluctance to use force. â\\x80\\x9d That touches on another animating factor as Mr. Trump deals with foreign challenges  â\\x80\\x94   doing the opposite of whatever Mr. Obama did. Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s first instinct after the Syrian chemical attack was to blame Mr. Obama for not enforcing his red line, never mind that Mr. Trump had urged him not to at the time. Even as he announced the missile strike on Thursday night, Mr. Trump asserted that his predecessorâ\\x80\\x99s handling of Syria had â\\x80\\x9cfailed very dramatically. â\\x80\\x9d Intentionally or not, though, Mr. Trump adopted language similar to that used by Mr. Obama and many other presidents in defining American priorities. While in the past Mr. Trump said the United States did not have a national interest in Syria, last week he said instability there was â\\x80\\x9cthreatening the United States and its allies. â\\x80\\x9d He also said that â\\x80\\x9cAmerica stands for justice,â\\x80\\x9d effectively espousing a responsibility to act in cases of human rights abuses, as other presidents have at times. Until now, Mr. Trump has largely eschewed such language. Just three days earlier, he had hosted Egyptâ\\x80\\x99s authoritarian president, Abdel Fattah   and made no public mention of the thousands of people the Cairo government has imprisoned in a political crackdown. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is striking to me is a subtle yet clear shift away from the rhetoric of pure American   narrowly defined, as espoused by candidate Donald Trump,â\\x80\\x9d said Robert Danin, a former Middle East negotiator who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations. â\\x80\\x9cWhat has emerged is a new language of American leadership in the world that we have not heard before from President Trump. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Grant and others noted that the strike, coming as Mr. Trump shared a meal with Mr. Xi, could resonate in Asia as well, leaving North Korea to wonder whether the president might resort to force to stop its development of ballistic missiles. But Ms. Hicks said Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s flexibility  â\\x80\\x94   or unpredictability  â\\x80\\x94   was itself â\\x80\\x9cextremely risky. â\\x80\\x9d If other countries cannot accurately predict what an American president will do, she said, they may act precipitously, citing the example of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s extending its maritime claims in the South China Sea. â\\x80\\x9cImagine if Donald Trump then took exception in ways they didnâ\\x80\\x99t anticipate and major wars ensued,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cBright lines, derived from clear interests and enforced well, are generally best, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t think Donald Trump likes to be constrained by bright lines. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court in New York on Tuesday revived part of a $1.68 billion lawsuit against Iran s central bank, Bank Markazi, by families of soldiers killed in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Lebanon. By a 3-0 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a lower court judge erred in dismissing claims against Markazi; Banca UBAE SpA, an Italian bank accused of engaging in transactions for Iran; and Clearstream Banking SA, a Luxembourg bank accused of opening accounts for Markazi and UBAE. It upheld the dismissal of claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co. The plaintiffs sought to recoup bond proceeds allegedly owned by Markazi and held by Clearstream, to partially satisfy $3.8 billion of judgments they had won against Iran after a federal court deemed them victims of state-sponsored terrorism. They accused the banks of fraudulently processing billions of dollars of bond proceeds owed to Markazi, and targeted cash held in a Clearstream account at JPMorgan in New York. Iran is one of several countries and organizations ordered by U.S. courts to pay damages to terrorism victims. Such orders are often difficult to enforce. Lawyers for the plaintiffs and banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest had dismissed the case in February 2015. She said she lacked jurisdiction over Markazi assets located abroad, the plaintiffs had released claims against Clearstream and UBAE, and nothing was left in the Clearstream account for JPMorgan to  turn over.  In Tuesday s 72-page decision, Circuit Judge Robert Sack said Forrest reasonably assumed she lacked jurisdiction because the main assets in dispute had been recorded on Clearstream s books in Luxembourg. But he said recent court rulings interpreting the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act permitted courts in New York  to exercise jurisdiction  to recall to New York extraterritorial assets owned by a foreign sovereign.  Sack ordered Forrest to decide whether she has personal jurisdiction over Clearstream, and whether state or federal law prevents the plaintiffs from recovering bond proceeds. In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court said in a separate case that Markazi must pay nearly $2 billion, which had been frozen, to terrorism victims, and Congress had not exceeded its authority by passing a law making it easier to recover damages. The 1983 attack, in Beirut, killed 241 U.S. service members. The case is Peterson et al v Islamic Republic of Iran et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-0690. ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump is stacking his trade transition team with veterans of the U.S. steel industryâ\\x80\\x99s battles with China, signaling a potentially more aggressive approach to U.S. complaints of unfair Chinese subsidies for its exports and barriers to imports. Led by Wilbur Ross, a billionaire steel investor and Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s nominee for commerce secretary, Dan DiMicco, the former CEO of steelmaker Nucor Corp, and three veteran steel trade lawyers, the team is expected to help shift the U.S. trade focus more heavily toward enforcement actions aimed at bringing down a chronic U.S. trade deficit, Washington trade experts said.     Based on their past efforts, this could include more challenges to Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s trade practices through the World Trade Organization and more U.S. government-initiated anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against a wider range of Chinese products. The latter would be argued before the U.S. International Trade Commission - a forum where the steel industry has had considerable success. Ross, DiMicco and other leaders of Big Steel have been on the front-line in U.S. trade battles against the worldâ\\x80\\x99s export superpower. Hit by a flood of cheap imports from China and other countries, the U.S. steel industry has brought 16 new cases in the past three years, seeking punitive duties from the Commerce Department to combat below-cost dumping and unfair subsidies that slashed prices of various steel products to historic lows last year, causing layoffs at U.S. steel mills. (See graphic tmsnrt.rs/2gUFGAf) Some of these cases have resulted in massive penalties against Chinese imports, including duties of more than 500 percent on Chinese cold-rolled steel used in autos and appliances.    Lawyers Robert Lighthizer and Jeffrey Gerrish have represented United States Steel and Stephen Vaughn has represented AK Steel in these cases. The three are also part of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s trade team. Lighthizer, Gerrish, Vaughn, Ross and DiMicco either declined to comment for this story or did not respond to Reutersâ\\x80\\x99 requests for interviews. Trade experts familiar with their views and their history of confrontation with China, however, say they will not be afraid to push the limits of what is legal under World Trade Organization rules in defense of U.S. trade interests.   Lighthizer, who along with DiMicco is considered a strong candidate to be the new U.S. Trade Representative, is known for his work during the Reagan administration pressuring Japan into voluntary export restraints.  â\\x80\\x9cBob Lighthizer is very smart, very strategic and totally fearless,â\\x80\\x9d said a Washington attorney who has worked with him for three decades and asked not to be named because Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s USTR selection process was still under way. â\\x80\\x9cIf heâ\\x80\\x99s in charge you can expect him to use every tool available to create leverage to get China and anyone else to stop the cheating. He is no fan of the WTO.â\\x80\\x9d Lighthizer told a congressional panel in 2010 that the WTOâ\\x80\\x99s dispute resolution system was ineffective and that the United States â\\x80\\x9cshould consider aggressive interpretations of WTO provisions that might help us deal with Chinese mercantilism.â\\x80\\x9d Such tactics could include imposing temporary import quotas and surcharges and factoring in the effect of currency manipulation into U.S. anti-dumping duties, he said. Ross, who advised Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s presidential campaign on economic issues, has signaled he will use access to the lucrative U.S. consumer market as leverage to negotiate better trade terms. The United States is Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s biggest export market. During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to levy a punitive 45-percent tariff on Chinese goods and label Beijing a currency manipulator. It is not clear though whether he will follow through on those threats once he takes office. Ross told CNN last week that Trump will not be â\\x80\\x9cwilly nilly slapping a 45 percent tariff on everything,â\\x80\\x9d but will maintain the threat of tariffs as part of negotiations. In an emailed statement to Reuters, Ross said he would divest â\\x80\\x9call holdings and board seats that pose conflictsâ\\x80\\x9d but declined to answer other questions on his plans for Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s trade policy and engagement with China.  The personal blog of DiMicco, meanwhile, gives some indication of how he would approach China if he was named head of USTR. He has accused China of waging a â\\x80\\x9cmercantilist trade warâ\\x80\\x9d on the United States for two decades, through currency manipulation, unfair subsidies and intellectual property theft. On the issue of currency manipulation, many economists disagree, saying Beijing is no longer keeping its yuan artificially undervalued to make its exports cheap, citing the hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves it has spent to prop up the yuanâ\\x80\\x99s value this year. A key question for Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s trade team is how far they can push China to change its trade practices without provoking a trade war that will hurt both countries. â\\x80\\x9cIf what they plan to do is get a little scratchier with China on enforcement within the existing WTO rules, thatâ\\x80\\x99s OK,â\\x80\\x9d said Scott Miller, a China trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. â\\x80\\x9cBut if they go outside those guardrails, it will be unpleasant because that will draw retaliation.â\\x80\\x9d  He Weiwen, vice president at the Center for China and Globalization, a government-affiliated think-tank in Beijing, said any punitive action against China by the Trump administration would invite a retaliatory response. â\\x80\\x9cWe will certainly respond in the same way,â\\x80\\x9d he said, adding that Washington and Beijing â\\x80\\x9cshould find good solutions that are acceptable to both and not go to extremes. It will hurt both.â\\x80\\x9d Chinese state media have warned that any new tariffs imposed by Trump would lead to retaliation against Boeing aircraft, Apple iPhones and U.S. corn and soybeans. ',\n",

       " 'MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday asked Congress to extend martial law on the southern island of Mindanao for a year, arguing that Islamist militants have been regrouping since a five-month urban conflict ended there in October. He said fighters who survived the battle for Marawi City were determined to establish a Southeast Asian  wilayat    or governorate - for Islamic State and named militant Abu Turaifie as potentially the radical group s next regional  emir . The previous  emir , Isnilon Hapilon, and another rebel commander loyal to Islamic State were killed in October as the military closed in on fighters who had occupied the heart of Marawi since May 23. More than 1,100 people - mostly militants - were killed and 350,000 displaced by the Marawi unrest. In his letter to the Senate and House of Representatives, Duterte said militants were radicalizing and recruiting local people, reorganizing themselves and building their finances.  These activities are geared towards the conduct of intensified atrocities and armed public uprisings,  he said, adding that they were aimed at establishing a global Islamic caliphate and a  wilayat , not only in the Philippines but the whole of Southeast Asia.  A group led by Turaifie - who heads a splinter group of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters and, according to Duterte, is  said to be Hapilon s potential successor  - was planning bombings in the Cotabato province south of Marawi. Intelligence reports indicate that militants are plotting to attack another city, Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said on Monday. Duterte placed restive Mindanao, which has a population of 22 million, under military rule after the attack on Marawi, and martial law was due to be lifted there on Dec. 31.  Lawmakers will vote on his request for a one-year extension at a joint session on Wednesday, Congress majority leader Rodolfo Farinas told reporters. Continuing martial law beyond the initial 60-day limit requires lawmakers  approval, but the constitution does not limit any extensions. Martial law allows for tougher surveillance and arrests without warrant, giving security forces greater rein to go after suspected extremist financiers and facilitators. Duterte has long warned that Mindanao faced contamination by Islamic State, and experts say Muslim parts of the predominantly Catholic southern Philippines are fertile ground for expansion, due to their history of marginalization and neglect. Critics of Duterte, who has held open the possibility of extending military rule to the whole country, have slammed the imposition of martial law in Mindanao as a misuse of power and evidence of the president s authoritarian tendencies. Martial law is a sensitive issue in the Philippines, bringing back memories of the 1970s rule of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who was accused of exaggerating security threats to justify harsh measures to suppress dissent. Human rights group Karapatan questioned why martial law should be extended in Mindanao nearly two months after the military s victory in Marawi City.  This is a dangerous precedent that inches the entire country closer to a nationwide declaration of martial rule,  it said in a statement.      ',\n",
       " 'JERUSALEM/GAZA (Reuters) - At least two people were killed in clashes with Israeli troops on Friday when thousands of Palestinians demonstrated against U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital and the Palestinian president said Washington could no longer be a peace broker. Across the Arab and Muslim worlds, thousands more protesters took to the streets on the Muslim holy day to express solidarity with the Palestinians and outrage at Trump s reversal of decades of U.S. policy. Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian man near the Gaza border, the first confirmed death in two days of unrest. Scores of people were wounded on the  Day of Rage . A second person later died of their wounds, a Gaza hospital official said. The Israeli army said hundreds of Palestinians were rolling burning tyres and throwing rocks at soldiers across the border.  During the riots IDF soldiers fired selectively towards two main instigators and hits were confirmed,  it said. More than 80 Palestinians were wounded in the occupied West Bank and Gaza by Israeli live fire and rubber bullets, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance service. Dozens more suffered from tear gas inhalation. Thirty-one were wounded on Thursday. As Friday prayers ended at the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, worshippers made their way toward the walled Old City gates, chanting  Jerusalem is ours, Jerusalem is our capital  and  We don t need empty words, we need stones and Kalashnikovs . Scuffles broke out between protesters and police. In Hebron, Bethlehem and Nablus, dozens of Palestinians threw stones at Israeli soldiers who fired back with tear gas. In Gaza, controlled by the Islamist group Hamas, calls for worshippers to protest sounded over mosque loudspeakers. Hamas has called for a new Palestinian uprising like the  intifadas  of 1987-1993 and 2000-2005, which together saw thousands of Palestinians and more than 1,000 Israelis killed.  Whoever moves his embassy to occupied Jerusalem will become an enemy of the Palestinians and a target of Palestinian factions,  said Hamas leader Fathy Hammad as protesters in Gaza burned posters of Trump.  We declare an intifada until the liberation of Jerusalem and all of Palestine.  Protests largely died down as night fell. Rocket sirens sounded in southern Israeli towns near the Gaza border, and the Israeli military said it had intercepted one of at least two  projectiles fired from Gaza. No casualties were reported. Al Aqsa Martyrs  Brigade, a militant group linked to Abbas s Fatah party, claimed responsibility for firing one of the rockets, and said it was in protest against Trump s decision. The military said another rocket hit the Israeli town of Sderot. No casualties were reported. Israel s military said that in response to the rocket fire, its aircraft bombed militant targets in Gaza and the Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 25 people were wounded in the strikes, including six children. The Israeli military said it had carried out the strikes on a militant training camp and on a weapons depot. Witnesses said most of the wounded were residents of a building near the camp.  At the United Nations, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Washington still had credibility as a mediator.  The United States has credibility with both sides. Israel will never be, and should never be, bullied into an agreement by the United Nations, or by any collection of countries that have proven their disregard for Israel s security,  Haley told the U.N. Security Council. But Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas appeared defiant.  We reject the American decision over Jerusalem. With this position the United States has become no longer qualified to sponsor the peace process,  Abbas said in a statement. He did not elaborate further. France, Italy, Germany, Britain and Sweden called on the United States to  bring forward detailed proposals for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement . Trump s announcement on Wednesday has infuriated the Arab world and upset Western allies. The status of Jerusalem has been one of the biggest obstacles to a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians for generations. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital. Palestinians want the eastern part of the city as the capital of a future independent state of their own. Most countries consider East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after capturing it in the 1967 Middle East War, to be occupied territory. It includes the Old City, home to sites considered holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians alike. For decades, Washington, like most of the rest of the international community, held back from recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital, saying its status should be determined as part of the Palestinian-Israeli peace process. No other country has an embassy there. The Trump administration argues that the peace process has become moribund, and outdated policies need to be jettisoned for the sides in the conflict to make progress. Trump has also noted that Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton all promised as candidates to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital.  I fulfilled my campaign promise - others didn t!  Trump tweeted on Friday with a video montage of campaign speeches on the issue by his three predecessors. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Friday it would still be up to the Israelis and Palestinians to hammer out all other issues surrounding the city in future talks.  With respect to the rest of Jerusalem, the president ... did not indicate any final status for Jerusalem. He was very clear that the final status, including the borders, would be left to the two parties to negotiate and decide.  Still, some Muslim countries view the Trump administration s motives with particular suspicion. As a candidate he proposed banning all Muslims from entering the United States, and in office he has tried to block entry by citizens of several Muslim-majority states. In Ramallah, the seat of Abbas s Palestinian Authority, the leader s religious affairs adviser said Trump s stance was an affront to Islam and Christianity alike.  America has chosen to elect a president who has put it in enmity with all Muslims and Christians,  said Mahmoud al-Habbash. In Iran, which has never recognized Israel and supports anti-Israel militants, demonstrators burned pictures of Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while chanting  Death to the Devil . In Cairo, capital of Egypt, a U.S. ally which has a peace treaty with Israel, hundreds of protesters who had gathered in Al-Azhar mosque and outside in its courtyard chanted  Jerusalem is Arab! O Trump, you madman, the Arab people are everywhere!  Al Azhar s Imam, Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, rejected an invitation to meet U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. Large demonstrations also took place in Jordan, Tunisia, Somalia, Yemen, Malaysia and Indonesia, and hundreds protested outside the U.S. embassy in Berlin. France said the United States had sidelined itself in the Middle East.  The reality is they are alone and isolated on this issue,  Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. ',\n",

       " 'DHAKA (Reuters) - Filmstar Angelina Jolie has condemned sexual violence inflicted on Rohingya women in Myanmar s Rakhine State, where a military counter-insurgency operation has sent hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees across the border to Bangladesh.  More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar since late August, driven out by the military s actions that a top United Nations official has described as a classic case of  ethnic cleansing . Jolie, a special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a Bangladesh delegation in the Canadian city of Vancouver that she planned to visit the Rohingya victims of sexual violence.  Later she mentioned accordingly in her keynote speech about the sexual violence faced by almost each female Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh and condemned the armed conflict in Myanmar,  Bangladesh s foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday. It gave no details of Jolie s proposed trip. On Thursday, New York-based Human Rights Watch accused Myanmar security forces of committing widespread rape against women and girls as part of a campaign of ethnic cleansing. The allegation echoes an accusation this week by Pramila Patten, the U.N. special envoy on sexual violence in conflict, who said sexual violence was  being commanded, orchestrated and perpetrated by the Armed Forces of Myanmar.  Myanmar s army released a report on Monday denying all allegations of rape and killings by security forces, days after replacing the general in charge of the operation.

       " 'On Tuesday, Tom Hayden, one of leading dirty hippies that drove Republicans (and Democrats) completely insane in the 1960s wrote a lengthy editorial in The Nation to announce that he was dropping his support of Bernie Sanders and voting for Hillary Clinton in the California primary. While not sparing a critical eye towards Clinton, he explains that despite not being an angel, she has successfully worked within the system for almost 50 years to affect change. According to Hayden, she has the best chance to beat the Republicans and advance her agenda through both a hostile Congress and an unsure electorate.Hayden actually agrees with most (all?) of Bernie s end goals, as do many of Hillary s supporters. We all want universal healthcare, more taxes on the rich, less guns on the street, equal pay for women and an end to income inequality, but where the problem comes is HOW to get there:The populist clarity of Bernie s proposals can be problematic, even for some of his supporters. For example, to simply reject Obamacare in the belief that  political revolution  will lead to a single-payer solution is simplistic.Hayden is worried Bernie has done nothing to ensure he will have the political muscle to make his plans work. A one election revolution won t cut it without  a Plan B, which requires at least two presidential terms and three more congressional elections. Take fracking for example. Hillary has been condemned for not calling for a total ban. But Hayden, a much more plugged in activist, is more impressed by Clinton s long term goals and less so by Sanders  absolutist stand:But Hillary s position goes beyond what virtually any state has done. The New York Times writes that she  has pledged to end subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to pay for her ambitious climate plan  and intends to install 500 million solar collectors in four years.Meanwhile, Bernie s total fracking ban leaves the question of how to do so unaddressed. His energy platform is comprehensive, but he offers no strategy to implement the Paris Summit in the short term.And it s not just Bernie s policies that Hayden is concerned with. There s also the question of his vulnerability as a candidate. Hayden, quite correctly, points out that Republicans have almost completely ignored Bernie:My second worry about Bernie s candidacy is that he has not really faced an all-out Republican-financed media assault in this entire campaign. If he s the nominee, that will be merciless.I ve had this discussion a number of times with Bernie supporters who think that Republican attacks will roll right off. But Republicans managed to convince a significant portion of the country that the center-left Obama is actually a far-left Socialist bordering on Communist and that Obamacare was a  government takeover.  The right-wing media machine is a propaganda tool that would make the totalitarian government in George Orwell s 1984 weep in pure jealously. By the end of the first month, Bernie would be labeled a Marxist. By the end of the second month, he would be the reincarnation of Stalin. And that would be among the nicer things they would say about him.Just to be crystal clear, a certain number of Bernie supporters insist that Obama is a center-right Republican. Yet it is undeniable that he s been successfully labeled a far-left radical by the right. How would Bernie be immune to this? There s no clear answer.Even worse, the automatic response from Bernie supporters is  They ll do the same thing to Hillary!  as if that would change the character assassination to come. But even that answer is unhelpful because they ve BEEN doing this to Hillary for longer than many of Bernie s supporters have been alive. The Clintons are the most scrutinized politicians to ever live, bar none. There are literally no new scandals to dig (or make) up. The Corporate Media has been trying to claim her scalp since the 90s and the right has spent millions upon millions on opposition research with only rumor and innuendo to show for it.What are they going to do? Hold some more Benghazi hearings? Good luck with that.But the main reason Hayden says he s supporting Hillary is that the black community is overwhelmingly supporting her:I intend to vote for Hillary Clinton in the California primary for one fundamental reason. It has to do with race. My life since 1960 has been committed to the causes of African Americans, the Chicano movement, the labor movement, and freedom struggles in Vietnam, Cuba and Latin America. What would cause me to turn my back on all those people who have shaped who I am? That would be a transgression on my personal code. I have been on too many freedom rides, too many marches, too many jail cells, and far too many gravesites to breach that trust.Some of Bernie s (overwhelmingly white) supporters have taken the not-so-subtly racist attitude that the black community doesn t know any better. But Hayden correctly points out that Bernie himself made the choice not to appeal to them:Bernie s campaign has had all the money in the world to invest in inner city organizing, starting 18 months ago. He chose to invest resources instead in white-majority regions at the expense of the Deep South and urban North.Blaming black people for not supporting Bernie when Bernie deliberately chose to focus his energy elsewhere is a deeply problematic attitude and a shirking of responsibility.There s (a lot) more and Hayden does not pull punches with either candidate, but his overall message is clear: Vote for whatever candidate you want in the primary, but at the end of the day, stopping the Republicans is more important than hero worship. If you want real change, you have to do more than vote in presidential elections, sit back and wait for it to come.Featured image via Getty',\n",

       " 'GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala s federal auditor on Tuesday said it will investigate a salary bonus the Defense Ministry gives to President Jimmy Morales that raises his earnings by more than a third, making him one of the best paid leaders in Latin America.  The federal comptroller, which audits all government spending, said in a statement it had asked for information on the previously unknown 50,000 quetzals ($7,300)  Bonus for Extraordinary Responsibility  that is not officially part of the president s salary package. Defense Minister William Mansilla on Tuesday confirmed that Morales had since December 2016 received the payment, which lifts the president s salary to $27,400 a month.   The president didn t ask for it. Instead, it was a group decision by the army,  Mansilla said in a press conference.  A technical board of auditors determined the bonus.  The revelation of the unusual salary perk comes at an awkward time for the beleaguered Morales, who managed to retain his immunity from prosecution on Monday.  Congress voted overwhelmingly to protect him after the attorney general submitted a request to investigate Morales over suspected financing irregularities during his 2015 election campaign. [nL2N1LS1EV] Last month, Guatemala s attorney general and the U.N.-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) jointly sought to investigate Morales, a former comedian, over the illegal financing allegation. Two days later, Morales declared the head of the U.N. body  persona non grata.  Under the leadership of Ivan Velasquez, a veteran Colombian prosecutor, CICIG has caused problems for Morales, first investigating his son and brother then aiming at him. The Defense Ministry on Tuesday posted on its website documents, dated Jan. 1, 2016, that detailed the payment to the president and various other military officials.  The considerations (for the bonus) were due to his position and the risks and dangers that (Morales) undertakes,  Mansilla said in explaining the army s reasoning for the payment.  Former Presidents Alfonso Portillo and Alvaro Colom told Reuters they had not received such a bonus. The president s office did not respond to requests for comment.  The salary bonus means that Morales earns 70 percent more than Chilean leader Michelle Bachelet and 130 percent more than Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, two of the region s best paid top officials.  The bonus is also 90 times the $300 minimum wage in Guatemala, where 60 percent of the population lives in poverty. ',\n",
       " 'MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law on Saturday new measures allowing authorities to list foreign media outlets as  foreign agents  in response to what Moscow says is unacceptable U.S. pressure on Russian media. The new law has been rushed through both Russian houses of parliament in the last two weeks. It will now allow Moscow to force foreign media to brand news they provide to Russians as the work of  foreign agents  and to disclose their funding sources. A copy of the law was published on the Russian government s online legislation database on Saturday, saying it entered into force from the day of its publication. Russia s move against U.S. media is part of the fallout from allegations that Russia interfered in last year s U.S. presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. U.S. intelligence officials have accused the Kremlin of using Russian media organizations it finances to influence U.S. voters, and Washington has since required Russian state broadcaster RT to register a U.S.-based affiliate company as a  foreign agent . The Kremlin has repeatedly denied meddling in the election and said the restrictions on Russian broadcasters in the United States are an attack on free speech.  The Russian Justice Ministry last week published a list of nine U.S.-backed news outlets that it said could be affected by the changes. It said it had written to the U.S. government-sponsored Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), along with seven separate Russian or local-language news outlets run by RFE/RL.

       " 'Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThis week a House Judiciary Committee began overseeing details of a US Federal Court case between tech company Apple and the FBI.On February 16th, Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly rejected a court order to decrypt an iPhone said to be connected to the San Bernardino mass-shooting case from December of 2015.The House Judiciary Committee listened to the controversial case between tech titan Apple and the FBI a day after Magistrate Judge James Orenstein of New York, struck down a federal court order pressuring Apple to help access encrypted data in a separate case involving illegal drug trafficking.The landmark decision made by Judge Orenstein stated that the All Writs Act of 1789 (also used as the FBI s main argument in the Apple/San Bernardino case) does not permit a court to order companies to pull encrypted data off a customer s phone or tablet,  according to a recent article from The Washington Post.The Post continued by discussing Orenstein s lengthy argument against the FBI s order against Apple in the drug related case: In a 50-page opinion disdainful of the government s arguments, Orenstein found that the All Writs Act does not apply in instances where Congress had the opportunity but failed to create an authority for the government to get the type of help it was seeking, such as having firms ensure they have a way to obtain data from encrypted phones. In addition, The Post outlined some of the social engineering aspects involved in the lead up to the FBI drug case overseen by Judge Orenstein, a case which has arguably been a part of an overarching back drop concerning the larger San Bernardino case: The Brooklyn case began last fall when Orenstein, one of a handful of magistrates across the country who are activists in the surveillance debate, received the government s application to issue an order to Apple. While Apple has previously helped the federal government with some 70 phone cases since 2008, Judge Orenstein examined several problems with the FBI s use of the All Writs Act: In an Oct. 9 ruling, Orenstein identified what he thought was a problem with the government s argument. Though prosecutors cited a 1985 decision that found that the All Writs Act is a source of authority to issue writs  not otherwise covered by statute,  he said they failed to cite another part of the decision that found that the act does not authorize the issuance of  ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate. The new ruling in the FBI drug case will likely have a heavy impact on the eventual ruling in the San Bernardino/Apple court order, as it directly questions the heart of the government s argument to gain easier access to encrypted consumer data.It s also interesting to note, that it was the FBI who put themselves in this position regarding the San Bernardino phone as they reportedly ordered the password to be reset via iCloud shortly after the apparent mass shooting.You have to wonder why the agency would have ordered a new password almost immediately following the highly dramatic scene in San Bernardino   INVENTIONS OF REALITY?    Is this latest  privacy crisis  a manufactured drama or a legitimate battle for those in the tech industry? (Photo illustration 21WIRE)What s interesting here, is that ABC news reported on December 3rd, a day after the apparent shooting,  Sources say mobile phones, hard drives, virtually anything with digital memory that was associated with the alleged shooters   Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik   was smashed. Adding to that, we ve mentioned a number of times here at 21WIRE, that none of the eyewitness testimony mentioned seeing a female shooter at the scene of the Inland Regional Center in the aftermath of the San Bernardino shooting.A Right to PrivacyIn our previous article detailing the ongoing encryption saga between Apple and the FBI, we stated that there are no guarantees in the security world, especially if a digital master-key were to be created, as this would potentially make it easier for invaders (either the government, or various hackers) mining for data moving forward into the future.In a recent Guardian article, some of those involved in the technology and security sector offered their thoughts regarding the government s continued encroachment on individual privacy:Dan Kaminsky, the security expert who made his name with the discovery that one of the most basic parts of the internet, the domain name system, was vulnerable to fraud   disagrees:  Feds want final authority on engineering decisions, and their interests don t even align with fighting the vast bulk of real-world crime. Kaminsky further explained why Apple s security measures already help law enforcement, If my iPhone is stolen, my emails stay unread, my photos stay unviewed, and I don t need to notify anyone that the secrets they entrusted me with are going to show up on the internet tomorrow. Continuing, The Guardian interviewed former FBI agent Michael German, currently at judicial think-tank the Brennan Center. The following is a portion of that interview: After 9/11, you had this concept of total information awareness. The intelligence community was very enamoured of the idea that all information was available. Much like the NSA, they wanted to see it all, collect it all, and analyse it all. Additionally, there are many who believe weaker encryption may pose an even bigger security risk globally.In many ways, it appears as though federal agencies are seemingly searching for the right crisis to push public opinion in favor of the state when it comes to security.This is at the core of the perpetual privacy and security battle post 9/11   TARGETING PRIVACY    FBI Director James Comey speaking at the Brookings Institution in October of 2014 about Going Dark. (Photo link brookings)Shining a Light on the FBI  Going Dark Last September, The Washington Post published an article entitled, Obama faces growing momentum to support widespread encryption,   and within its contents, perhaps the true nature of the security/privacy issue was laid bare (hat tip saperetic): Privately, law enforcement officials have acknowledged that prospects for congressional action this year are remote. Although  the legislative environment is very hostile today,  the intelligence community s top lawyer, Robert S. Litt, said to colleagues in an August e-mail, which was obtained by The Post,  it could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement. There is value, he said, in  keeping our options open for such a situation. Interestingly, in October of 2014, FBI Director James B. Comey, explained while speaking at the Brookings Institution he was  focused on trying to get the law changed  so that tech companies would have to comply with law enforcement to unlock data on various devices.Continuing, he outlined the current security agenda concerning the FBI,  We have the legal authority to intercept and access communications and information pursuant to a court order, but we often lack the technical ability to do that. The Brookings speech from 2014, appeared in stark contrast with a recent emotionally driven op-ed Comey wrote for Lawfare entitled  We Could Not Look the Survivors in the Eye if We Did Not Follow this Lead. Here s a passage from that piece, that clearly displays the conflicting message of the FBI director: We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist s passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That s it. We don t want to break anyone s encryption or set a master key loose on the land. The Guardian refers to this as a  two-pronged approach  on the public s senses   as one tone from the FBI comes across as caring and the other seems more focused on the greater, nationalistic implications of encryption.Think good cop/bad cop hovering over you in an interrogation room and you d be getting very warm.This is the kind of psychological drama that has prompted some in media to think that the law enforcement agency has been exploiting the public in the wake of tragedy, in order to increase security measures.This is absolutely something to watch.So, what are we to make of the FBI s claims of going dark in the digital age?It has long since been claimed that intelligence agencies fear going dark in the age of high-tech gadgetry. This idea is vastly overblown and not rooted in reality, especially when you consider the many revelations concerning NSA spying, collection of bulk metadata and other tracking programs such as the IMSI catcher, otherwise known as Stingray (Stingray acts as cell tower locking onto all devices in a certain area) intercepts phone calls, texts, as well as your location.The very notion that law enforcement will somehow be condemned eternally to outdated methods to catch criminals in the future   is patently absurd.Furthermore, the concept and presentation of the FBI s  going dark  scenario is nothing more than a talking point used to increase a police state apparatus within the United States.Don t PanicOn February 1st, a group of experts published report regarding the current status of law enforcement and their ability to keep up with the demands of crime solving in the world today. The lengthy report entitled  Don t Panic was compiled by The Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. Here s a passage below examining the FBI s catchy mantra,  Going Dark :The U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities view this trend with varying degrees of alarm, alleging that their interception capabilities are  going dark.  As they describe it, companies are increasingly adopting technological architectures that inhibit the government s ability to obtain access to communications, even in circumstances that satisfy the Fourth Amendment s warrant requirements. Encryption is the hallmark of these architectures. Government officials are concerned because, without access to communications, they fear they may not be able to prevent terrorist attacks and investigate and prosecute criminal activity. Their solution is to force companies to maintain access to user communications and data, and provide that access to law enforcement on demand, pursuant to the applicable legal process. However, the private sector has resisted. Critics fear that architectures geared to guarantee such access would compromise the security and privacy of users around the world, while also hurting the economic viability of U.S. companies. They also dispute the degree to which the proposed solutions would truly prevent terrorists and criminals from communicating in mediums resistant to surveillance.While the report states that encryption is a difficult issue for law enforcement, all sorts of digital data is unencrypted and therefore can be accessed via a search warrant if there is cause   not to mention the spying capabilities of a plethora of smart devices also available for review.Below is FBI Director (former Senior Vice President at Lockheed Martin) discussing the idea that the government is Going Dark In an article entitled  Here s Why the FBI Went After Apple When It Did,  Fortune magazine revealed that on February 9th, DOJ head Loretta Lynch requested  an extra $38 million to help the FBI development workarounds on data encryption, bringing the total budget of what it calls  project Going Dark  to $69 million. Will the FBI continue to develop  encryption workarounds  in the event that they lose their battle with Apple over the San Bernardino case?In Summary Regardless of how you shape the court battle between Apple and the FBI, this is about the government wanting a more direct route into personal devices moving ahead.For Apple, this is a very important issue as a dip in consumer confidence, could be a crushing blow to the tech company s overall brand.It s important to remember anomaly ridden events such as the San Bernardino shooting and the suspicious events in Garland, Texas, of last year, in addition to other inconvenient truths concerning the government s role in manufacturing its own terror plots   which have ironically prompted calls for greater national security, while continuing to appropriate large funds to federal agencies.You have to wonder, has the FBI s case against Apple fallen apart?READ MORE ENCRYPTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Encryption Files',\n",

       " 'A white football player from Idaho will not face jail time, after being accused of raping a mentally disabled black student with a coat hanger. [John R. K. Howard, 19, will instead serve out the punishment initially handed down by the courts in October of 2015, when he received a   probation and 300 hours of community service.  The courts decided against prison time, after a judge accepted a plea deal which allowed Howard to plead guilty and still maintain innocence. That plea, also known as the Alford plea, technically allows the client to continue maintaining innocence while acknowledging that the evidence against them is serious enough that the jury could find them guilty. The victimâ\\x80\\x99s family have not spoken publicly, but according to the Independent, are â\\x80\\x9cfuriousâ\\x80\\x9d at the courtâ\\x80\\x99s decision. The victim relayed the harrowing details of the rape during the trial of one of the other accused rapists, Tanner Ward. â\\x80\\x9cAfter practice I was in the locker room, and one of my friends, he told me to come here, and I went over to him and gave him a hug,â\\x80\\x9d the victim said during testimony obtained by the Guardian. â\\x80\\x9cHe told me to give him a hug. He had his hands out like he was going to give me a hug. And I gave him a hug, and he signaled for one of my other friends to come over. â\\x80\\x9d At that point, the rape commenced. The victim described his feelings during the rape, saying, â\\x80\\x9cPain that I have never felt took over my body. I screamed, but afterwards, I kept it to myself. â\\x80\\x9d The assailant, Howard, faced the charge of forcible sexual penetration by a foreign object, a charge which was later reduced. According to the Independent, â\\x80\\x9c  â\\x80¦    following negotiations between the defence counsel and the State Attorney Generalâ\\x80\\x99s office  â\\x80\\x94   in which the state prosecutor, Deputy Attorney General Casey Hemmer, claimed the attack was not racially motivated and did not constitute a sex crime  â\\x80\\x94   the felony rape charge was dropped and replaced by a lesser charge of felony injury to a child. â\\x80\\x9d The victim, aged 17 at the time of the attack, qualified as a minor. The judge also referred to the attack as â\\x80\\x9cbullying. â\\x80\\x9d As for the racial component of all this, the Independent reports, â\\x80\\x9cLegal documents filed by the family in a separate case suing the school and district officials claim before the attack, the victim was â\\x80\\x9ctaunted and called racist names by other members of the team which names included â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98chicken eaterâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98watermelonâ\\x80\\x99 and [the  ]â\\x80\\x9c. The familyâ\\x80\\x99s lawsuit against the school states that coaches on the football team encouraged players to toughen the victim up, presumably through fighting or hazing, and that coaches confronted the victim before the trial, convincing him to repudiate his own statement. During that episode, another coach recorded the conversation. According to the victim, â\\x80\\x9cI just started telling a bunch of just lies because I wanted my friends back. â\\x80\\x9d The victim has attempted to commit suicide multiple times since the incident occurred in late 2015. Meanwhile, should John Howard violate his probation, he will face a possible prison sentence of up to ten years.

       " 'Just days after a national campaign in which he vowed repeatedly to repeal President Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s signature health care law, Donald J. Trump is sending signals that his approach to health care is a work in progress. Mr. Trump even indicated that he would like to keep two of the most popular benefits of the Affordable Care Act, one that forces insurers to cover people with   health conditions and another that allows parents to cover children under their plan into their  . He told The Wall Street Journal that he was reconsidering his stance after meeting with Mr. Obama on Thursday. The comments added to a sense of whiplash about the law and its future. More than 100, 000 Americans rushed to buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday, the biggest turnout yet during this yearâ\\x80\\x99s   period, underscoring that millions of people now depend on the law for coverage. Beyond Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s comments, new plans laid out on his presidential transition website this week deviate from what he had proposed during the campaign, and he added ideas that appeared to more closely align with the mainstream Republican agenda. The new plans drop all mention of reining in high drug prices, which Mr. Trump had advocated for months, and add new language about modernizing Medicare, a potential nod to congressional efforts to give people vouchers toward buying private health insurance. â\\x80\\x9cHealth care is shaping up as a priority for the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress,â\\x80\\x9d said Larry Levitt, an executive at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which closely tracks health policy. â\\x80\\x9cBut we still have very little detail about what that really means. â\\x80\\x9d The health care industry, which invested hundreds of millions of dollars in preparing for business under the Affordable Care Act, is disoriented about what to do next  â\\x80\\x94   and scrambling for ways to avoid a financial shock. A repeal of the act would mean the loss of millions of customers for insurance companies and uninsured people turning to hospital emergency rooms for basic care. Mr. Trump, in an interview to be broadcast on CBSâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9c60 Minutes,â\\x80\\x9d said the guarantee of coverage for people with   conditions was â\\x80\\x9cone of the strongest assetsâ\\x80\\x9d of the law. He also said he would try to preserve the measure allowing young adults to remain on their parentsâ\\x80\\x99 insurance until age 26. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re going to do it simultaneously  â\\x80\\x94   itâ\\x80\\x99ll be just fine,â\\x80\\x9d he said, saying that people would not lose coverage when the law was repealed. Policy experts say that the part of the law that Mr. Trump is rethinking, that prevents insurers from refusing to cover people with costly medical conditions, only works financially for insurers if there are plenty of healthy people also buying insurance. If only sick people enroll, premiums would soar. To get healthy people covered, the existing law includes generous subsidies to help more people to afford a policy and taxes people who donâ\\x80\\x99t buy insurance. Industry executives say their first priority is to persuade Mr. Trump and the new Congress to replace the law with some way for people to continue getting coverage. The problem is that, until now, top executives from the biggest insurers have not heard from Mr. Trump or his close advisers about his plans. In fact, the industry as a whole made no contingency plans for a Trump victory and does not yet appear to have developed a strategy. In the last few days, executives have huddled hurriedly with their boards and advisers to discuss how to react. In mapping out various election result possibilities, â\\x80\\x9cthis wasnâ\\x80\\x99t on the sheet,â\\x80\\x9d said Mark Bertolini, the chief executive of Aetna. â\\x80\\x9cWe had no idea how to approach it. â\\x80\\x9d The consequences are urgent. About 22 million Americans would be without insurance if the law were repealed. The state marketplaces, where about 10 million of those people buy insurance, would no longer exist. The millions of others who were newly eligible for Medicaid would also lose coverage. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m concerned about the fear factor of what is going on,â\\x80\\x9d said Bernard J. Tyson, the chief executive of Kaiser Permanente, the system based in California that includes hospitals, doctors and an insurance plan. He said the company was already getting calls from people worried about whether they would still be able to get coverage. Both federal officials and insurance executives say people should not hesitate to sign up during the current open enrollment period. Terri Marsh, 61, in Goose Creek, S. C. did not hesitate to sign up again for a Blue Cross plan as soon as she could. â\\x80\\x9cInsurance is something you have to have,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Before the marketplace plans were available, she had been without coverage for five years, despite having a serious inflammatory disease. â\\x80\\x9cBecause I have a   disease that is off the wall for them, I could not get insurance,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Without getting the coverage through the law, she said, â\\x80\\x9cI could possibly be dead. â\\x80\\x9d Yet Republicans have seized on some areas where the law is struggling and in the   insurance marketplaces in particular. This month, for example, Republicans highlighted the sharp rise in the average price of an insurance plan on the marketplace  â\\x80\\x94   25 percent  â\\x80\\x94   as proof that the law was fatally flawed. Mr. Bertolini warned that rates could go even higher next year. Without a   supermajority in the Senate, Republicans will probably be unable to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act. But they can eliminate several consequential provisions through a special budgetary process called reconciliation. Last year, the Senate passed a reconciliation bill that undid large portions of the health bill. The House passed it. President Obama vetoed it. The bill would have eliminated the expansion of Medicaid coverage for Americans near or below the poverty line. It would have eliminated subsidies to help   Americans buy their own insurance on new marketplaces. It would have eliminated tax penalties for the uninsured, meant to urge everyone to obtain health insurance. And it would have eliminated a number of taxes created by the law to help fund those programs. (It was written to kick in after two years, meaning the programs would not disappear immediately.) Many parts of the law cannot be repealed through reconciliation. Among them are reforms to the Medicare program, a provision that requires insurers to cover young adults on their parentsâ\\x80\\x99 policies, and requirements that health insurers sell policies to anyone regardless of their health history. Those parts of the law are very likely to remain law. Crucial aspects of the bill can be undone in a number of other ways, too. The administration could simply halt efforts to sign people up for the state marketplace plans. Or Congress could eliminate the federal subsidies that help millions of people afford a plan. Either one of those moves would most likely cause far fewer people to sign up for insurance, leading to instability or collapse of the insurance marketplaces. â\\x80\\x9cThere are a lot of different triggers that can be pulled,â\\x80\\x9d said Benjamin Isgur, the leader of the PwC Health Research Institute. For the insurers and hospitals, the challenge is to persuade   Trump that an alternative to the online marketplaces is necessary. Insurers will feel the loss of customers both in the individual market and under state Medicaid programs. While most are well diversified into other areas of insurance, the Affordable Care Act was seen as a way to forestall the steady erosion in   insurance. The companies spent years and millions investing in being able to sell new policies through the state marketplaces, operating under an entirely new model. Hospitals, however, are likely to be the biggest losers. Under the law, they agreed to get less money from the government, essentially in exchange for having to cover fewer uninsured people. â\\x80\\x9cIf repeal happens, are there voices in the industry loud enough to replace it?â\\x80\\x9d said Sam Glick, a partner at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm. Executives insist that the proposals that have been discussed before, including by Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House and a Republican, laid out how to replace the coverage and would allow people to transition to different options. The Trump administration and Congress â\\x80\\x9care not going to pull out the rug from people,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. J. Mario Molina, the chief executive of Molina Healthcare, a   insurer. He predicted that the earliest the law could be repealed was 2018, and that it would be replaced with something like a modified version of Medicaid, the government insurance for poor people. â\\x80\\x9cThe debate is not around the what, but around the how,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Because Mr. Trump has been short on detailing exactly what he plans to do, though, many in the industry argue they cannot prepare a strategy in advance. He has said broadly that he wants to repeal the law, for example, and give states more control over Medicaid programs. He has talked about being able to sell insurance across state lines and has recently discussed a return to the state programs that existed to help cover people with serious medical conditions. â\\x80\\x9cThis is Day 1 of figuring out what all of this means,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Glick of Oliver Wyman said Wednesday.',\n",

       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Wednesday said that any attempt to hype up its decision to jail a Taiwanese rights activist for subversion would be futile, after Taiwan s ruling political party labeled the result  unacceptable . A Chinese court on Tuesday jailed Li Ming-che, Taiwanese community college lecturer and human rights non-governmental worker, for five years for subverting Chinese state power.  Li was tried alongside a mainland activist, Peng Yuhua, who received a seven year sentence for the same charge. Both were found guilty of attempting to promote political reform in China through discussions of democracy in social media chatrooms. Taiwan s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said the result was  totally unacceptable  and called for Beijing to return Li to Taiwan. It is not a crime for Li to share his opinions about democratic freedoms with friends, they said. China s Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Ma Xiaoguang told reporters at a regular news briefing:  Any attempts to hype up the case for political ends or to instigate opposition between compatriots across the straits will all be futile.  Although Taiwan and Beijing should have mutual respect for each other s social systems and development paths, Taiwan cannot  impose  its political ideas on the mainland or use the cover of democratic freedoms to break Chinese law, Ma said.     Ties between Beijing and the self-ruled island of Taiwan have been frosty since Taiwan s Tsai Ing-wen led the independence-leaning DPP to election victory last year.  Beijing claims the island as part of China and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. Chiu E-Ling, secretary general of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday that Li s supporters would call on Tsai and her government go beyond mere words to secure Li s release.  They also expressed concern over the verdict s implication for the rights of Taiwanese citizens, saying that Li had expressed his opinions online while on Taiwan soil.  The Global Times, a state-backed tabloid popular with China s nationalists, said in an editorial on Wednesday that the DPP s statement was tantamount to encouraging Taiwanese to come to China and break the law.  We hope that Taiwanese people will not accept the DPP s witchcraft and will not become an assault team or sacrificial victims for them,  the paper said.  One s own safety should be more important than the slogans they utter,  it added. ',\n",
       " 'The United Nations Human Rights Commission has expressed concerns about a video that captures members of a   youth militia in Burundi singing about raping their adversaries. [â\\x80\\x9cImpregnate those opponents, so that they give birth to Imbonerakure,â\\x80\\x9d says the troubling verse in the song.  The Imbonerakure are the youth wing of President Pierre Nkurunzizaâ\\x80\\x99s party (â\\x80\\x9cyouthâ\\x80\\x9d defined as â\\x80\\x9cany party member age 35 or younger,â\\x80\\x9d according to an NPR report on the group). Their name means â\\x80\\x9cthose who see farâ\\x80\\x9d in the Kurundi language. The opposition in Burundi has accused the Imbonerakure of militant violence, including dressing up as policemen to attack opposition demonstrators. Some of this violence has resulted in fatalities, as the militia has been known to use machetes and grenades in its attacks. The military has allegedly provided guns and explosives to the Imbonerakure. In rural Burundi, they are said to have more power than the military or police. Nkurunzizaâ\\x80\\x99s   party denies the most damaging allegations against the Imbonerakure or distances itself from the youth militia when it becomes politically inconvenient. The latter course seems to have been pursued here. At first, the   claimed the video showing the â\\x80\\x9crape songâ\\x80\\x9d was a fake filmed outside Burundi, but later it admitted the footage was authentic and said the song â\\x80\\x9cdoes not conform to the morals or ideologyâ\\x80\\x9d of the party. A spokesman for the U. N. High Commissioner for Human Rights told Voice of America the Imbonerakure are waging a campaign of terror across Burundi that includes â\\x80\\x9chorrendousâ\\x80\\x9d acts of torture such as â\\x80\\x9cpeople being burnt with hot knives, acid being poured over parts of their body, teeth broken with rifle butts,â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cattacks on sexual organs. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThese grotesque rape chants by the young men of the Imbonerakure across several provinces across Burundi are deeply alarming  â\\x80\\x94   particularly because they confirm what we have been hearing from those who have fled Burundi about a campaign of fear and terror by this organized militia,â\\x80\\x9d said spokesman Rupert Colville. He added that his office has received reports of at least eight large rallies that included songs and slogans promoting rape and violence, and that senior government officials were present at some of them. Burundi has been teetering on the edge of civil war for years. The previous civil war ended in 2005, after killing some 300, 000 people, with a peace plan that limited Nkurunziza to two terms in office. However, he ran for and won a third term, claiming that his first term in office was ordained by parliament instead of the popular vote, so it should not count against the constitutional term limit. Burundiâ\\x80\\x99s constitutional court accepted this argument, but many citizens did not. His government has become increasingly repressive, especially after a failed coup attempt against him in 2015. Burundi is one of those nations where â\\x80\\x9cinsulting the presidentâ\\x80\\x9d is a crime punishable by jail time, even if the perpetrators are high school children. Much of the political violence in Burundi has an ethnic component, as the   is a party of the Hutu tribe, while many victims of oppression are members of the Tutsi minority, the same tribal conflict that turned Rwanda into a bloodbath. The U. N. High Commission for Human Rights chronicles numerous complaints of violence and the incitement to violence by   officials and the Imbonerakure militia, noting that â\\x80\\x9ccoded languageâ\\x80\\x9d about raping adversaries or making them disappear is all too easy to decode in a nation only a few years removed from bloody civil war. â\\x80\\x9cThe Government needs to stop pretending that the Imbonerakure are nothing but a community development group,â\\x80\\x9d said High Commissioner Zeid Raâ\\x80\\x99ad  . â\\x80\\x9cSuch blatant and brazen hate speech and incitement to violence must not be tolerated, nor encouraged. In a region which has suffered so many massive outbreaks of violence and atrocities, this type of organized incitement rings very loud alarm bells. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has recused himself from issues related to TransCanada Corpâ\\x80\\x99s application for a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, the State Department said in a letter on Thursday to the environmental group Greenpeace. â\\x80\\x9cHe has not worked on that matter at the Department of State, and will play no role in the deliberations or ultimate resolution of TransCanadaâ\\x80\\x99s application,â\\x80\\x9d said the letter from Katherine McManus, the State Departmentâ\\x80\\x99s deputy legal adviser. McManusâ\\x80\\x99 letter came after Greenpeace wrote to officials at the State Department and the Office of Government Ethics on Wednesday, urging Tillerson recuse himself from any decisions on the multibillion-dollar pipeline, given his former role as chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp.. Greenpeace argued in its letter that Exxon Mobil would â\\x80\\x9cdirectly and predictablyâ\\x80\\x9d benefit from the approval of Keystone XL because the firm has investments in Canadian oil sands. Tillerson recused himself from the matter in early February, McManus wrote. TransCanada tried for more than five years to build the 1,179-mile (1,897-km) pipeline, until President Barack Obama rejected it in 2015. TransCanada resubmitted its application for the Keystone project in January, after Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s White House successor, Donald Trump, signed an order smoothing its path. The line is designed to link existing pipeline networks in Canada and the United States to bring crude from Alberta and North Dakota to refineries in Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico. Exxon has a majority stake in Imperial Oil, a Calgary, -Alberta-based company that operates the Kearl oil sands project in northern Alberta. â\\x80\\x9cExxon Mobil could benefit from the approval of the pipeline if it has specific contracts or agreements with TransCanada either to transport their Canadian tar sands production, or to receive such shipments at their U.S. refineries,â\\x80\\x9d Greenpeace wrote in its letter on Wednesday. Tillerson wrote in a January letter to McManus that for one year after his resignation from Exxon Mobil, he â\\x80\\x9cwill not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which I know that Exxon Mobil is a party or represents a party, unless I am first authorized to participate.â\\x80\\x9d He also wrote that â\\x80\\x9con a case-by-case basis,â\\x80\\x9d he would recuse himself â\\x80\\x9cfrom participation in any particular matter involving specific parties in which I determine that a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts would question my impartiality in the matter, unless I am first authorized to participate.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",

The legislation, expected to be approved by the House Wednesday, was already introduced with support from the Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Tom Marino. Regulations impacting the economy, the environment, families, and our community should be done with great caution and transparency, not get rushed in last-minute on a President s way out of office. This is a good piece of legislation that will help keep this and future Presidents in check.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump lashed out at U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other â\\x80\\x9cdisloyalâ\\x80\\x9d Republicans on Tuesday and vowed to campaign in whatever style he wants now that the party establishment has largely abandoned him. Trump, in a barrage of stinging Twitter posts, condemned the Republicans who have backed away from his White House run, deepening a dramatic rift in the party over his struggling campaign for the Nov. 8 election. â\\x80\\x9cIt is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said on Twitter, adding he would engage Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on his own terms. Describing â\\x80\\x9cdisloyalâ\\x80\\x9d Republicans as more difficult than Clinton, he said: â\\x80\\x9cThey come at you from all sides. They donâ\\x80\\x99t know how to win - I will teach them!â\\x80\\x9d A string of Republican officials and officeholders have distanced themselves from Trump since a 2005 video surfaced on Friday showing him bragging crudely to a reporter about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances. Despite the turn away from Trump by some elected Republicans, a Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters, released on Tuesday, found 58 percent of Republicans wanted Trump to stay atop their partyâ\\x80\\x99s ticket and 68 percent said the Republican leadership should stand by him. The poll, which was conducted after the second presidential debate on Sunday, showed Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s lead over Trump widening to 8 points from 5 points last week, before the release of the video.  Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, told party lawmakers on Monday he was breaking with Trump and would not campaign for him, all but conceding Clinton would win the presidency. The move angered some Trump supporters, although Ryan said he would not withdraw his endorsement of the New York businessman. Trump slammed Ryan as a â\\x80\\x9cvery weak and ineffective leaderâ\\x80\\x9d and complained in another tweet that it was hard to do well with â\\x80\\x9czero supportâ\\x80\\x9d from Ryan and others. He later said in an interview with Fox News host Bill Oâ\\x80\\x99Reilly he neither wanted nor needed Ryanâ\\x80\\x99s support. Ryanâ\\x80\\x99s spokesman, Brendan Buck, said on Tuesday that the speaker â\\x80\\x9cis focusing the next month on defeating Democrats, and all Republicans running for office should probably do the same.â\\x80\\x9d Trump also took aim at U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, who said on Saturday that he could not vote for Trump. â\\x80\\x9cThe very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. There was no immediate reaction from McCain, who secured his primary election win in August.  Many Republicans worry that Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s chaotic campaign could hurt their chances of holding majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in next monthâ\\x80\\x99s election, and will inflict long-term damage on the party. In an extraordinary party revolt, nearly half of all 331 incumbent Republican senators, House members and governors have condemned Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s lewd remarks on the video, and roughly one in 10 has called for him to drop out of the race, a Reuters review of official statements and local news coverage indicates. Unlike Ryan, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told RNC members on Monday that the committee, the partyâ\\x80\\x99s leadership and fundraising arm, still backed Trump, two RNC members told Reuters.  Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, also reinforced his support in television interviews on Monday. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former 2016 Republican presidential contender who has became a close ally of Trump, also reaffirmed his backing, although he called Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s comments in the 2005 video â\\x80\\x9ccompletely indefensible.â\\x80\\x9d  Trump, 70, who has portrayed himself as tough on national security, released a hard-hitting television advertisement on Tuesday featuring footage of Clinton, a 68-year-old former secretary of state, stumbling last month after leaving a service commemorating the Sept. 11 attacks. Her campaign said she had been diagnosed a few days earlier with pneumonia. â\\x80\\x9cHillary Clinton doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have the fortitude, strength or stamina to lead in our world,â\\x80\\x9d the adâ\\x80\\x99s narrator says. â\\x80\\x9cShe failed as secretary of state. Donâ\\x80\\x99t let her fail us again.â\\x80\\x9d Both Trump and Clinton headed to the key battleground state of Florida on Tuesday. Before her Florida rally with former Vice President Al Gore, Clinton told a Miami radio station that Trump had â\\x80\\x9cinsulted everyone.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPeople need to understand whatâ\\x80\\x99s at stake in this election,â\\x80\\x9d she told WMBM. The White House said on Tuesday that Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s remarks about groping women in the video amounted to sexual assault. President Barack Obama said Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s remarks would disqualify him from a job at a convenience store, and should disqualify him from becoming president.  Clinton, the first woman to be picked as a presidential nominee by a major U.S. party, tried to focus on Tuesday on issues that could win over undecided women voters, proposing to expand the child tax credit so that more low-income families can benefit and to increase by $1,000 a year the tax credit available to families for each child up to age 4.

       " 'DUBAI (Reuters) - The four Arab countries boycotting Qatar added 11 more individuals and two other entities, including a major group of Islamist scholars, to their  terrorist  blacklists for the Gulf state, Saudi state news agency SPA reported on Thursday. The lists now include the Qatar-based International Union of Muslim Scholars (IUMS) which was formed in 2004 mostly by clerics belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood and is chaired by the influential Sheikh Youssef al-Qaradawi.  A statement issued by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain said they also blacklisted the International Islamic Council (IIC).   The two entities listed are two terrorist organizations that promote terrorism by using Islamic rhetoric as a cover to facilitate terrorist activities,  the statement said. The move deepened the rift between the four countries and Qatar, the world s top gas exporter and host to the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East. The countries cut ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of financing militants in Syria and allying with Iran, their regional foe. The Saudi-led quartet also added 11 individuals to their lists, including the acting Brotherhood leader Mahmoud Ezzat Ibrahim. The Muslim Brotherhood movement led the Arab Spring protests in 2011 that toppled some autocrats in the Middle East and North Africa. The Gulf States  rulers see the group, whose political ideology challenges the principle of dynastic rule, as a security threat. The IUMS membership includes the Saudi cleric Salman al-Awdah, who was arrested by Saudi authorities in September, the Tunisian Rached Ghannouchi, head of the Ennahda party, and Moroccan scholar Ahmed Raissouni. Mediation efforts of the Qatar crisis led by Kuwait and shuttle diplomacy by Western officials, including U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, have failed to end what has become the worst rift between Gulf Arab states in years.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bernie Sandersâ\\x80\\x99 high-flying Democratic presidential campaign fell back to Earth on Saturday in Nevada.  If the Vermont senator cannot quickly find a way to broaden his appeal to minorities and union members, last weekâ\\x80\\x99s 22-point rout of Clinton in New Hampshire could prove to be his campaign highlight. The race moves next week to South Carolina, where blacks make up more than half of the Democratic electorate, and on March 1 to a string of southern states with big blocs of African-Americans, who strongly support Clinton and have been slow to warm to Sanders. The rush of March contests in big, diverse states â\\x80\\x94 Democrats in nearly two dozen states will vote between March 1 and March 15 â\\x80\\x94 could leave Sanders grasping for political life. â\\x80\\x9cThis was a bad day for Sanders,â\\x80\\x9d said David Woodard, a political scientist at Clemson University in South Carolina. â\\x80\\x9cHe needs to find a way to cut into Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s base, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t think he is going to find it here.â\\x80\\x9d Although Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s 5-point win was relatively narrow, it was enough to blunt Sandersâ\\x80\\x99 momentum. Recent voter surveys had shown a tight race in Nevada, raising the prospect of another damaging setback for Clinton.      Entrance polls in Nevada showed Clinton trounced Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, by 3-to-1 among black voters, and also beat him in union households by 11 percentage points. The enthusiasm of younger and liberal voters who rallied around Sandersâ\\x80\\x99 calls for reining in Wall Street and reducing income equality was not enough in Nevada to counter Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s union and organizational clout, allowing her to reclaim front-runner status as the race shifts to more friendly turf. After the New Hampshire setback, Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s campaign was banking that Sanders would be unable to breach a so-called â\\x80\\x9cfirewallâ\\x80\\x9d of Hispanic and African-American support for the former Secretary of State in southern and western states.  Nevadaâ\\x80\\x99s result appeared to support that view. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s running a strong campaign, but being close is overrated if you canâ\\x80\\x99t make the sale,â\\x80\\x9d said Mo Elleithee, a Clinton aide in her 2008 campaign and now the executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. The Sanders campaign said it was heartened in Nevada by entrance polls showing he beat Clinton among Hispanics by about eight points. â\\x80\\x9cWhat we learned today is Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s firewall with Latino voters is a myth,â\\x80\\x9d Arturo Carmona, deputy political director for Bernie 2016, said in a statement. But the Clinton campaign questioned those numbers, saying that at one point she had won 60 percent of the delegates in 22 Latino-majority precincts.  Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s convincing showing in Nevada could reduce the chances of a late run by an independent candidate such as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who would likely scoop up moderate voters turned off by a socialist nominee. In a sense, Sanders was a victim in Nevada of his own success. His ability to close the gap on Clinton in Iowa and rout her in New Hampshire, nearly all-white states, raised expectations that he could ride to another upset in Nevada. â\\x80\\x9cNevada put out the Bern,â\\x80\\x9d said Ken Tietjen, a Clinton supporter who stood outside her Las Vegas victory rally at Caesarâ\\x80\\x99s Palace. â\\x80\\x9cHillary has all the momentum going forward.â\\x80\\x9d But Sandersâ\\x80\\x99 strong showings in the first three contests, along with his formidable fundraising, suggest staying power. That could help extend the Democratic race beyond the cluster of early March contests and into April and May, when a string of contests in whiter and more liberal states could help him. Sanders has money for the long haul, although Clinton had more on hand at the end of January. Federal election reports filed as the Nevada results were announced showed Sanders had raised $21.3 million in January and had $14.7 million on hand. In January, Hillary raised $13.2 million from individual donors and had $32.9 million on hand. Some black voters said on Saturday they did not see a reason to switch their loyalty away from Clinton, a fondness that dates back to her husband Bill Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s presidency but which was strained by her bitter primary battle with Barack Obama in 2008.

Iâ\\x80\\x99m down with Bernie too.â\\x80\\x9d Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s embrace of Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s presidential legacy, and her argument that Sanders would begin to unravel some of Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s policies on healthcare and other issues, also has made an impression. Darien Gambrell, 23, said she heard Clinton planned to continue a number of Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s policies. â\\x80\\x9cI think thatâ\\x80\\x99s a good thing.

       " 'WASHINGTON  â\\x80\\x94   Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to remember today that to President Obama, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey once embodied a new kind of Muslim leader. Mr. Obama regarded him as â\\x80\\x9ca man of principle, and also a man of action,â\\x80\\x9d Tom Donilon, the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s former national security adviser, said in 2011. But when Mr. Erdogan began tilting in the direction of authoritarianism, ascending from prime minister to president and setting out to transform Turkey from a parliamentary democracy into a   system built around him, their   relationship deteriorated. His frequent phone calls with Mr. Obama ended, and Mr. Erdogan has observed that they rarely speak anymore. On Tuesday morning, the phone calls resumed. Mr. Obama called Mr. Erdogan to deliver what a senior administration official described as a â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x9d for his resilience in the face of a failed coup attempt, and to express relief that the Turkish president and his family were safe. Mr. Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s supportive words, even in the face of a state of emergency that Mr. Erdogan declared on Wednesday and a crackdown that extended to banning every academic in the country from traveling abroad, testified to the stark reality the White House confronts with Turkey. Mr. Erdogan may now be a bitter disappointment to the president, but he is still better than any other option  â\\x80\\x94   and, like it or not, remains a linchpin in the campaign against the Islamic State and in a host of other critical issues. For Mr. Obama, as for many of his predecessors, it is a familiar accommodation, struggling to square values and interests in the chaotic landscape of the Middle East. In Egypt, for example, the United States has tolerated a repressive military government in an effort to preserve another crucial alliance in the region. â\\x80\\x9cWhatever our concerns might be about the direction the Erdogan government is going  â\\x80\\x94   and there are legitimate concerns  â\\x80\\x94   nobody thinks that a military coup is a legitimate or sensible alternative,â\\x80\\x9d said Philip H. Gordon, who coordinated Middle East policy on the National Security Council until 2015. Had the coup succeeded, administration officials said, Turkey most likely would have plunged into a protracted period of instability, perhaps even civil war. That would have made it an even less reliable partner in the campaign against the Islamic State after the United States and its allies won the right last July to use Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to launch airstrikes against the group. Those operations were halted when the Turkish authorities cut off electricity to Incirlik, after it emerged that the baseâ\\x80\\x99s commander was linked to the coup plotters. American officials said the operations had resumed, though they acknowledged that Turkey, and especially its military, would be preoccupied for the foreseeable future by the fallout from the attempted coup. The government has charged nearly 100 generals and admirals, and detained thousands of other officers, as Mr. Erdoganâ\\x80\\x99s purge widens. On Tuesday, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. spoke with Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s chief of defense, Gen. Hulusi Akar. A Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Gregory L. Hicks, said they had agreed to â\\x80\\x9ccontinue a close U. S.     partnership. â\\x80\\x9d During their phone call on the same day, administration officials said, Mr. Obama urged Mr. Erdogan to stay focused on the threat from the Islamic State. â\\x80\\x9cI think we donâ\\x80\\x99t need to remind Turkey of that,â\\x80\\x9d Brett H. McGurk, the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s special envoy to the coalition against the Islamic State, told reporters. â\\x80\\x9cThey just suffered terrible attacks at Istanbul airport only a couple weeks ago with a number of suicide bombers. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Erdogan, however, is more likely to be consumed by threats from Kurdish separatists and from supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the Muslim cleric living in   exile in Pennsylvania, whom Mr. Erdogan has accused of fomenting the coup. During their phone call, the Turkish president urged Mr. Obama to hand over Mr. Gulen, and his government has submitted the paperwork to begin a formal request for his extradition. The White House has declined to comment on the merits of the arguments made by the Turkish government that he should be returned to Turkey. But extraditing the cleric, officials said, is a lengthy, complex process that involves an assessment by the Justice Department, followed by a ruling by a federal judge. Mr. Obama, they said, has nothing to do with it. Mr. Obama and Mr. Erdogan have weathered previous disagreements. At a summit meeting in Toronto in 2010, the two had a fiery,   exchange over Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s decision to vote against imposing sanctions on Iran in the United Nations Security Council. Mr. Erdogan was still bruised by the White Houseâ\\x80\\x99s spurning of a diplomatic effort by Turkey and Brazil to broker a deal with Iran over its nuclear program. Administration officials acknowledged that they were partly to blame for sending the Turks a poorly worded letter that could have been interpreted as endorsing the diplomatic initiative. It was the first major jolt in a relationship that had begun on an auspicious note in 2009, when Mr. Obama chose Turkey as the first Muslim country he visited as president. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m trying to make a statement about the importance of Turkey,â\\x80\\x9d he said at the time. Turkey and the United States could â\\x80\\x9cbuild a model partnership,â\\x80\\x9d he added. Mr. Obama believed that Mr. Erdogan, who had risen in politics as a reformer, â\\x80\\x9cwas going to show that you could be democratic and Islamist at the same time,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Gordon said. â\\x80\\x9cHe had a lot of faith in Erdogan he invested in the relationship. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Erdogan, analysts said, had a similar faith in Mr. Obama. He viewed him as a different kind of American leader, one who would not prize relations with Israel and Saudi Arabia above all other countries in the region. Mr. Erdogan was also eager to flex Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s muscles, and Mr. Obama seemed receptive. In 2011, the president spoke more frequently with Mr. Erdogan than with any other foreign leader except Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain. During the early days of the Arab Spring upheavals, in Egypt and Libya, Mr. Obama and Mr. Erdogan were in sync. But the protests in Syria exposed fissures: Mr. Erdogan initially balked at putting pressure on President Bashar   and later worried more about what a fractured Syria would mean for Kurdish nationalism than about the threat of the Islamic State. Although Mr. Obama has periodically warned Mr. Erdogan to curb his authoritarian tendencies  â\\x80\\x94   he called him in June 2013 after the police cracked down brutally on protests in a park near Taksim Square in Istanbul  â\\x80\\x94   the president has generally delivered his criticisms in private. He is likely to do the same this time, analysts said, unless Mr. Erdogan begins executing people. It is a further reflection, they said, of the paucity of options open to Mr. Obama. â\\x80\\x9cWe donâ\\x80\\x99t really have a Plan B,â\\x80\\x9d said Steven A. Cook, an expert on Turkey at the Council on Foreign Relations. â\\x80\\x9cThis is what weâ\\x80\\x99ve got, and weâ\\x80\\x99re going to live with it. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'The nightmare that is Donald Trump just keeps barreling on, and there seems to be no end in sight. In fact, it seems that he just might become the GOP nominee for the 2016 presidential election. There are endless reasons that this is beyond scary, and he has given us yet another.Earlier this week, Trump showed just how ignorant he is of the law in a bumbling interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC s This Week. The host didn t go easy on Trump in a conversation about the Supreme Court and the appointment of justices, and Trump showed himself to be utterly unqualified to be in any position of political power, much less president of the United States and leader of the free world. Here is a transcript of the exchange, courtesy of The New Civil Rights Movement:STEPHANOPOULOS: Let s talk about some of the issues. Judges. What kind of judges will you appoint? Will they be conservative?What does that mean to you and how will you ensure it?TRUMP: Well, first of all, we have a lot of judges that have to be appointed because we have a lot of openings in terms of judges. And I m very happy about that, to be honest, because I think, you know, appointing judges is a very important and a very, frankly, a very, very important element of what we re doing.STEPHANOPOULOS: But Ted Cruz says he s going to appoint rock rib conservatives with a paper trail. What are you going to do?TRUMP: Well, I m going to appoint conservative judges. I m going to appoint people that have great reputations, that are great with the legal profession STEPHANOPOULOS: Like?TRUMP: Well, I can say like any   you know a judge who is a totally underrated and not spoken is Justice Thomas. I mean, if you look at   if you look at some of the judges that we have like on the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts turned out to be a nightmare for conservatives. I mean STEPHANOPOULOS: But how are you going to TRUMP: Wait, let me first say. Ted Cruz, was the one that really wanted Justice Roberts to go on the Supreme Court. You know that, right? Have you heard that?STEPHANOPOULOS: So, how are you going to make sure you don t get a Justice Roberts? Are you going to ask your appointees TRUMP: Well, excuse me, excuse me, how are they going to make sure? Bush appointed him. And Cruz was the biggest advocate. Cruz fought like hell to get Justice Roberts in there. Justice Roberts turned out to be an absolute disaster. He turned out to be an absolute disaster because he gave us Obamacare. So, you tell me, ask Cruz, why did he push STEPHANOPOULOS: I m asking you. How are you going to make sure?TRUMP: No, I m asking you, why did he push so hard to have a judge who has absolutely set the conservative movement back and said everything STEPHANOPOULOS: When I interview him, I ll ask him. How you re going to make sure you don t get betrayed by your appointees.TRUMP: I will study it carefully. I will work with people that I respect, conservative people, and we ll appoint judges that will be good. And I don t think I ll have any catastrophic appointment like Justice Roberts, which was really more than anybody else, pushed by Cruz and Bush.With this level of incompetency on full display for all to see, Trump went on Fox News Sunday to redeem himself on the same issue and this time, he did what every Republican does when trying to woo audiences and cover up for mistakes: he turned the discussion to those Fox viewers hate the most: LGBT people. In fact, Trump says that if he is elected president, the justices on his Supreme Court will be those who oppose marriage equality, and he would find a way to have them throw out the Obergefell v. Hodges decision that made equal marriage the law of the land.First, Trump dodged the question, simply telling host Chris Wallace: They have ruled on it. I wish it was done by the states. Wallace didn t let Trump off the hook though, and plowed on, finally forcing Trump to say to the conservative audience on the issue of justices who would overturn the marriage equality decision: I would strongly consider that, yes. There you have it, folks. We knew Trump was a bigot, but he had never come out and said he d actively work to roll back LGBT right on this level. Not surprising at all, though. Just another reason to make sure his fantasy of ruling America never becomes a reality.Featured image from Gage Skidmore/Flickr',\n",
       " 'MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed allegations Russia had hacked Democratic Party emails as â\\x80\\x9chorror storiesâ\\x80\\x9d dreamt up by U.S. politicians, saying it never interfered in other countriesâ\\x80\\x99 election campaigns. â\\x80\\x9cMoscow is at pains to avoid any words that could be interpreted as direct or indirect interference in the election process,â\\x80\\x9d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters. â\\x80\\x9c... We see that the Russian card is in the red corner on the writing table of all Washington politicians during the election campaign, and that very often they make it a trump card in their game.â\\x80\\x9d Peskov was responding after U.S. President Barack Obama in an interview with NBC News said it was possible Russia would try to influence the U.S. presidential election after a leak of Democratic National Committee emails that experts have blamed on Russian hackers. â\\x80\\x9cThis reminds me of a company where they tell each other horror stories and then start being frightened of their own stories,â\\x80\\x9d said Peskov.

       " 'LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenians vote in a referendum on Sunday on whether the government should pursue construction of a 1-billion-euro ($1.20 billion) railway to its main Adriatic port - a test of the government s popularity ahead of elections next year. Given the opposition s lead in opinion polls and criticism of the project as too expensive, analysts see possible changes in the center-left coalition government ahead of the elections in June or July 2018 if the railway gets a thumbs-down in the referendum.  If (it) is rejected that would be a strong blow to the government, particularly the leading party SMC (Party of the Modern Centre),  Meta Roglic, political analyst at the daily Dnevnik, told Reuters. Opinion polls have forecast varying outcomes of the referendum but suggest turnout might not be sufficient to block the railway project. A poll published by daily Delo said voters would narrowly reject the project, while another released by Dnevnik said voters would back it by a 53-29 percent margin. Under Slovenian law, a minimum 20 percent of some 1.7 million eligible voters would be needed to sink the project, in addition to a majority of those voting. Civil society group Taxpayers Don t Give Up and the leading opposition group, the center-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), pushed for the referendum, saying the railway line as projected by the government is too costly. The government says the 27-km (17-mile) rail link between Koper and the town of Divaca is necessary to speed up freight traffic to and from Slovenia s only port and improve the port s competitiveness. The government has received 44.3 million euros in EU funding for preparation of the track while neighboring Hungary said it is willing to invest about 200 million euros as it relies on Koper for much of its seaborne freight. The opposition SDS has led in opinion polls for most of the past year. But government parties hope to improve their ratings by advancing the railway project, raising family subsidies and the lowest tier of wages, and injecting more money into the state health sector in the coming months.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday released a 58-page draft plan to reverse the landmark 2015 â\\x80\\x9cnet neutralityâ\\x80\\x9d order and disclosed the agency may withdraw â\\x80\\x9cbright lineâ\\x80\\x9d rules barring internet companies from blocking, throttling or giving â\\x80\\x9cfast lanesâ\\x80\\x9d to some websites. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, named by Trump in January, disclosed his intent Wednesday to repeal the Obama era rules that reclassified internet service and tightly regulated providers as if they were utilities. The FCC also plans to scrap the 2015 internet conduct standard and an ombudsman position created to hear complaints of net neutrality violations. The plan asks if network disclosure requirements should remain in force for internet providers. Paiâ\\x80\\x99s plan faces an initial May 18 vote. He wants public comment on whether the FCC should keep its â\\x80\\x9cbright lineâ\\x80\\x9d rules, and said his decision on the rules would depend partly on the comments the agency receives. Websites such as Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and others back the rules, saying they guarantee equal access to the internet. Internet service providers such as AT&T Inc (T.N), Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) oppose the Obama order, saying they made it harder to manage internet traffic and discouraged investment in improving access. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn and Federal Trade Commissioner Terrell McSweeny opposed Paiâ\\x80\\x99s plan, saying it â\\x80\\x9cwould allow broadband providers to erect barriers or charge tolls to any application, connected device, or website that the broadband providersâ\\x80\\x99 customers want to reach. It would allow broadband providers to favor their own content over others, and pick winners and losers on the internet.â\\x80\\x9d Pai said the 2015 open internet rules were unnecessary because large internet providers did not block websites before they were imposed. â\\x80\\x9cWe were not living in some digital dystopia before the partisan imposition of a massive plan hatched in Washington saved all of us,â\\x80\\x9d Pai said Wednesday. The FCC proposal seeks comment â\\x80\\x9con whether a codified no-blocking rule is needed to protect such freedoms.â\\x80\\x9d The order also asks whether a legal bar on throttling â\\x80\\x9cis still necessary, particularly for smaller providers.â\\x80\\x9d The proposal also questions the ban on â\\x80\\x9cpaid prioritizationâ\\x80\\x9d that the proposal argues was adopted to â\\x80\\x9caddress an apparently nonexistent problem.â\\x80\\x9d AT&T said the question â\\x80\\x9cis not whether the internet will remain open - it undoubtedly will. The question is how, as a country, we will regulate the internet ecosystem.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",

       " 'CARACAS (Reuters) - Laughing at their own tribulations, Venezuelan theatergoers have been enjoying a new satire about a senior official who broke with President Nicolas Maduro and fled the socialist-ruled country in a boat.  Former chief state prosecutor Luisa Ortega has been one of the protagonists in this year s political crisis in Venezuela, denouncing rights abuses and corruption before finally going into hiding and moving to Colombia in mid-August.  Dressed in a blonde wig and Ortega s trademark office suit, actress Mercedes Benmoha recreates some well-known scenes - and imagines others - in a 15-minute show called  The Prosecutor,  which is proving popular at a small venue in a mall.  Benmoha, who happens to be a lawyer like her subject, acts out a news conference and an imaginary phone call with Ortega s nemesis, state election board head and diehard Maduro ally Tibisay Lucena. She also recreates the once-powerful Ortega s attempt to re-enter her office after authorities fired her and security forces surrounded the building.  Jokes fly about corruption, Maduro, and Ortega s own precipitous fall from power.   We use humor as a defense mechanism,  Benmoha, 35, told Reuters on Friday night, minutes before going on stage for her sellout show.  It s our way to survive, to breathe, to entertain ourselves but also to reflect.   Venezuelans have had little to laugh about this year. A fourth year of recession and runaway inflation have pummeled households, with shortages and hunger widespread.  Months of opposition-led protests led to about 130 deaths and thousands of injuries.  Having first fled to Aruba in a speedboat, Ortega has been traveling round Latin America denouncing the Maduro government, which in turn has accused her of corruption. While Venezuela s opposition has applauded her stance against Maduro, activists also remember she was until recently a pillar of the socialist government and that her office had spearheaded its jailing of political foes. Benmoha, who co-wrote the script for her show, said she watched more than 800 videos of Ortega to study her gestures and mannerisms. But with her subject still making news almost daily, the play is regularly updated.  When the show started in early August, a producer actually invited Ortega, but she was never able to attend.  After Ortega left the country, however, one of her assistants sent a  Lady Justice  statue that had been in her office. Now, it adorns a Caracas stage every night.      ',\n",
       " 'JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia said on Monday it had made urgent requests for an explanation why its military chief was barred from traveling to the United States, as anger simmered in the world s largest Muslim-majority country over the diplomatic incident. Armed forces commander General Gatot Nurmantyo was stopped on Saturday from boarding an Emirates flight to the United States, despite having a visa and an official invitation to a conference from his counterpart, the chairman of the U.S joint chiefs of staff, General Joseph Dunford. Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said she had accepted an official apology from the deputy U.S. ambassador in Jakarta but awaited a detailed explanation.  We conveyed that we still await clarification, an explanation why this happened,  Marsudi told reporters after meeting the U.S. envoy.  There is a sense of urgency to this that we have conveyed to them,  she said, adding that U.S. officials were  trying to coordinate with relevant authorities in the U.S. to find out what really happened.  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis apologized for the incident to his Indonesian counterpart, Ryamizard Ryacudu, on the sidelines of an ASEAN meeting in the Philippines, and the two were photographed shaking hands.  I can confirm that he did a pull-aside with the Indonesian minister and expressed regret and apologized for the inconvenience,  Captain Jeff Davis, a spokesman for Mattis, told Reuters.  In a statement, the U.S. embassy in Jakarta said:  This issue has been resolved. There is no restriction on General Gatot s travel and we look forward to welcoming (him) to the United States.       Indonesia generally enjoys good ties with the United States. But relations have sometimes been strained over U.S. resource companies operating in Indonesia or alleged rights abuses involving Indonesia s military. It was not immediately clear whether Nurmantyo, who has made official visits to the United States before, would attend the conference as scheduled on Monday and Tuesday. In Washington, U.S. Homeland Security Department spokesman Dave Lapan said the U.S. embassy in Jakarta had told Nurmantyo s office that he might be delayed in boarding his flight because of unspecified  U.S. security protocols.  Lapan said the U.S. government was unable to resolve the problem before Nurmantyo arrived at the airport and he was denied boarding. The general was eventually cleared and booked on another flight but  he chose not to travel,  Lapan added.  The U.S. government is dedicated to ensuring that all persons traveling to the United States are screened and properly vetted. We regret that the passenger and his wife were inconvenienced,  Lapan said in an emailed statement. The spokesman declined to respond to a question about the security protocols that led to Nurmantyo being denied boarding, saying:  We re not able to discuss the specifics of individual cases.  Some Indonesians reacted indignantly to the incident, putting up banners around the capital calling for the U.S. ambassador to be expelled and for Americans to be  sent home .  Former Indonesian Ambassador to the United States Dino Patti Djalal called for a stronger government reaction.   The government should not be asking for a clarification, but rather conveying a protest to the U.S. side,  he said on Twitter. Nurmantyo has frequently courted controversy in Indonesia over what analysts perceive to be his political ambitions. He has been accused of whipping up nationalist sentiment by promoting the notion that Indonesia is besieged by  proxy wars  waged by foreign states looking to undermine the country.  This month, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said the armed forces should stay out of politics and ensure their loyalty was only to the state and the government - a statement many believed referred to Nurmantyo s actions. Nurmantyo is due to retire next March and many expect him to run for vice president or even president in 2019. ',\n",

He wants to put a stop to that.In an interview with Miami s WFOR, Trump was asked by the reporter if it should be easier to sue media and whether the First Amendment provides  too much protection. Trump didn t specifically say  yes,  but he did talk about England.Well in England they have a system where you can actually sue if someone says something wrong. Our press is allowed to say whatever they want and get away with it. And i think we should go to a system where if they do something wrong  I m a big believer tremendous believer of the freedom of the press. Nobody believes it stronger than me but if they make terrible, terrible mistakes and those mistakes are made on purpose to injure people. I m not just talking about me I m talking anybody else then yes, i think you should have the ability to sue them.Here s the video:Let s recap that for a moment.

Unfortunately for him, though, public figures, especially those running for public office, have a much harder time winning a libel suit, although if a publication knowingly writes incorrect and damaging information, he can sue.The problem for Trump, though, is that the media hasn t lied about him. They quote him directly, which for a man who clearly can t control what comes out of his mouth, is a problem.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images.',\n",
       " 'During a segment of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver discussed the issue of voter disenfranchisement. Republicans have everything to gain by making it harder to vote.One of the hot button issues of the day is Republicans  creation of laws that force people to have valid identification when they vote. The genius behind the plan is that it seems so innocent to require people to show identification in order to vote. However, it has been shown that it can be far harder to have all the valid identification that some states are now requiring than one might think. Oliver notes how hard it can be just to get an ID due to the times that ID-issuing offices are closed: And in some parts of the country, the offices that issue IDs are hardly ever open. In 2012, a study found that in Wisconsin, Alabama and Mississippi, fewer than half of all ID-issuing offices in the state are open five days a week. And in Sauk City, Wisconsin the ID office is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month   and only four months in 2016 even have five Wednesdays,  Oliver says.Those Republicans wish to see vote the least are minority voters, who traditionally back Democratic candidates. That s why during the segment, John Oliver points out how much these anti-democratic schemes disproportionately hurt Black and Latino voters. Studies have shown these restrictions tend to disproportionately impact African-American and Latino voters. In Texas, for instance, experts found that African-American voters were nearly twice as likely to lack voter ID, and Latinos were nearly two and a half times as likely. It s just one of those things that white people seem to be more likely to have, like a sunburn or an Oscar nomination,  says Oliver.The Republican Party is dying due to demographic and ideological changes. Instead of changing their Party s platform, they would rather sink to these pathetic voter disenfranchisement schemes.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot',\n",
       " 'â\\x80¢ Hurricane Matthew, a deadly storm with maximum sustained winds of more than 110 miles per hour, was forecast to start inflicting significant rain and wind damage in southern Florida beginning late Thursday, and in Georgia by late Friday, with the storm expected to strengthen to Category 4 from Category 3 as it approaches Florida. Coverage continues here &gt&gt â\\x80¢ â\\x80\\x9cHurricane conditionsâ\\x80\\x9d are expected in much of the Bahamas Lake Okeechobee, Fla. and a long coastal stretch of the United States that includes Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton, West Palm Beach and St. Augustine in Florida, and Jekyll Island off Georgia, the National Hurricane Center announced at 5 a. m. The eye of the storm was expected to pass near Grand Bahama Island late Thursday and move â\\x80\\x9cvery close to the east coast of the Florida peninsulaâ\\x80\\x9d Thursday evening through Friday night. â\\x80¢ The governors of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared emergencies, and more than 7, 800 National Guard soldiers were activated or placed on alert. â\\x80¢ New York Times journalists assigned to cover the storm include Azam Ahmed, Mexico City bureau chief Lizette Alvarez in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Nick Madigan in Miami Frances Robles in Cocoa Beach, Fla. Les Neuhaus in Jacksonville, Fla. Alan Blinder in Atlanta Richard Fausset in Charleston, S. C. and Jess Bidgood in Wilmington, N. C. Gov. Rick Scott warned Floridians that the storm was expected to skim the stateâ\\x80\\x99s Atlantic coastline so closely that a direct hit could not be ruled out. â\\x80\\x9cWe have to be prepared to be hit by a catastrophic hurricane,â\\x80\\x9d he warned at a news briefing at the stateâ\\x80\\x99s Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee Wednesday morning. Hurricane Matthew, he said, was packing enough strength to cause the kind of â\\x80\\x9cmassive destruction we havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen in years. â\\x80\\x9d A hurricane warning was in effect for nearly 260 miles along the Interstate 95 corridor from the northern edge of   County to the Daytona Beach area. Mr. Scott urged residents to drive inland. â\\x80\\x9cIt could be the biggest evacuation ever,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Mandatory evacuations for the barrier islands in the hurricane warning areas were to begin Thursday at 8 a. m. The governor also pleaded with residents to start leaving early, before traffic backs up. â\\x80\\x9cWe have less than 24 hours left to prepare, evacuate and shelter,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cHaving a plan in place would be the difference of life and death. â\\x80\\x9d Up and down the coast, Florida residents raced to make final preparations. Lines at gas stations stretched far beyond the pumps. Supermarkets were depleted of bottled water, bread and canned goods as people waited patiently to pay up and get out. Planters and lawn furniture were being hustled inside. Flashlights were put within easy reach, and windows and glass doors were shielded by dusty hurricane shutters. Students, most of them too young to remember the danger of powerful hurricanes, celebrated the announcement that schools would close from along coastal counties from Miami to Jacksonville on Thursday and Friday.  â\\x80\\x94   LIZETTE ALVAREZ Jami Baker, 29, a Florida native who lives in a   apartment in Miamiâ\\x80\\x99s Brickell neighborhood, a few blocks from the waters of Biscayne Bay, spent part of Wednesday stocking up on water, wine and crackers. â\\x80\\x9cEveryone is in serious prep mode,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Ms. Bakerâ\\x80\\x99s mother is 60 years old and her father is a decade older. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m concerned about my parents, who are in Boca Raton, where theyâ\\x80\\x99ll be getting the storm much worse,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll be a nervous wreck if cell service goes out and I canâ\\x80\\x99t reach them. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Baker, a public relations executive, said she had two other concerns: losing electrical power, and the fact that in her neighborhood, several   building projects are underway. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m surrounded by cranes and construction materials that are seemingly loose. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure these construction firms have storm protocol, but itâ\\x80\\x99s been a while since we had a major storm. â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   NICK MADIGAN Even people not directly in the stormâ\\x80\\x99s path can be badly affected by its intensity, said Leanne Tellam, a    resident of Palmetto Bay, a Miami suburb, who went through Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and what she called the â\\x80\\x9ctrifectaâ\\x80\\x9d of storms in 2005. â\\x80\\x9cHurricane Matthew does pose a tremendous threat to the entire east coast of Florida,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cif not from direct winds or storm surge, then from the psychological factors at play that cause rational people to clear shelves of bottled water in areas where the tap water is safe to drink, or to empty out gas stations. The balance of being prepared and being rational are blurred when you have a storm this big. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Tellam, who moved to Miami from New Jersey with her parents when she was 2, tends to take such storms somewhat in stride. â\\x80\\x9cI have learned that I have enough in my house to withstand the loss of power for up to five days,â\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Tellam, who lives with her husband, Douglas, their three children and two dogs. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve spent a great deal of time in the Bahamas and am really worried about what the storm surge and waves will do to my friends on the   places where there is no high ground when facing a storm like this,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x94   NICK MADIGAN Gov. Nikki R. Haley urged people to evacuate Charleston, the stateâ\\x80\\x99s   city, as the hurricane threatened millions of people along the East Coast. She said that the evacuation of Charleston and part of its surrounding area would begin at 3 p. m. Wednesday, and that the authorities would reverse eastbound lanes on Interstate 26. Other areas of the South Carolina coast will be evacuated on Thursday morning, the governor said. â\\x80\\x9cFor those of you that are wondering whether you should leave or not, I again will tell you that if you do not leave, you are putting a law enforcement officer or a National Guardsmanâ\\x80\\x99s life on the line when they have to go back and get you,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Haley said, She estimated that the evacuation would affect about 250, 000 residents and countless tourists.  â\\x80\\x94   ALAN BLINDER On Wednesday afternoon, the Walmart in North Charleston, S. C. was a predictable hive of commerce, of necessities purchased by the case. By 1:30 p. m. the water was almost all gone. There would be diapers enough for only a few babies more. The sound system played â\\x80\\x9cA Horse With No Name. â\\x80\\x9d Shoppers and their carts jostled in the food aisles. Maynard Terry, 40, had five cases of bottled water in a cart, along with his girlfriendâ\\x80\\x99s    daughter. Mr. Terry said they could not leave town, because his girlfriendâ\\x80\\x99s elderly grandmother refused. And someone needed to care for her. â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s in poor health and sheâ\\x80\\x99s stubborn and she donâ\\x80\\x99t want to go,â\\x80\\x9d he said. He smiled, and said they were going to make the most of it. Soon everything would be closed. Soon there would be no distraction but the storm. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re just going to chill,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s going to be family time. â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   RICHARD FAUSSET Hundreds of yellow public school buses snaked around the massive complex housing the North Charleston Coliseum and the Charleston Area Convention Center in this suburb of South Carolinaâ\\x80\\x99s   city, preparing to haul the elderly, the poor and those without cars  â\\x80\\x94   or without a friend to drive them  â\\x80\\x94   away from the Lowcountry before Hurricane Matthew struck. The buses were to leave at 3 p. m. and take the evacuees to Greenville, S. C. Jacqueline Holmes and her husband, Andrew, both 54, had come three hours early, with bags full of chips, water, deodorant and flushable wipes. Ms. Holmesâ\\x80\\x99s previous trips to the coliseum were for leisure. She saw Barry White in concert here, and Luther Vandross, and LL Cool J. In 1989, she also saw Hurricane Hugo lay waste to large parts of the Charleston area. She rode out that infamous storm in her parentsâ\\x80\\x99 house. â\\x80\\x9cIt was the most terriblest thing I ever saw,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Holmes said, as she walked along the asphalt toward a staging area in front of the convention center. Ms. Holmes, who speaks with the almost Caribbean Gullah lilt that distinguishes the speech of many   here, recalled, as if it were yesterday, the quiet before Hurricane Hugo hit, and the moment when the silence was shattered by a violent roar that sounded like a freight train coming. She remembers the trees yanked up along with their roots, strewn around her parentsâ\\x80\\x99 yard.  â\\x80\\x94   RICHARD FAUSSET President Obama urged people in coastal states to prepare. â\\x80\\x9cWe anticipate that not only is there still a chance that the core of the storm strikes Florida and some of the states further north, but even if you donâ\\x80\\x99t get the full force of the hurricane, we are still going to be seeing tropical force winds, the potential for a storm surge,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said Wednesday morning at the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. â\\x80\\x9cAnd all of that could have a devastating effect. â\\x80\\x9d The president, who postponed a Wednesday visit to Florida as the stormâ\\x80\\x99s path became clearer, said residents should be ready to flee with little warning. â\\x80\\x9cNow is the time for you to prepare in the event that you have to evacuate,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said. Even if residents are not ordered to leave, he said, â\\x80\\x9cit still makes sense for you to figure out what kind of plan do you have, what kind of preparations and supplies do you have. â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   ALAN BLINDER In North Carolina, officials ordered the evacuation of Ocracoke Island, a popular destination for tourists in the Outer Banks. The storm is set to press through the Bahamas on Thursday, slowly passing over a large part of the islands with violent wind and rain, in addition to storm surges. It is expected to strike as a Category 3 hurricane, bringing a potential for   to   surge in water and more than a foot of rain, a combination that could lead to heavy flooding. â\\x80\\x9cOver the coming hours, days, weeks and months, if the forecasts are correct, Hurricane Matthew may well become a defining event in our countryâ\\x80\\x99s history,â\\x80\\x9d Prime Minister Perry Christie said. â\\x80\\x9cIt is rare that the whole country will have been impacted so directly by a storm of such magnitude and severity. â\\x80\\x9d Infrastructure in the Bahamas, thanks to the heavy tourism industry, is likely to fare better than that of Haiti and Eastern Cuba, where the storm devastated stretches of the island, leaving massive flooding or piles of rubble in its wake. Hotels and other structures are better equipped, in many cases, to withstand the battering of wind and rain. All the same, the State Department has issued travel warnings asking travelers to avoid visiting the Bahamas as well as Turks and Caicos.  â\\x80\\x94   AZAM AHMED Initial reports from the government of Haiti said that five people there had been killed, 10 people had been injured and one person was missing. The storm pummeled the southern coast on Tuesday, destroying homes and crops, sweeping away livestock and cutting off transportation as a large part of the Caribbean was pummeled by     winds and torrential rain. The top United Nations official in Haiti, Mourad Wahba, described the storm as â\\x80\\x9cthe largest humanitarian eventâ\\x80\\x9d in the country of 11 million since a devastating earthquake six years ago, with thousands scrambling for shelter. Haitiâ\\x80\\x99s civil protection agency said a bridge collapse had severed the main highway connecting the south with    the capital. Interior Minister FranÃ§ois Anick Joseph said Tuesday night that 14, 530 people had been evacuated and that about 2, 200 homes were flooded or destroyed. As of Wednesday morning, the storm, which was downgraded to Category 3, from Category 4, had passed through Cuba, and the National Hurricane Center in Miami warned that a dangerous surge was beginning to spread over the Bahamas, to the north.  â\\x80\\x94   AZAM AHMED John Schwartz, a New York Times reporter who covers climate change and the environment, is answering reader questions about the storm. John rode out his first hurricane, Carla, in his hometown, Galveston, Tex. at the age of 4. He has covered the aftermath of Katrina, as well as other storms for The Times.  Ask your hurricane questions here.  When was the last big storm to hit Florida, and how does this compare? If Matthew hits Florida directly, it will be the first major hurricane to do so since Wilma in 2005, which caused damage estimated at $21 billion. How will Matthew compare? As the National Hurricane Center put it Thursday evening, â\\x80\\x9cWhen a hurricane is forecast to take a track roughly parallel to a coastline, as Matthew is forecast to do from Florida through South Carolina, it becomes very difficult to estimate impacts this far in advance. â\\x80\\x9d But Florida, especially, has been warned to batten down, and much of the East Coast is preparing for powerful winds and storm surge as well as torrential rain. Hi, John. Is it safe to visit my mother in Chestertown, Md.? Will we have a problem finding gasoline? Will the roads be blocked with displaced people, flooding and debris?  â\\x80\\x94   Dan Wyatt Dan, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard of no evacuation order there yet, and with the storm likely to be turning to the east in the next few days, the risk to the town could be diminishing. But hurricanes often spread well beyond the edges of the cone, and so your mother could expect high winds, a ton of rain to deal with, and the usual run on supplies. If you do go, itâ\\x80\\x99s a good idea to fill the gas tank before you head out. And keep an eye on the storm predictions from the National Hurricane Center. You can register to receive Kent County, Md. evacuation alerts and other emergency messages here. I live in Jacksonville, N. C. Should we be looking to evacuate anytime soon?  â\\x80\\x94   Jamelia Hello, Jamelia! The risk to coastal towns in North Carolina has lessened a bit in the October 5   forecast released at 2 p. m. which you can see here: As you can see, the National Hurricane Center is suggesting that a few days from now the storm will take a sharp turn to the east, which could still mean Jacksonville would avoid a direct hit but could still feel effects of storm surge and heavy rains. Your best bet is to look to local authorities for alerts about whether or not to evacuate. At the same time, itâ\\x80\\x99s a good time to sit down and figure out what your evacuation plan would be, if necessary  â\\x80\\x94   know the local hurricane evacuation routes, and figure out where youâ\\x80\\x99ll go while waiting for the storm to pass. And if a call for evacuation does come, take it seriously. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s a great page from Ready. gov with good advice about how to prepare for evacuation. The maps appear to show prediction that the hurricane will make a radical turn to the right, to the east, out to sea. Why is that predicted? Are probabilities given that instead it may follow a more common path up the coast?  â\\x80\\x94   Dick Purcell There are a number of factors at play here, Dick, including potential interactions with Tropical Storm Nicole over the weekend. A meteorologist, Ryan Maue, put out a lovely tweet earlier today showing the dance with Nicole: The National Hurricane Center notes in its 11 a. m. discussion of Matthew that the subtropical ridge over the western Atlantic could head east and push Matthew east and even south. But itâ\\x80\\x99s too early to say where this thing is going with any certainty, so keep watching Matthew at the National Hurricane Center, or your favorite source of weather news.',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White supremacists and neo-Nazis have rarely, if ever, in recent history been so enthusiastic about a presidential appointment as Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s choice of Steve Bannon to be his chief White House strategist. Before he took over as chief executive of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign in August and led it to victory last week, Bannon headed Breitbart News, a website and voice for the alt-right movement, a loose right-wing confederation that includes hardcore nationalists, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. Five days after Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump rewarded Bannon, 62, a former Goldman Sachs banker and a Navy veteran, by appointing him senior counselor and chief strategist - jobs not subject to U.S. Senate confirmation.  Democrats, rights activists and minority groups were outraged and said Trump, himself accused of racism and misogyny during the campaign, had just flung open the White House doors to hatemongers. Many urged him to reconsider. â\\x80\\x9cBringing Steve Bannon into the White House is an alarming signal that President-elect Trump remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign,â\\x80\\x9d House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on Monday. â\\x80\\x9cThere must be no sugar-coating the reality that a white nationalist has been named chief strategist for the Trump administration,â\\x80\\x9d Pelosi said. The Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League and the Council on Americanâ\\x80\\x93Islamic Relations (CAIR) also denounced Bannon. Bannon, who grew up in a Democratic family, has a reputation of trying to tear down a Republican Party establishment that he deemed too soft and too entrenched. As a senior adviser to the Republican Trump, Bannon will be expected by far-right groups to champion their views and make sure that Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, keeps such campaign promises as building a wall on the southern U.S. border, cracking down on Muslims entering the country and restricting the influx of Syrian war refugees. â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps â\\x80\\x98The Donaldâ\\x80\\x99 is for real,â\\x80\\x9d Rocky Suhayda, chairman of the American Nazi Party, told CNN. David Duke, a longtime leader of Ku Klux Klan movements, and Richard Spencer, a white nationalist who runs the National Policy Institute, were among the leading alt-right figures to praise Bannonâ\\x80\\x99s appointment. In remarks published in the New York Times on Tuesday, Bannon ascribed his interest in populism and American nationalism to a desire to curb what he views as the corrosive effects of globalization. He rejected what he called the â\\x80\\x9cethno-nationalistâ\\x80\\x9d tendencies of some in the movement. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not that some people on the margins, as in any movement, arenâ\\x80\\x99t bad guys - racists, anti-Semites. But thatâ\\x80\\x99s irrelevant,â\\x80\\x9d he told the Times. Political commentator Armstrong Willliams, a close associate of former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, said Bannon was â\\x80\\x9cone of the finest and most honorable people Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever metâ\\x80\\x9d and not bigoted in any way.  The Trump campaign had been struggling to manage Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s unconventional candidacy when Bannon took over. He stayed behind the scenes and devised the strategy for the final days of the campaign that kept Trump on message and enabled him to upset Clinton in crucial states such as Michigan. It was Bannon and Jared Kushner, Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s son-in-law, who invited three women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault to attend a presidential debate in hopes of unnerving Hillary Clinton. Bannon, looking typically unkempt with mussed hair and stubbly chin, grinned from the back of the room as Trump and the women held their pre-debate news conference. â\\x80\\x9cBannon is a legitimately sinister figure,â\\x80\\x9d Ben Shapiro, who had been editor-in-chief of Breitbart under Bannon, wrote in August on the dailywire.com conservative news website which he founded.  â\\x80\\x9cHe is a vindictive, nasty figure ... He will attempt to ruin anyone who impedes his unending ambition and he will use anyone bigger than he is - for example, Donald Trump - to get where he wants to go,â\\x80\\x9d Shapiro wrote. ANTI-SEMITISM ACCUSATIONS While Bannon was at Breitbart, it had stories with headlines such as â\\x80\\x9cBirth control makes women unattractive and crazy,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPolitical correctness protects Muslim rape cultureâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cHoist it high and proud: The Confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage.â\\x80\\x9d The siteâ\\x80\\x99s pro-Trump agenda featured speculative stories questioning Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s health and accusing her close aide Huma Abedin of being a Saudi spy. Bannon was charged with domestic violence and battery in 1996 after his then-wife, Mary Louise Piccard, said he grabbed her by the throat and arm during an argument. The case was dropped when she did not appear in court. In 2007 Piccard said in court documents Bannon did not like the school the girls attended because it had too many â\\x80\\x9cwhiny bratâ\\x80\\x9d Jewish students. Bannon had a varied and profitable career before joining Breitbart. He earned degrees from Virginia Tech, Georgetown University and Harvard Business School and served four years in the Navy. It was his Navy experience, he said, that led him to shed his familyâ\\x80\\x99s Democratic allegiance and become an admirer of Republican Ronald Reagan. He was at Goldman Sachs before starting his own investment firm, which specialized in media. Through negotiating a studio sale, he obtained a stake in the royalties for the popular television show â\\x80\\x9cSeinfeld,â\\x80\\x9d a money-making powerhouse in syndication. He was an executive producer of the feature movies â\\x80\\x9cTitusâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cThe Indian Runnerâ\\x80\\x9d before producing, directing or writing conservative-oriented documentaries such as â\\x80\\x9cClinton Cashâ\\x80\\x9d about the Clinton Foundation, â\\x80\\x9cGeneration Zeroâ\\x80\\x9d about the global economic crisis of 2008-2009 and â\\x80\\x9cThe Undefeatedâ\\x80\\x9d on former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.

       " 'ROME (AFP)  â\\x80\\x94   The Italian government said Sunday that dozens of rival tribes in southern Libya had agreed to cooperate on securing the countryâ\\x80\\x99s borders in an effort to curb the influx of migrants trying to reach Europe. [Italyâ\\x80\\x99s interior ministry said the 60 tribal leaders  â\\x80\\x94   notably the Tuareg of the southwest, the Toubou of the southeast, and the Arab tribe of Awlad Suleiman  â\\x80\\x94   had reached the   deal after 72 hours of secret talks in Rome.  A representative from Libyaâ\\x80\\x99s   Government of National Accord, which is based in Tripoli and controls western Libya, was also present. â\\x80\\x9cA Libyan border patrol unit will be operational to monitor Libyaâ\\x80\\x99s southern border of 5, 000 kilometres (3, 100 miles),â\\x80\\x9d Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti told Italyâ\\x80\\x99s La Stampa newspaper, one of several Italian media outlets reporting on the deal Sunday. â\\x80\\x9cSecuring Libyaâ\\x80\\x99s southern border means securing Europeâ\\x80\\x99s southern border,â\\x80\\x9d Minniti said. Southern Libya is   by smuggling routes for people, drugs and weapons. Since the 2011 uprising that ousted Moamer Kadhafi, a mosaic of tribal and ethnic forces is fighting for control of illicit trade and oil fields in the region. Tuaregs control the border with southern Algeria, while further east, the Toubou operate along the borders with Chad and Sudan. Arab tribes in the region have supported the authorities in western Libya, but they also maintain ties with a rival administration that holds sway in the east  â\\x80\\x94   and regularly clash with the Toubou. Fayez   chief of the fragile GNA, has struggled to impose the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s authority, despite its backing by many political and military leaders. The accord, whose details have not yet been released, is the latest in a series of deals European countries have sought to reduce migration from Libya, which has increased sharply in recent months. The deal aims to combat â\\x80\\x9can economy based on illicit drugs, which causes hundreds of deaths in the Mediterranean, thousands of desperate people looking for a better life, a populist push (in Europe) and a jihadist threat in the desert,â\\x80\\x9d according to the text of the agreement, quoted in the Corriere della Sera newspaper. It also calls for job training programmes to keep young people from criminal activities. Some 24, 200 people have been rescued from the Mediterranean and registered at Italian ports so far this year, according to the Interior Ministry. As part of an earlier agreement with the European Union, about 90 members of the Libyan coastguard are currently completing training under the EU, and Italy is preparing to return 10 coastguard boats to Libya that it seized in 2011. They are expected to be operational by the end of April or in early May. In March, interior ministers from several EU and North African countries reached a deal with the GNA to stem flow of migrant and human smuggling, which included pledges of money, coastguard training and equipment for Libya.',\n",

       " 'MADRID (Reuters) - A judge will give his ruling on Monday on whether eight pro-independence Catalan politicians charged with sedition should be released from custody so they can contest a regional election set for Dec. 21, judicial sources said on Friday.  The eight, former members of Catalonia s dismissed regional government, appeared before the Supreme Court on Friday to request their release while they await trial in the wake of a disputed independence referendum. Catalan leaders, who previously held a slim parliamentary majority, made a unilateral declaration of independence in defiance of Spanish law on Oct. 27, leading to their arrest and forcing Madrid to take direct control of the region and call the election. The face-off between Barcelona and Madrid has tipped Spain into its worst political crisis in four decades, prompted more than 2,800 companies to move their legal headquarters out of the region, and forced the government to cut growth forecasts. It has also deeply divided people in the wealthy northeastern region and caused resentment in the rest of Spain. Sacked regional vice-president Oriol Junqueras, one of his ERC party s main candidates for the election, has asked to leave jail in order to campaign in the December vote, which pro-independence parties see as a de facto vote on secession. The presiding judge will make his decision on the cabinet members  custody public on Monday, judicial sources said. Any release would likely to be on bail and under strict conditions as the defendants await trial.    Junqueras and seven other former cabinet members were jailed on Nov. 2 pending trial on charges of sedition, rebellion and misappropriation of funds after organizing the illegal secession vote and declaring independence from Spain. Earlier in November, the Supreme Court released Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell on bail of 150,000 euros  ($178,410) after she agreed to renounce any political activity that went against the Spanish constitution. All eight former cabinet members have said they would abide by a ruling giving Madrid control over the region, according to their lawyers, although some of them said they did not agree with this unprecedented move stripping power from the rebel administration. Campaigning for the Dec. 21 election officially starts on Tuesday. The former president of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, in self-imposed exile in Belgium and subject to an arrest warrant from Spain for rebellion and misuse of public funds, has called the elections the most important in the region s history. Barely a quarter of Catalans want to continue with the project of creating an independent state, a survey by pollsters Metroscopia showed. However, the same poll of 1,800 Catalans taken between Nov. 20 and Nov. 22, showed that separatist parties are forecast to win 46 percent of the vote, down slightly from 47.7 percent in a previous election in 2015.  Unionist parties combined would account for another 46 percent of votes, up from less than 40 percent last time. The leaders of Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana (ANC) and Omnium Cultural, Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart   who were imprisoned last month, also testified before the Supreme Court over their role in the independence drive.

       " 'A beautiful story of generosity and kindness the media would never share with American voters One narrative emerging around the surprisingly resilient Donald Trump portrays the brash billionaire as a final card laid down by Republican blue-collar voters who see their way of life   and their political clout   draining away in a bathtub spiral.Trump has been a man of last resort before. Right here in Georgia, in fact. And if his Republican presidential machine doesn t seize upon the tale in the next few weeks, as he and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas battle for Southern votes, then someone in the Trump campaign will be guilty of gross incompetence.It happened in 1986, in the midst of the worst farm crisis since the Great Depression. In Burke County, on Georgia s eastern border, farm after farm was folding.On Feb. 4, Lenard Dozier Hill III, a third-generation occupant of his cotton-and-soybean acreage, was about to have his land sold out from under him.  That morning, it was going to be auctioned off at the courthouse steps, so he committed suicide,  said Betsy Sharp, his daughter.In the bedroom of the Hill home, along with the .22-caliber rifle that did the work, was a neat stack of life insurance policies and other papers on the nightstand. Hill had intended for the life insurance payout to cover most of his $300,000 debt and so save the family farm for another generation.It was a grievous miscalculation. Most, if not all, life insurance policies include a clause that prohibits payment in cases of suicide.  He didn t realize all that,  Sharp said.Hill s desperate act struck a chord. Reporters and TV crews descended on the Waynesboro church where the funeral was held. Vandals painted  farmer killer  on the door of the local bank.Once the family realized the financial futility of Hill s suicide, the burden of saving the farm fell on his widow, Annabel Hill, a 66-year-old teacher and social worker with gray hair and large glasses.The widow was already familiar with Frank Argenbright, a wealthy and white Atlanta businessman who had made a name for himself by organizing the successful effort to save the farm of a black farmer in Cochran named Oscar Lorick.(Argenbright initially tried to do this anonymously, as a masked benefactor who called himself  A.N. American.  But he was the head of a growing security firm, and his cop friends recognized his voice.)Argenbright arranged a press conference for Annabel Hill in Atlanta.  It went national,  he said. Today, in the age of the Internet, we use the term  viral. Then, as now, clowns came out of the woodwork. In an interview, Argenbright said one of the first calls he received was from a Texas oilman who wanted to come to Atlanta to help.  For some reason I had to pay the ticket,  Argenbright said. First class.The  oilman  turned out to be a soused escapee from a rehab unit for alcoholics. Argenbright put him on the next flight back to Texas. In coach.Above is a video, featuring Betsy Sharp, daughter of Lenard and Annabel Hill, put together by Chad Etheridge of Growing America, a news service for farmers.***Argenbright was still at the airport when his assistant called. Someone claiming to be Donald Trump had just rang, offering to help Annabel Hill.A suspicious Argenbright called the number and demanded proof of identity from the man who answered. Herschel Walker works for me,  the voice said. The former University of Georgia running back was the star of the New Jersey Generals, a United States Football League team owned by Trump. That was good enough. Well, Mr. Trump, I apologize,  Argenbright said.Trump told the Atlanta businessman that his wife, Ivana, had seen the report on the Hill family s plight on the network news, and she suggested that he get involved. The magnate summoned Argenbright and the Hills to New York. After a brief interview, Trump signed onto the cause.Accounts of what followed differ. In his book  The Art of the Deal,  Trump wrote that, in a phone call, he twisted the arm of a vice president of the Georgia bank that held the Hill mortgage. I said to the guy,  You listen to me. If you do foreclose, I ll bring a lawsuit for murder against you and your bank, on the grounds that you harassed Mrs. Hill s husband to his death.  All of a sudden, the banker sounded very nervous and said he d get right back to me. Sometimes it pays to be a little wild,  Trump wrote.Problem solved.Argenbright, a Trump admirer who would go on to provide security at many of the billionaire s properties, describes a Trump who was far less sure of himself   and of the public reaction that would follow. And quieter, too.  It wasn t the Donald that you see now,  Argenbright said.  He wasn t sure that people would respond to him. He didn t want to be embarrassed. Trump provided $20,000 to stave off foreclosure of the Hill farm, but his name was initially kept out of the picture. During a press conference on the courthouse steps in Waynesboro announcing the delay, Argenbright said he spoke only of support from  a New York developer. But Trump s identity was easily and quickly guessed. The billionaire and the Georgia farm wife made the rounds of the morning TV shows. Viewers were asked to send their dollars to the  Annabel Hill Fund, Trump Towers, New York, 10022. Money poured in, but Trump and a Texas oilman   a real one, this time   provided the last $78,000. A  mortgage-burning  ceremony was scheduled for two days before Christmas. The Hill family was again flown to New York, at Trump s expense. I had just graduated from high school. He flew us to New York, and we went to Trump Towers and had breakfast with him,  said Betsy Sharp, who is now 49 and lives in Augusta. We saw a whole different side of him that was kindhearted, to reach out to us, to help us,  the daughter said.  Most people don t know and see that side. All they see is just the  blurt  that people put on the TV. They don t see the other side of him, and that s what my family got to experience. Argenbright feels likewise.  He couldn t have been nicer. He took care of them and stayed in touch with them after that,  Argenbright said.  He had no ulterior motive. But Argenbright said that, in advance of that mortgage-burning ceremony in 1986, he did catch a glimpse of the media-savvy presidential candidate that we are watching now.Trump ordered the waterfalls in his towers turned off, to make it easier for the TV sound technicians. He made sure that at least three tested cigarette lighters were on hand to spark the fire. The mortgage papers were fake, but Trump ordered an assistant to light one up to make sure they would burn quickly and dramatically, said Argenbright, who supplied an engraved tray from Tiffany s for the ashes. Just to watch how detailed he was in understanding the perception of the moment and how significant it was   it was a special time,  Argenbright said.  He was an honorable guy who wanted to do the right thing. If it wasn t for him, that farm wouldn t have been saved. The Annabel Hill episode was just a small piece of the farm crisis. In the two months that followed, 85 other farms in Burke County alone were scheduled for foreclosure. Other celebrities attempted rescues as well   Willie Nelson s series of Farm Aid concerts had begun the year before.But this was the moment that Donald Trump, who had already put his name on the New York City skyline, introduced himself to rural America.

       " 'NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s election board must give access to election returns to parties challenging President Uhuru Kenyatta s victory in last month s presidential election, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday.  Access to the original vote tally forms and a copy of the voter register must immediately be granted to the petitioners, a former lawmaker and two human rights activists, the judges said. They denied a request for access to the electronic devices used in vote counting. The legal challenges come after the court nullified Kenyatta s August victory and ordered a new election, an unprecedented move in Africa. The current proceedings may be the last chance for legal scrutiny of the second election, held on Oct. 26. The protracted political crisis has stirred fears for the stability of the east African nation, a regional hub for trade, diplomacy and security. The court is on a tight schedule. It has until Nov. 20 to rule on the two petitions. If the election result is upheld, Kenyatta will be sworn in on Nov. 28. Chief Justice David Maraga told the petitioners they must file a report on their findings from the returns by Thursday afternoon.  After Wednesday s ruling, lawyers for the petitioners began presenting their cases, arguing the poll s outcome is void because the election board did not hold fresh nominations after the earlier poll was invalidated, among other reasons.   Our position is you cannot have a fresh presidential election without a fresh round of nominations,  said Benjamin Musyoki, a lawyer for former legislator Harun Mwau. The lawyer for the two activists, Julie Soweto, also argued that voter turnout - just 39 percent, because opposition leader Raila Odinga boycotted the election - required the court to consider whether the election conformed  to the spirit and intent of the constitution.  Violence before and during the election also marred the process, Soweto said. She also referred to remarks by the election board chair the week before polling - he said he could not guarantee the vote would be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against his colleagues [L8N1MT0XK]. The process in the Supreme Court, however, may not repair the rifts opened by this year s prolonged elections season. A poll released by research firm Ipsos found that 80 percent of Kenyans think the country is going in the wrong direction. Pessimism about the country s path was at a record high - higher than during drought and food shortages earlier this year or a prolonged teachers  strike in 2015.  Human rights groups say at least 66 people have died in election violence, mostly at the hands of police cracking down  on opposition supporters. Electioneering has also disrupted East Africa s richest economy. The government lowered its forecast for 2017 economic growth to 5.5 percent, partly because of the  political uncertainty.  The Supreme Court was created by a 2010 constitution that followed a violent political crisis three years earlier. Around 1,200 people were killed in ethnic clashes after a disputed election in 2007. However, analysts said the moves by Kenya s court may  embolden other judiciaries in Africa. This month, Liberia s Supreme Court halted a presidential run-off until the election board investigates claims of fraud in the first round of voting.    ',\n",
       " 'Shawn Helton 21st Century WireYesterday, a wave of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks hit some of the top online companies websites including Amazon, Netflix, Twitter and Reddit. One cannot rule out the very real possibility that this a staged-managed event, especially when you consider The New York Times was listed among those affected. If recent US media and political themes are anything to go by, you can expect a cascading chorus of blame directed at Russia.In this age of America s new and improved trial by media format, you can expect a litany of unfounded accusations, along with the usual anti-Russia hyperbole and waving fingers at Washington s new go-to scapegoat   Russian president Vladimir Putin.The likelihood of Russia or any other country being involved in this heavily coordinated DDoS incident falls flat, when you consider that the US media has been floating the  blame Russia  meme for months now, and even more conveniently during this 2016 US presidential election cycle, led by Vice President Joe Biden, and of course, the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, all blaming the Kremlin for both the DNC Leaks and the Wikileaks email dump.Indeed, as you look back at NY Times articles since the summer, the stage was being set to implant the idea of an alleged Russian cyber war being waged at the US, principally charging that they would  meddle  with the US presidential elections in 2016 by aiding Donald Trump. Here s the NY Times building the case for Washington, seemingly without the burden of proof: An unusual question is capturing the attention of cyberspecialists, Russia experts and Democratic Party leaders in Philadelphia: Is Vladimir V. Putin trying to meddle in the American presidential election?Until Friday, that charge, with its eerie suggestion of a Kremlin conspiracy to aid Donald J. Trump, has been only whispered. In August, the western media s claims against Russia hit overdrive, when the  New York Times s Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyberattack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful. Flash forward to September here and here, as well as early October in the lead up to President Obama s decree, the Clinton friendly outlet the NY Times had all but solidified the Russian cyber/hack claims   once again, without any definitive proof.If Russia is going to be the scapegoat for this recent DDoS attack, then consider the following   HACK ATTACK?    Who was behind the Black Friday internet outage in America? (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Immediately when the cyber attack story broke, the establishment quickly wheeled out their  experts , as CNN s chief gatekeeper Wolf Blitzer cued-up scripted questions to Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) advocate, Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn (R, TN), Vice Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Not only is Blackburn is a staunch supporter of more draconian copyright laws (she once claimed that  Fair Use  was the same as  theft), she is also a fellow traveller on Washington s Anti-Russia bandwagon.In true propagandist fashion, Blitzer wasted no time asking her,  Do you think this be the work of a foreign government?  Blackburn immediately blamed the hack on the fact that the SOPA bill didn t pass, claiming that SOPA  would have blocked some of the bad actors ,  and went on to blame  cyber bots  (activists) for defeating the bill. From the obvious way that Washington oracle CNN had this story already cued up, it strongly indicates that the Washington was stage-managing this latest  cyber crisis.  WAITING IN THE WINGS: Tennessee  Republican Congressman Marsha Blackburn.As scapegoats go, blaming Russia is the gift that keeps on giving (and way past this Christmas). Last week, President Obama threw Hillary Clinton a campaign assist by formally accusing Russia of interfering with US elections process through Wikileaks. Suddenly, Washington had declared a Cyber War against Russia. The NY Times wrote: Since the Obama administration formally accused Russia about a week ago of trying to interfere in the election, there has been intense speculation about whether President Obama has ordered the National Security Agency to conduct a retaliatory cyberstrike.Despite all the White House and corporate media hype, no evidence at all has been presented by Washington that proves the Kremlin are hacking and  interfering with the US election process. Vice President Joe Biden, also spoke on matters of security and sent a telegraphed  message to Putin  through NBC s Meet the Press, just one day after Obama s own  Russian  declaration. Based on these latest developments, it s easy to see how this could have been an effort prime another back story to blame Russia for these DDoS attacks.The real question surrounding this apparent DDoS attack, should be directed at America s National Security Agency (NSA) and its bevy of contractors, many of whom are tasked with global and (illegal) domestic surveillance, through passive data collection and clandestine processing of communications. Surely they would know where this attack was originated (including in-house).Could this latest incident possibly be to further create a  climate of fear  during this, the most contentious presidential election in 40 years?Could this also be a government-coordinated cyber drill?Was this a government orchestrated false flag hack?It s no secret that the US government would like to pass a newer more potent version of 2011-2012 s  Stop Online Piracy Act otherwise known as SOPA. In fact, NextGov, reported the following in 2014: Nearly three years after a massive online protest derailed the Stop Online Piracy Act, many lawmakers are still nervous about even uttering the name  SOPA  in public.The bill, which once had broad bipartisan support and was a top priority for the entertainment industry, has become a dirty word. The backlash was a traumatic lesson for members of Congress about the danger of siding against tech companies and Internet activists, who warned the bill could break the Internet.Now, for the first time since SOPA crashed and burned in early 2012, the House Judiciary Committee is preparing to work on a major update of copyright law. As lawmakers cautiously return to the issue of copyright protection, the SOPA protest looms large in their minds. Tech outlet Wired described the incident in the following manner. It s crucial to note that the internet performance management company Dyn was front and center   weighing in on the situation prior to any US intelligence agency making an official statement. Dyn states: This morning s attack started around 7 am ET and was aimed at Dyn, an Internet infrastructure company headquartered in New Hampshire. That first bout was resolved after about two hours; a second attack began just before noon. Dyn reported a third wave of attacks a little after 4 pm ET. In all cases, traffic to Dyn s Internet directory servers throughout the US primarily on the East Coast but later on the opposite end of the country as well was stopped by a flood of malicious requests from tens of millions of IP addresses disrupting the system. Late in the day, Dyn described the events as a  very sophisticated and complex attack.  Still ongoing, the situation is a definite reminder of the fragility of the web, and the power of the forces that aim to disrupt it. Regardless of who was actually behind the widespread internet attack, judging by the rhetoric and the mainstream media talking points  this has to be about the government wanting to usher in new  ISP governance  (making ISP s bent to government wishes to  kick out the bad actors  off their networks) and rights-violating security protocols. Is it also possible that social media giant Twitter and mega-consumer brands like Amazon have been used as willing guinea pigs, just like Yahoo was recently when their mailable CEO Marissa Mayer handed over the backdoor keys to Yahoo customer email account to the NSA and FBI.Are the US government determined to gain complete access and have total control over the internet?The idea isn t that far-fetched Yahoo s Marissa Mayer: sold out to the NSA.After Yahoo recently admitted to creating a virtual backdoor for US intelligence agencies to spy on everyday citizen s email accounts, the government exposed its own Orwellian ambitions: Yahoo last year secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers  incoming emails for specific information provided by US intelligence officials, according to people familiar with the matter.The company complied with a classified US government directive, scanning hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts at the behest of the National Security Agency or FBI, two former employees and a third person apprised of the events said. This is a very important issue moving forward, as a dip in consumer confidence could be a crushing blow to any company s overall brand after complying with new  1984  security measures   all at the behest of the FBI, NSA, CIA and their trusted partners.Back in March, individual privacy versus global security was at the heart of the case between Apple and the FBI. Here s a telling passage from that report as it relates to this most recent internet attack: The ongoing encryption saga between Apple and the FBI, we stated that there are no guarantees in the security world, especially if a digital master-key were to be created, as this would potentially make it easier for invaders (either the government, or various hackers) mining for data moving forward into the future.In a recent Guardian article, some of those involved in the technology and security sector offered their thoughts regarding the government s continued encroachment on individual privacy: Dan Kaminsky, the security expert who made his name with the discovery that one of the most basic parts of the internet, the domain name system, was vulnerable to fraud   disagrees:  Feds want final authority on engineering decisions, and their interests don t even align with fighting the vast bulk of real-world crime. Kaminsky further explained why Apple s security measures already help law enforcement, If my iPhone is stolen, my emails stay unread, my photos stay unviewed, and I don t need to notify anyone that the secrets they entrusted me with are going to show up on the internet tomorrow. Continuing, The Guardian interviewed former FBI agent Michael German, currently at judicial think-tank the Brennan Center. The following is a portion of that interview: After 9/11, you had this concept of total information awareness. The intelligence community was very enamoured of the idea that all information was available. Much like the NSA, they wanted to see it all, collect it all, and analyse it all. Additionally, there are many who believe weaker encryption may pose an even bigger security risk globally.In many ways, it appears as though federal agencies are seemingly searching for the right crisis to push public opinion in favor of the state when it comes to security.This is at the core of the perpetual privacy and security battle post 9/11 How could it be that such propaganda could happen in America? Well, it s worth another look at a Senate hearing discussing the CIA s tremendous influence on the United States media under the moniker Operation Mockingbird ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump urged Senate Republicans on Monday to move ahead this week on a bid to repeal his predecessorâ\\x80\\x99s signature healthcare law, saying any senator who votes against it is telling America â\\x80\\x9cyou are fine with the Obamacare nightmare.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTo every member of the Senate I say this: the American people have waited long enough. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s been enough talk, and no action. Now is the time for action,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said at the White House. He added that people were demanding change, saying, â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll see that at the voter booth, believe me.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an order to undo Obama-era climate change regulations, keeping a campaign promise to support the coal industry and calling into question U.S. support for an international deal to fight global warming. Flanked by coal miners and coal company executives, Trump proclaimed his â\\x80\\x9cEnergy Independenceâ\\x80\\x9d executive order at the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The move drew swift backlash from a coalition of 23 states and local governments, as well as environmental groups, which called the decree a threat to public health and vowed to fight it in court. The orderâ\\x80\\x99s main target is former President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s Clean Power Plan, which required states to slash carbon emissions from power plants - a key factor in the United Statesâ\\x80\\x99 ability to meet its commitments under a climate change accord reached by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015.  Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s decree also reverses a ban on coal leasing on federal lands, undoes rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production and reduces the weight of climate change and carbon emissions in policy and infrastructure permitting decisions. Carbon dioxide and methane are two of the main greenhouse gases blamed by scientists for heating the earth. â\\x80\\x9cI am taking historic steps to lift restrictions on American energy, to reverse government intrusion and to cancel job-killing regulations,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said at the EPA.  The room was filled with miners, coal company executives and staff from industry groups, who applauded loudly as Trump spoke. Shares in U.S. coal companies edged higher in response.   The wide-ranging order is the boldest yet in Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s broader push to cut environmental regulation to revive the drilling and mining industries, a promise he made repeatedly during the 2016 presidential campaign.  Energy analysts and executives have questioned whether the moves will have a big effect on their industries, and environmentalists have called them reckless. â\\x80\\x9cI cannot tell you how many jobs the executive order is going to create, but I can tell you that it provides confidence in this administrationâ\\x80\\x99s commitment to the coal industry,â\\x80\\x9d Kentucky Coal Association president Tyler White told Reuters. Environmental groups heaped scorn on Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s order, arguing it was dangerous and went against the broader global trend toward cleaner energy technologies. A coalition of mostly Democrat-led states and local governments issued a statement saying they would oppose the order in court. â\\x80\\x9cWe wonâ\\x80\\x99t hesitate to protect those we serve â\\x80\\x94 including by aggressively opposing in court President Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s actions that ignore both the law and the critical importance of confronting the very real threat of climate change,â\\x80\\x9d the coalition, led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said in a statement.  The coalition includes states such as California, Massachusetts and Virginia, as well as cities including Chicago, Philadelphia and Boulder, Colorado. U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day, almost enough to meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined. An overwhelming majority of scientists believe that human use of oil and coal for energy is a main driver of climate change, causing a damaging rise in sea levels, droughts and more frequent violent storms.  But Trump and several members of his administration have doubts about climate change, and Trump promised during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, arguing it would hurt U.S. business.  Since being elected, Trump has been mum on the Paris deal and the executive order does not address it. Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change who helped broker the Paris accord, lamented Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s order. â\\x80\\x9cTrying to make fossil fuels remain competitive in the face of a booming clean renewable power sector, with the clean air and plentiful jobs it continues to generate, is going against the flow of economics,â\\x80\\x9d she said. The order directs the EPA to start a formal process to undo the Clean Power Plan, which was introduced by Obama in 2014 but was never implemented in part because of legal challenges brought by Republican-controlled states.  The Clean Power Plan required states to collectively cut carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Some 85 percent of U.S. states are on track to meet the targets despite the fact the rule has not been implemented, according to Bill Becker, director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, a group of state and local air pollution control agencies. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s order also lifts the Interior Departmentâ\\x80\\x99s Bureau of Land Management temporary ban on coal leasing on federal property put in place by Obama in 2016 as part of a review to study the programâ\\x80\\x99s impact on climate change and ensure royalty revenues were fair to taxpayers. It also asks federal agencies to discount the cost of carbon in policy decisions and the weight of climate change considerations in infrastructure permitting, and it reverses rules limiting methane leakage from oil and gas facilities.

       " 'HOLLAND, Ohio (Reuters) - â\\x80\\x9cJoe the Plumber,â\\x80\\x9d the Ohio workingman who came to symbolize U.S. taxpayer frustration in the 2008 presidential election, is still angry. And like many angry voters, he likes insurgent Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump â\\x80\\x94 in part because the New York billionaire dated attractive women. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s a winner. Heâ\\x80\\x99s made billions. Heâ\\x80\\x99s dated beautiful women. His wife is a model. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not to sniff at. And a lot of people believe he can bring that kind of success to the White House,â\\x80\\x9d said Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher, 42, who shot to prominence during the 2008 campaign after then-Republican nominee John McCain seized on a confrontation Wurzelbacher had with then-Democratic candidate Barack Obama. Sitting in his Ohio house, a Ruger handgun on a table next to him, Wurzelbacher told Reuters he has yet to decide who to support but says he understands why so many people are drawn to the caustic Trump, a real-estate developer and former reality TV show host, and is unhappy with the Republican Party establishment lining up against him. He said Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s position as an insurgent candidate who is willing to defy party leaders was a more important reason to vote for him than his wealth and the model-looks of his wife Melania. But he said he believed other voters were drawn to his larger-than-life image and glamorous lifestyle.  He also likes Ted Cruz, the conservative U.S. senator from Texas. He is scathing about Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida and the favorite of the Republican establishment to challenge Trump. And he dislikes John Kasich, the Ohio governor who narrowly trails Trump in his home state with less than two weeks until Ohioâ\\x80\\x99s primary on March 15. Trump, 69, is the front-runner in the race for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election, but party leaders worry policies that include building a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States will turn off voters and upset U.S. allies.    As a conservative, Wurzelbacher says he is willing to overlook Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s previous heresies on issues such as gun control, abortion, gay marriage and even his past donations to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner. The Obama administration, he says, is a miserable failure. In the 2008 campaign, Wurzelbacher made headlines when he asked Obama about his small business tax policy. During a videotaped exchange, Obama answered in part by saying, â\\x80\\x9cwhen you spread the wealth around, itâ\\x80\\x99s good for everybody.â\\x80\\x9d   Wurzelbacher had told Obama he was interested in buying a plumbing business. Two days later McCain, Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s opponent, cited â\\x80\\x9cJoe the Plumberâ\\x80\\x9d as the quintessential American everyman who had exposed Obama as having what McCain called a socialist, wealth-distributing economic world view. It mattered little that â\\x80\\x9cJoeâ\\x80\\x9d wasnâ\\x80\\x99t his first name. He never ultimately got a plumbing license in Ohio. But he says he was honorably discharged from the U.S. Air Force as a journeyman plumber. Soon after, Wurzelbacher appeared at rallies with McCain and his running mate, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin. He seemed enraged at Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s economic policies.  Today, he is highly critical of Senator McCain, deriding his opposition to Trump as corrupt. â\\x80\\x9cThey are not opposing Trump for the American people. They are doing it for their party, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t like that. Itâ\\x80\\x99s control, power, greed. Trump scares them.â\\x80\\x9d Wurzelbacher, who had assailed unions along with Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s decision to use taxpayer money to rescue the car manufacturers Chrysler and General Motors from bankruptcy in 2009, drew much criticism when it emerged that he took a job at a Chrysler plant in Toledo, Ohio, in 2014 - and joined a local union to get it. â\\x80\\x9cThat was an experiment,â\\x80\\x9d Wurzelbacher said. He said he never intended to work at Chrysler full-time. He wanted to see inside a union factory so he could write about it, he said. He worked on the paint line for three months, and then left. He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012, winning the Republican primary for Ohioâ\\x80\\x99s 9th congressional district but lost to Democratic Marcy Kaptur by a landslide. Wurzelbacher says his life has settled down since the madness of 2008. He got married five years ago. He has a three-year-old daughter and one-year-old son, and a 20-year-old son living in Kentucky. He now spends his time running two websites, JoeforAmerica.com, and one his wife inspired, livingloving.com. But he is disgusted by much of the debate in America. â\\x80\\x9cPolitical correctness is a huge issue. People are afraid to speak their minds. They are afraid of being labeled a racist or a homophobe.â\\x80\\x9d On guns, Wurzelbacher says the more people who have guns, the safer they will be.

       " 'Rubio, Cruz, Christie Improve Their Standing In Third GOP Debate\\n\\nThe Republican presidential race entered a new phase Wednesday night as the outsider candidates, who dominated the first two debates, were upstaged by several of their office-holding rivals â\\x80\\x94 and by a budding controversy over the conduct of the third debate itself.\\n\\nBen Carson, Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina were all on hand and all had their moments. But the featured performer of the night was Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida who, at 44, is the youngest contestant in the field. Also acquitting themselves well were his Senate colleague, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Chris Christie, the oft-embattled governor of New Jersey.\\n\\nChristie\\'s much-maligned campaign had barely qualified for inclusion in this debate, but he seemed revivified by the questions and the interchange â\\x80\\x94 especially the contretemps with the CNBC moderators.\\n\\n\"Even in New Jersey what you\\'re doing would be called rude,\" said Christie, referring to CNBC moderator John Harwood.\\n\\nRubio became the debate\\'s focus largely because of tough questions from the CNBC moderators that he deftly turned into recitations of his talking points. When other rivals tried to probe the same vulnerabilities, Rubio was quickly able to flip the polarity and deliver a put down in response.\\n\\nQuestioned about his missed votes in the Senate (the most of any senator this year) and his stated lack of interest in that position, Rubio noted how many votes had been missed by senators in both parties pursuing the presidency in the past.\\n\\nWhen Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor sometimes described as Rubio\\'s mentor, renewed the criticism (\"What is it in the Senate, a French work week, where you only have to show up for three days?\") Rubio wondered why Bush had never spoken out about such things before.\\n\\n\"The only reason why you\\'re doing it now,\" Rubio charged, \"is because we\\'re running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.\"\\n\\nBush was not able to establish much momentum after that, finishing near the bottom of the list in speaking time. It was his third flat performance in the debate series to date, and the most damaging in its timing. His campaign had highlighted the evening, calling it Bush\\'s chance to rebut suggestions he lacks real enthusiasm for this campaign. In recent weeks, he has seemed diffident and off-message at times in public appearances. He has laid off staff, as his standing in the polls has continued to decline.\\n\\nRubio, by stark contrast, was both sharp with a cutting remark and adept at the charming aside. Talking about a program for older people, he beamed boyishly as he said, \"I\\'d never vote for anything that would hurt my mom.\"\\n\\nRubio has been locked in the single digits in national polls and surveys in the early voting states as well. But many who watched the third debate expected that to change. And if the current front-runners should fade, leaving their voters up for grabs, the contest could become between Rubio and Cruz.\\n\\nThe night\\'s peak energy point came when Cruz fielded a typically truculent question from one of the CNBC moderators and hit it out of the park.\\n\\n\"The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don\\'t trust the media,\" Cruz said.\\n\\nThe debate audience, clearly a sympathetic crowd, roared its approval, nearly drowning out Cruz as he continued.\\n\\n\"This is not a cage match,\" Cruz added. \"And, you look at the questions â\\x80\\x94 \\'Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?\\' \\'Ben Carson, can you do math?\\' \\'John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?\\' \\'Marco Rubio, why don\\'t you resign?\\' \\'Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?\\'\"\\n\\nCruz contrasted these questions with those at the Democratic debate, even though that event was put on by CNN. He said all the Democrats were asked was, \"Which of you is more handsome and why?\"\\n\\nSeveral of the other Republican candidates tried to get in on the crowd\\'s appetite for media criticism before the evening was over. Their staffs were also complaining about the in-your-face tone of the CNBC crew. After the debate, Carson\\'s campaign manager talked about renegotiating the terms of the remaining debates.\\n\\nReince Priebus, the GOP national chairman who took control of the debates this year and made deals with the various news outlets, also expressed dismay after the debate and said changes would be made to future formats.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the man who has been proud of leading in polls among Republicans since July, Donald Trump, held his own Wednesday night despite a disappointing slide to No. 2 in some of the most recent tests both nationally and in Iowa. Trump delivered his stock lines about taxes, immigration and badly negotiated deals on trade and foreign relations. But the Trump presence was a measure less effervescent than on the stump or in earlier debates.\\n\\nThe new leader in some polls, Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, reprised his role as the quiet man on stage. He had less speaking time than almost any other candidate, and when he had the spotlight, he did little to hold it. Asked for a weakness, he cited his failure to think of himself as presidential material (\"until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it\"). He also seemed unsure of his footing at times when describing his tax rate plan and other economic matters.\\n\\nBut Carson, too, took the opportunity to push back on the CNBC journalists. When Carl Quintanilla asked about Carson\\'s association with a controversial maker of nutritional supplements, Carson flatly denied any involvement and called the assertion \"pure propaganda.\"\\n\\nIn fact, Carson starred in a promotional video for the company and may face more questions about his statement in the days ahead. But when Quintanilla tried to follow up, the crowd booed and Carson took the out: \"See,\" he said, \"they know.\"\\n\\nCarly Fiorina, regarded by many as the standout performer in the Sept. 16 debate, managed to get more speaking time this time than any of her rivals â\\x80\\x94 in part, by resisting the moderators. But while she came across as self-assured and offered one of her best defenses of leadership at Hewlett-Packard a decade ago, Fiorina did not have a memorable exchange with Trump or any of the candidates.\\n\\nThe other four candidates who took part may have experienced more frustration than fulfillment. Rand Paul, a senator from Kentucky, was one of the three candidates with fewest minutes of airtime. His efforts to climb into the tax debate were largely unsuccessful. Mike Huckabee had his usual moments of folksy humor but few scoring opportunities.\\n\\nThe man who had the highest hopes for this round may have been John Kasich, the governor of Ohio who has tried to go after the non-politician front-runners, attacking the unrealistic promises of lower taxes and an end to illegal immigration. Kasich kicked off the evening with thinly veiled criticisms of Carson and Trump as potential occupants of the Oval Office.\\n\\n\"My great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job,\" he charged, adding, \"We need somebody who can lead.\"\\n\\nTrump promptly fired back with a withering rebuttal about Kasich\\'s Ohio success being a windfall from oil produced by fracking, and about Kasich\\'s partnership at Lehman Brothers shortly before that Wall Street firm collapsed and set off the worst of the 2008 financial panic.\\n\\nKasich had a comeback, but his offensive came up short.',\n",

For example, Liptior (atorvastatin), which is used to regulate cholesterol, generates a sales profit of $131 billion with the prescription only costing patients around $2 per day. \\nBut with rare diseases, prices must be kept high in order to keep Big Pharma in business. This means that while those with uncommon illnesses may benefit healthwise from the new measures, their pocketbooks are in for a hit. \\nFor example, the cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco by Vertex costs individual patients $311,000. \\nGileadâ\\x80\\x99s Sovaldi, used to treat Hepatitis C, cashes in at $84,000 for a paltry 12-week course of medication. \\nAnd Soliris, used to treat rare blood conditions, costs the patient a whopping $400,000 per year. \\nThe list of the 10 most expensive drugs that are currently manufactured are all created to treat â\\x80\\x9corphanâ\\x80\\x9d or uncommon illnesses. \\nThanks to these laws that allow Big Pharma to charge these insane amounts of money, they can use those who suffer from rare diseases as their cash cows. \\nDrugs for rare diseases will account for 19% of pharmaceutical branded drug profits by the year 2020.

A new study finds the scariest part of the holiday may not be the costumes, but makeup for kids. Out of 48 makeup palettes, almost half contained toxic heavy metals. \\nNearly 20 percent of makeup palettes contain lead and cadmium, according to the newly published study by the Breast Cancer Fund. The study found that some products contained as many as four metals, including arsenic and chromium. \\nNine of the palettes were found to contain lead, a chemical that is unsafe at any level, for children particularly. Parents may have purchased and applied these products to their children unwittingly, as the makeup doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have to list ingredients on their labels. \\nThe BCF may have been among the first to test the palettes, as the FDA does not regulate this particular product. \\nâ\\x80\\x9c The FDA that regulates makeup does not have the power to require pre-market testing ,â\\x80\\x9d Jen Coleman with the Oregon Environmental Council told KGW. \\nThe cosmetic safety law enacted 75 years ago does not require testing even for products marketed to children. While the FDA cannot do anything about the problem, they have issued guidelines to avoiding â\\x80\\x9c a rash, swollen eyelids, or other reaction â\\x80\\x9d this Halloween. \\nThe guidelines make no mention of potential heavy metal poisoning, but they do offer advice like â\\x80\\x9c Follow all directions carefully ,â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9c Donâ\\x80\\x99t decorate your face with things that arenâ\\x80\\x99t intended for your skin. â\\x80\\x9d \\nWhatâ\\x80\\x99s a parent to do in the meantime?

       " 'LONDON  â\\x80\\x94   The media and entertainment mogul Rupert Murdoch was on the verge of taking full control of the British satellite television giant Sky five years ago when his takeover bid was derailed by a   scandal in his companyâ\\x80\\x99s publishing arm. On Friday, Sky said that Mr. Murdochâ\\x80\\x99s 21st Century Fox had reached a preliminary deal to acquire the 61 percent stake in Sky it did not already own. The new takeover offer would value Sky at about $23 billion. The two companies are still in talks over the final terms of a deal, Sky said. The takeover approach came more than five years after 21st Century Foxâ\\x80\\x99s predecessor company, News Corporation, withdrew a $12 billion offer for the rest of Sky  â\\x80\\x94   then known as BSkyB  â\\x80\\x94   as a firestorm erupted over   by the media in Britain. In 2011, it emerged that reporters at News of the World, a Sunday tabloid newspaper then owned by a subsidiary of News Corporation, had hacked the mobile phone of a young murder victim in Britain and listened to her voice mail messages, inciting outrage in Britain. The scandal led to the newspaper being closed and soon engulfed News Corporationâ\\x80\\x99s publishing business in Britain. News Corporation split into two companies in 2013. Its entertainment assets were housed in the newly christened 21st Century Fox, while the new News Corporation consisted of its publishing business, including The Wall Street Journal and The Times of London. The scandal also forced James Murdoch, the son of Rupert Murdoch and chief executive of 21st Century Fox, to step down as chairman of Sky. The younger Mr. Murdoch served as chairman of Sky from 2007 to 2012 and retained a seat on its board after resigning as chairman. At the time of the phone hacking scandal, James Murdoch oversaw News Corporationâ\\x80\\x99s businesses in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. He was never found to have any direct knowledge of the hacking, but a Parliament committee investigating the scandal accused him of â\\x80\\x9cwillful ignorance. â\\x80\\x9d James Murdoch acknowledged at the time that he had failed to read emails that referred to settlement payments made to hacking victims. Despite the scandal, the younger Mr. Murdoch has remained well respected in European media circles and returned to serve as Skyâ\\x80\\x99s chairman this year, spurring speculation that another takeover bid by 21st Century Fox was in the works. On Friday, Sky said that 21st Century Fox had offered to pay 10. 75 pounds a share in cash ($13. 58) less the value of any dividends subsequently paid by Sky. The new offer represents a 40 percent premium to the Skyâ\\x80\\x99s closing price on Tuesday, the last day before the initial Fox approach. Shares of Sky closed up nearly 27 percent in trading in London on Friday after the announcement but ended the day below the offer price. In the United States, shares of 21st Century Fox closed down 2 percent. â\\x80\\x9cThere can be no certainty that an offer will be made by 21st Century Fox, nor as to the terms of any such offer,â\\x80\\x9d Sky said in a news release. Sky said that its independent directors had indicated to 21st Century Fox that they were willing to recommend the proposal to shareholders, subject to reaching an agreement on the other outstanding terms. The independent directors were advised by Barclays, Morgan Stanley and PJT Partners, Sky said. The company also said that it had formed an independent committee of its directors that it considers free of any conflicts of interest to consider the terms of the Fox proposal. A potential bid for the rest of Sky by 21st Century Fox was widely anticipated by analysts, particularly after ATT agreed to acquire Time Warner for $84. 5 billion in October. â\\x80\\x9cWe think the likelihood of a Fox bid for Sky now rises, which would create a stronger vertically integrated business in Europe,â\\x80\\x9d Tim Nollen, senior media analyst at Macquarie Bank, wrote in a report in October after the Time Warner deal. The   Warner deal was the latest in a series of transactions by media companies in recent years to gain scale, control more content and distribute that content directly to customers. On Friday, 21st Century Fox said that its 39 percent stake in Sky was â\\x80\\x9cnot a natural end position. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cA proposed transaction between 21st Century Fox and Sky would bring together 21st Century Foxâ\\x80\\x99s global content business with Skyâ\\x80\\x99s      capabilities, which have made it the number one premium   provider in all its markets,â\\x80\\x9d 21st Century Fox said in a news release. â\\x80\\x9cIt would also enhance Skyâ\\x80\\x99s leading position in entertainment and sport, and reinforce the U. K.â\\x80\\x99s standing as a top global hub for content generation and technological innovation,â\\x80\\x9d the company added. Gaining full control of Sky would be consistent with efforts by James Murdoch since he took over as chief executive to simplify  â\\x80\\x94   and gain greater control over  â\\x80\\x94   21st Century Foxâ\\x80\\x99s ventures. Last year, 21st Century Fox announced a deal valued at $725 million to create a   joint venture with the National Geographic Society that encompassed the National Geographic Channels cable television group along with National Geographicâ\\x80\\x99s other properties.   Century Fox owns a 73 percent stake in the venture, National Geographic Partners. The deal came after an   partnership between Fox and the nonprofit group for National Geographic Channels. The company has also looked for more ways to take its content directly to consumers, including signing a deal in November to provide live streaming of its television channels through a new service being introduced next year by Hulu, which 21st Century Fox partly owns. Sky has reshaped itself into a   satellite provider in recent years, buying Sky Italia and a controlling stake in Sky Deutschland for more than $9 billion from 21st Century Fox in 2014. Sky, which offers television, broadband and telephone phone services, has nearly 22 million customers in Austria, Britain, Germany, Ireland and Italy. It reported revenue of nearly Â£12 billion ($15. 1 billion) in its 2016 fiscal year, which ended June 30. Sky exclusively licenses a variety of television shows from AMC Networks, HBO and Showtime in Europe, including â\\x80\\x9cGame of Thrones,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe Walking Deadâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cThe Affair. â\\x80\\x9d It also broadcasts the top soccer leagues in Britain, Germany and Italy. Fox is being advised in the discussions by Centerview Partners and Deutsche Bank.',\n",

Melissa Cook was hired to be a surrogate mother for an unidentified Georgia man earlier this year.She was to be paid $33,000 for her efforts. But what both parties didn t expect was triplets.Cook and the man used in-vitro fertilization, combining his sperm with the egg of an unnamed 20-year-old woman. Cook was implanted with three embryos, each of them defying the odds. The result was triplets.Now, the Georgia man is demanding Cook to abort one of the babies or face financial ruin.Cook, who is a California native, spoke to the The New York Post: They are human beings. I bonded with these kids. This is just not right Robert Warmsley, the unnamed man s lawyer, warned in a letter that his client: understands, albeit does not agree, with your decision not to reduce. As you know, his remedies where you refuse to abide by the terms of the agreement, are immense [and] include, but are not limited to, loss of all benefits under the agreement, damages in relation to future care of the children [and] medical costs associated with any extraordinary care the children may need. In other words, she ll be stripped of her pay, and could face a lawsuit, if she doesn t comply with his wishes to abort one of the babies.Melissa Cook responded, penning a heartfelt letter in which she questioned the decision: The doctor put in three healthy embryos,  she wrote. The chances were high they were all going to take. If you knew you only wanted two babies, then why put in three embryos?  Cook is currently 17 weeks pregnant.California law dictates that, aside from life-threatening exceptions, fetuses cannot be aborted once they become  viable,  which is typically around 20 weeks.

       " 'STOCKHOLM (AFP)  â\\x80\\x94   WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange filed a new motion in Sweden Wednesday calling for a European arrest warrant over rape allegations to be dropped, after the United States said it was seeking to arrest him, his lawyer said. [The    Australian denies the accusations in Sweden that date back to 2010, which he fears will see him extradited to the United States.  He has been holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 and risks being arrested by British police as soon as he steps out of the building. His Swedish lawyer Per Samuelsson said the new motion was filed because US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in April that arresting Assange would be â\\x80\\x9ca priorityâ\\x80\\x9d. â\\x80\\x9cThis implies that we can now demonstrate that the US has a will to take action  â\\x80¦     this is why we ask for the arrest warrant to be cancelled so that Julian Assange can fly to Ecuador and enjoy his political asylum,â\\x80\\x9d Samuelsson told AFP.

Assange fears imprisonment in the United States over the leaking by WikiLeaks of hundreds of thousands of secret US military and diplomatic documents that first gained attention in 2010. He has made numerous appeals to Swedish courts, including the Supreme Court, but has lost eight bids to cancel the arrest warrant. Swedish judges have refused to take into account the opinion of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which in February 2016 said Assange â\\x80\\x9cwas arbitrarily detainedâ\\x80\\x9d by Sweden and Britain and called for the warrant to be annulled.',\n",
       " 'An examination of Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes on Saturday was totally devastating and damning.This week, after FBI Director James Comey refuted Donald Trump s claim that he was wiretapped by President Obama, Nunes held a hasty press conference in a desperate effort to portray Trump as a victim whose wiretapping accusation was right all along.Nunes is in charge of the committee that is supposed to be investigating Trump s Russia scandal, but he tied the wiretapping claim into it in order to distract from the main investigation.But reporters have been digging into Nunes this week and have found some bombshells that should bring Trump and the GOP down, and Joy Reid and her panel discussed the top four.First, Nunes told Mother Jones reporter David Corn that he has never heard of Carter Page or Roger Stone, both of whom are Trump stooges with ties to Russia. Again, Nunes is the chair of the House Intelligence Committee charged with investigating Trump s ties to Russia. He should damn well know who Stone and Page are.Even Corn was  stunned  by Nunes answer and had only three possible explanations. Either he s a dimwit who hasn t read a single story about the matter he s supposed to be vetting or he has some brain disease and can t remember or he was lying to me,  Corn said.  Those are the only options I can think of. It was a bizarre moment and you re right, we could spend the next hour talking about all the weird things and bizarre things he did this week from cancelling hearings to coming forward with incomplete information to rushing to Trump. Corn then warned that Nunes demonstrated that the House Intelligence Committee is broken and is incapable of overseeing what the Executive Branch is doing. It is a breakdown, and I say this to be serious. It s the breakdown of the Congressional intelligence oversight process and the only reason we let the Executive Branch do secret work in terms of espionage, counterintelligence, counter-terrorism is because they ve overseen by the Legislative Branch. And Devin Nunes just showed this week that there is a complete breakdown in that process. Reid then turned to national security expert Malcolm Nance and asked him about why Nunes abruptly left his car after taking a phone call and disappeared for a bit. Nance opined that Nunes got called to the White House and was told to present the  incidental surveillance  as proof to vindicate Trump. Because soon after his disappearing act, Nunes called his press conference. Nance went on to call Nunes  clueless about what surveillance is. But that s not all. Reid asked Sarah Kendzior, who is an expert on authoritarian states, about Nunes taking information about the investigation to Trump.Kendzior explained that Nunes is  supposed to be watchdog but he s acting like a lapdog  and that instead of investigating, he s  acting like an informant.  She cited Nunes  behavior as just another example of Trump s corrupt regime.Scott Dworkin chimed in when Reid asked about Nunes owning part of a winery that has a direct connection to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin through a Russian investor. Dworkin pointed out that it should not be so easy to be connected to Putin and stated that Nunes should not be a congressman and he definitely shouldn t be the chairman of the intelligence committee since his wallet is so close to Putin.Here s the video via VidMe:Reid and the panel also wondered how Nunes ended up becoming the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee considering he has no intelligence experience and doesn t know much about it.But the bottom line is that Nunes just destroyed his credibility and the credibility of the committee he chairs. This investigation needs to be turned over to a special prosecutor and an independent commission because it s clear that Nunes is more interested in helping Trump cover up his Russia scandal than he is in investigating it and finding the truth.Featured image via screenshot',\n",

But they managed to avoid capture for three weeks in the rugged northernmost reaches of New York State. Navigating by the stars and using evasion tactics gleaned from Vietnam War movies, they pillaged peanut butter and pasta  â\\x80\\x94   as well as moonshine and marijuana  â\\x80\\x94   from remote hunting cabins. They stole sleep by the hour and tracked their pursuersâ\\x80\\x99 movements via news reports on a purloined transistor radio. In the end, feet worn bloody by flight, they argued and went their separate ways before their bids for freedom ended  â\\x80\\x94   one in capture, one in death. The escape of David Sweat and Richard W. Matt in June 2015 from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, N. Y. captivated the nation. And much of the tale has since been told: how they patiently planned their escape how they manipulated the affections of a female prison employee how they broke out of the prison, one of the stateâ\\x80\\x99s toughest. But little has been disclosed about what it was actually like for the two hunted men during their   slog in the deep woods between the prison and the Canadian border. The survivor, Mr. Sweat, has told their story in novelistic detail  â\\x80\\x94   it reads like a new twist on a grand wilderness adventure  â\\x80\\x94   to investigators from the New York State Police, the state inspector generalâ\\x80\\x99s office and the state prison agency in a series of interviews that began from his hospital bed the day he was captured. It is contained in more than 500 pages of transcripts. It is the drama as seen from the vantage point of the hunted, the police and dogs always just one step behind, hopscotching from rural roads to rutted mountainsides, dragging themselves through swamps and up and down steep inclines. The men cobbled together their supplies from what was available inside the   prison  â\\x80\\x94   â\\x80\\x9cYou plan for the worst, hope for the best,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sweat said  â\\x80\\x94   amassing a supply of black pepper he later used to throw dogs off his scent, along with a shaver so they would not look like bearded fugitives. Much of the time the two men spent cold, wet, shivering nights sleeping on the ground or in elevated hunting blinds, platforms hidden high in the trees from which hunters stalk and shoot their prey, a perch from which Mr. Sweat said in one instance he could identify the search area by watching helicopters and planes above. But they also spent some time in   cabins used by hunters, at least some of which belong to state corrections officers who work in the prisons like Clinton, Mr. Sweat said. It was in one cabin that they found the moonshine and marijuana, which, along with a propane heater and an ample supply of food, would allow them to stay for two nights. In another officerâ\\x80\\x99s camp, they found a shotgun, which they took, and uniform jackets belonging to the corrections officers, which they apparently did not. â\\x80\\x9cI found their weed and everything,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sweat, 36, told his interrogators, referring to the first cabin. â\\x80\\x9cI was laughing my ass  â\\x80\\x94   because I like to smoke weed every once in a while. It mellows me out, keeps me calm. â\\x80\\x9d A senior investigator with the State Police asked if they had smoked any that night. â\\x80\\x9cYes, we got high as hell for like two nights,â\\x80\\x9d he said, adding that they also drank the moonshine. â\\x80\\x9cSo you know weâ\\x80\\x99d drink, get high and hang out because there ainâ\\x80\\x99t nobody coming up here during the week. â\\x80\\x9d The two convicted killers practically played house. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99d turn the heaters on and weâ\\x80\\x99d cook,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sweat recalled. â\\x80\\x9cWe made pasta and everything else because they had pasta there, because we didnâ\\x80\\x99t care  â\\x80\\x94   it was the C. O. s,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d he said, using the shorthand for corrections officers, noting they were unlikely to report the   because of the marijuana. The transcripts of the interviews were obtained under the stateâ\\x80\\x99s Freedom of Information Law. They reveal Mr. Sweat as an enthusiastic raconteur, eager to regale his questioners with his backwoods accomplishments and his   skills of improvisation. He was also quick to vent his apparent frustration with what he characterized as his sluggish, foolhardy and sometimes drunken fellow escapee, Mr. Matt. â\\x80\\x9cI got in an argument with him because every place weâ\\x80\\x99d go, heâ\\x80\\x99d get drunk,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sweat complained. â\\x80\\x9cAnd he would drink when we were moving. Iâ\\x80\\x99m like, â\\x80\\x98Dude, you canâ\\x80\\x99t be drunk when weâ\\x80\\x99re moving youâ\\x80\\x99ve got to be sober. â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d The two men found the transistor radio and a refrigerator full of beer at another cabin, Mr. Sweat told the investigators. And in addition to helping them keep track of where the authorities were searching for them, the radio also provided some measure of entertainment and satisfaction. â\\x80\\x9cIt was actually kind of a running joke between him and me because on the radio theyâ\\x80\\x99re like, â\\x80\\x98Oh theyâ\\x80\\x99re not woodsmen, this and that,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sweat said. â\\x80\\x9cAnd weâ\\x80\\x99d laugh about it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s funny   â\\x80¦     weâ\\x80\\x99re not woodsmen and weâ\\x80\\x99ve been in the woods for weeks. â\\x80\\x9d Then he gloated. â\\x80\\x9cThey canâ\\x80\\x99t catch us. But weâ\\x80\\x99re not woodsmen. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sweat said Mr. Matt, 49, had reckless ideas  â\\x80\\x94   shooting troopers, carjacking   on the rural roads or sticking people up in their homes and taking their money and cars. After two weeks, Mr. Matt began to wear on him. With their hunters in hot pursuit, Mr. Sweat left him behind. â\\x80\\x9cI said, you know what, I hate to do it to him, but I kept my part of the deal, I got him out,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cand I bolted on him. â\\x80\\x9d On June 26, a drunken Mr. Matt was confronted by a United States Border Patrol tactical unit, and, the authorities say, pointed a shotgun at one of its members. A federal agent shot him twice in the head and once in the neck. Two days later, Mr. Sweat was walking on a rural road just a mile and a half from the Canadian border when a sergeant in a State Police car approached him. Mr. Sweat believed the sergeant was confused because Mr. Sweat had shaved the night before as part of his plan for not looking like a haggard convict on the run. Mr. Sweat started to cross a field of alfalfa, heading for the tree line on the opposite side. The sergeant tried to call Mr. Sweat back to the road, saying, â\\x80\\x9cCome here. â\\x80\\x9d But Mr. Sweat responded with, â\\x80\\x9cNo, Iâ\\x80\\x99m good,â\\x80\\x9d and kept walking. He started moving faster. The sergeant swore at him. â\\x80\\x9cHe started running behind me,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sweat recalled. â\\x80\\x9cI took off. The next thing he says: â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to shoot you. If you donâ\\x80\\x99t stop, Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to shoot you.â\\x80\\x99 I said: â\\x80\\x98I ainâ\\x80\\x99t got no weapons. I donâ\\x80\\x99t have no weapons. â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sweat said he held his hands up so the trooper could see he was unarmed, but he kept running. The tree line got closer. He dropped the bag he was carrying. The sergeant got down on one knee, carefully set up his shot and fired. â\\x80\\x9cHe hit me twice and it was  â\\x80\\x94   the first one hit me in the shoulder the top,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sweat said. â\\x80\\x9cIt killed this whole arm. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t move it. And the other one was on the other side. I thought, â\\x80\\x98Man, Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to hit the ground,â\\x80\\x99 and just started spitting blood up. He hit my lung. â\\x80\\x9d After Mr. Sweat recovered, he pleaded guilty to   escape and promotion of prison contraband and was sentenced to three and a half to seven years in prison, on top of his    sentence for the 2002 killing of a Broome County sheriffâ\\x80\\x99s deputy. He is currently in the Special Housing Unit at Five Points Correctional Facility in Romulus, N. Y. the stateâ\\x80\\x99s newest   prison. Portions of Mr. Sweatâ\\x80\\x99s account could not be corroborated, with Mr. Matt, the only other witness to many of the events, dead. And while a report this summer by the state inspector general, Catherine   detailing the prison lapses that led to the escape in some measure relied on Mr. Sweatâ\\x80\\x99s account of the breakout itself, it acknowledged that questions would arise about his motivation and credibility. But the report noted that information he provided under oath had been corroborated, wherever possible, by other evidence, adding, â\\x80\\x9cIn instances where no independent corroboration exists, the inspector general has found Sweatâ\\x80\\x99s account credible and consistent with other known facts. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'In a recent interview with Fox News, Trump said that California is  out of control  for advancing legislation to provide statewide sanctuary for immigrants and keep law enforcement from cooperating with federal authorities in enforcing Trump s many anti-immigrant measures. Trump told Fox that he will take away every penny that California receives from the federal government.The state of California has one of the ten largest economies in the world. Not only is it a giant among states, competing with the economies of some of the most affluent countries worldwide, but it is one of the few states that pays more into the federal Treasury than it receives in government funding. It would be a huge mistake to put the state of California in a position that legislators may decide to stop paying taxes altogether, but Donald Trump seems determined to do just that because, well, he s an idiot. If we have to, we ll defund,  he said.  We give tremendous amounts of money to California. Thanks to the state s liberal policies, California has outpaced the rest of the nation on job growth and had a gross state product of 2.46 trillion in 2015, placing it sixth behind the United Kingdom in world economies (ranked by Gross Domestic Product) and 11th in the world ranked by cost of living.In other words, California would be fine without the federal money it receives if the state stopped paying taxes to the federal government. Officials are currently looking into doing exactly that if Trump follows through on his threat to take federal funding from the state. California could very well become an organized non-payer,  if Trump follows through on threats to punish cities and states that do not comply with requests to turn over Jews undocumented immigrants to Trump s goons, a former speaker of the state Assembly told KPIX 5 on Sunday.  They could recommend non-compliance with the federal tax code. I don t want to defund the state or city, I don t want to defund anybody, I want to give them the money they need to properly operate a city or a state,  Trump says, but  if they re going to have sanctuary cities we may have to do that   certainly that would be a weapon. Ir would be a weapon, but the federal government needs California s money more than the state needs funding from the government. This fact alone is enough to virtually assure that lawmakers will choose to defund Trump rather than violate their conscience and hand over people Trump has deemed  undesirable. Looks like Trump s threat has been called. It s time to find out if he is really stupid enough to try this kind of stunt.Read more:Featured image via Getty Images (Drew Angerer)',\n",
       " 'But then the sobering realization sets in: these are elected members of perhaps most prestigious governing body in the world.\\n\\nLet this sink in for a moment: each of these dolts is chosen by voters to be one of 535 elites who are tasked with authoring and voting on legislation that impacts the entire country and beyond. Think about that. Louie Gohmert, who once said the â\\x80\\x9cwall of separationâ\\x80\\x9d between church and state is â\\x80\\x9ca one way wall,â\\x80\\x9d whatever the hell that means, gets to vote on laws that could potentially and irreversibly alter the course of your life.\\n\\nOur only possible defense against being utterly confounded and horrified by the power granted to men and women who have no business wielding such power, is to laugh at their flaming stupidity. Otherwise, itâ\\x80\\x99d be way too easy lapse into inextricable despair and, in some cases, moron-induced alcoholism.\\n\\nIn spite of the rapid dumbing-down of the GOP (see also Mr. Trump), they continue to churn out more dummies.\\n\\nEnter Kevin McCarthy. The Bakersfield, California Republican is the most likely conservative white-guy to ascend into John Boehnerâ\\x80\\x99s post as Speaker of the House. And he shouldnâ\\x80\\x99tÂ\\xa0have beenÂ\\xa0allowed anywhere near Congress, much less a leadership post.\\n\\nBy now, weâ\\x80\\x99re all aware of McCarthyâ\\x80\\x99s admission that the congressional select committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks is almost exclusively designed to undermine Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s presidential aspirations.\\n\\nThey say gaffes are merely the truths spoken out loud. This was certainly the case with McCarthy. By the way, we should underscore at this point how McCarthy isnâ\\x80\\x99t just another ambitious member of Congress. Heâ\\x80\\x99s the House Majority Leader. So, yes, the House Majority Leader accidentally spilled the beans on one of the longest running scams in congressional history â\\x80\\x94 one of the biggest wastes of taxpayer money since Ken Starrâ\\x80\\x99s probe into President Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s pants-parties.\\n\\nEither McCarthy is incapable of reading, or he has the worst speech-writing staff in the history of American politics â\\x80\\x94 and that includes Sarah Palinâ\\x80\\x99s self-authored Patriotic Mad Libs. Three days after Boehner announced his resignation from Congress, McCarthy was propped up for a foreign policy speech before the John Hay Initiative. The ostensible goal wasÂ\\xa0to burnish McCarthyâ\\x80\\x99s political heft, but the exact opposite happened and, frankly, even the dumbest Republicans ought to be embarrassed to caucus with this idiot.\\n\\nHere are some highlights:\\n\\nWar of radical Islam? â\\x80\\x9cOnâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cagainstâ\\x80\\x9d makes more sense, of course. And shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be â\\x80\\x9clivesâ\\x80\\x9d and not â\\x80\\x9clife?â\\x80\\x9d Honestly, the rest of the quotes will make this passage seem comparatively Shakespearean.\\n\\nThereâ\\x80\\x99s no such phrase as â\\x80\\x9cstem a flow.â\\x80\\x9d Thereâ\\x80\\x99s something called â\\x80\\x9cstemflow.â\\x80\\x9d One can also stem the flow of something, which is possibly what he meant. But â\\x80\\x9cpolitically strategyâ\\x80\\x9d is just ridiculous.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have isolated Israel, while bolding places like Iran.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe absence of leadership over the past six years has had a horrific consequences all across the globe.â\\x80\\x9d Was anyone fired for this? How the hell is he still a contender for Speaker? â\\x80\\x9cIn the past few years alone, I have visited Poland, Hungria, Estonia, Russia and Georgiaâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d Hungria. Which is north of Freedonia and adjacent to that fake island where Balki from â\\x80\\x9cPerfect Strangersâ\\x80\\x9d came from. â\\x80\\x9cIt defies belief that the president would allow the ban on Iranian oil exports to be lifted. And also stand by while Russia blackmails an entire continent, all the while keeping the place of the band on America.â\\x80\\x9d I have no idea what any of that means. Which continent? Letâ\\x80\\x99s get real here: we should amend the Constitution so that when any elected politician mutilates the English language this badly, their desk chair turns into an ejector-seat that summarily launches them out of Congress. Letâ\\x80\\x99s get on this now before itâ\\x80\\x99s too late. â\\x80\\x9cWe donâ\\x80\\x99t have the same as difficult decision that this White House is managing the decline and putting us in tough decisions for the future.â\\x80\\x9d To be fair, gaffes are part of being a public figure. Spend enough time in front of a microphone and weird crap will inevitably fall out. However, a â\\x80\\x9cstem a flowâ\\x80\\x9d of gaffes like this is inexcusable for a leader whoâ\\x80\\x99s stepping into an office thatâ\\x80\\x99s two heartbeats away from the presidency. Again, was it his speechwriter? Was he unable to read the prepared remarks? Why was he incapable of correcting the remarks on-the-fly? Was he having a stroke? Even the party of George W. Bush and Sarah Palin should, in a sane world, stand up and in a unified voice block this nincompoop from becoming Speaker. They wonâ\\x80\\x99t, of course, and Boehner will likely hand his gavel over to the guy who, with a straight face, said he visited a place called â\\x80\\x9cHungria.â\\x80\\x9d The good news, on the other hand, is that weâ\\x80\\x99ll all have another GOP doofus to kick around for a while. Silver linings, etc. Ever since Karl Rove and the Bush administration systematically altered the political landscape making it perfectly acceptable to be completely incompetent and still get re-elected by low-information voters who think politicians shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be any smarter than the people who elect them: weâ\\x80\\x99ve mostly settled for idiots. Sadly, the demystification of the presidency and electoral politics has convinced us that anyone can hold these jobs and that leaders should be â\\x80\\x9cjust like us.â\\x80\\x9d Sorry, but the guy you might want to have a beer with shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t control the nuclear launch codes or the destiny of the free world. We should demand leaders who are devastatingly smart, engaged, disciplined, centered and intellectually curious. We should be gravitationally drawn to leaders with impeccable schooling and robust speaking skills. The salient question is this: Why donâ\\x80\\x99t Republicans want the same? Why are they so willing to settle for feckless trolls like Donald Trump or marble-mouthed dilettantes like Kevin McCarthy? It might be somewhat acceptable if they actually took responsibility for putting us all in tough decisions for the future, but the party of personalÂ\\xa0responsibility will never do that. And itâ\\x80\\x99s hurting America.',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump, Jr. seems to have taken over as his father s campaign s Supervisor of Offensive Posts, particularly with some of his most recent tweets. One was of a bowl of Skittles, and asked us the really asinine question of whether we d eat those Skittles if we knew three of them were poisoned, but not which ones. He s (rightfully) caught an awful lot of flack for that, but he likely didn t expect to catch it from the man who took that photo.He probably also didn t expect the photographer to be who he is: A refugee living in the U.K. David Kittos fled Turkish occupation of Cyprus in the 1970s and has been living in the U.K. ever since. He is (quite understandably) angry by Trump Jr. s misappropriation of his image to promote a xenophobic, racist and anti-refugee policy: This was not done with my permission, I don t support his politics and I would never take his money to use it.In 1974, when I was six-years old, I was a refugee from the Turkish occupation of Cyprus so I would never approve the use of this image against refugees. Oops. That s only a minor faux pas   oh wait. It s a major embarrassment to use an image that originates with a refugee to speak out against refugees.Kittos took the picture six years ago in his studio while he was experimenting with a specific type of flash. He s not on Twitter, but friends familiar with his work let him know of this unauthorized and offensive use of one of his photos, which does appear on Flickr.Just what is up with this campaign acting like copyright only applies to other people?We digress. Anyway.Kittos  photo was never intended for political use and he certainly would never release it or sell it for such usage. Trump Jr. and others, like the disgraceful former Congresscritter Joe Walsh, don t seem to care, though, as long as they can make their point that refugees are dangerous.Wrigley, the makers of Skittles candy, also upbraided Trump Jr. for his baloney: Skittles are candy. Refugees are people.We don t feel it is an appropriate analogy. We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing. For his part, Kittos isn t sure if he s going to pursue legal action. However, he did say: I would like the Trump campaign to delete the image, but they are probably not interested in what I have to say.I was thinking about getting lawyers involved but I don t know if I have the patience.This isn t about the money for me. They could have just bought a cheap image from a micro stock library. This is pure greed from them. I don t think they care about my feelings. They should not be stealing an image full stop. And they definitely need to learn how to source copyrighted work if they re the so-called  law and order campaign  that they claim to be. But that s beside the point. Kittos is, himself, a refugee. It s natural that he would feel especially upset by this use of his image. It also speaks to the insanely tone-deaf nature of the Trump campaign. They don t care about such trivia as long as their point is made.Featured image by John Sommers II/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'Donald Trump has suggested that women should face  some sort of punishment  for having an abortion. Ted Cruz just admitted that he wants to punish women for being raped.During an interview with Fox host Megyn Kelly, Cruz made it clear that he believes rape victims should be barred from terminating any pregnancy that results from the crime.Women  think you may be too far right on social issues,  Kelly told Cruz while pointing out that the GOP presidential wannabe s stance on abortion rights is repelling female voters away from a Republican Party that needs votes from women if it hopes to survive in November.But Ted Cruz refused to budge from his extremist views and openly stated that he believes rape victims should be forced to carry pregnancies that result from rape to term. Rape is a horrific crime against the humanity of a person. But at the same time, as horrible as the crime is, I don t believe it s the child s fault. We want to do every thing we can do to prevent the crime on the front end and to punish the criminal. But I don t believe it makes sense to blame the child. Kelly fired back by informing Cruz that women think he  would be forcing the mother to go through unspeakable trauma to carry her rapist s baby for nine months. On that point, Kelly is correct. Forcing a woman to endure nine grueling months of a pregnancy she did not want only helps the rapist torture his victim more, it rewards the rapist with a child. And in far too many states, a rapist can then sue for parental rights and would be able to harass the victim for the next 18 years of the child s life.Cruz, however, avoided replying to Kelly like the coward he is and dubiously claimed that the decision would be left to the states if Roe v. Wade were to ever be overturned. Here it would be a question for Wisconsin, what should the laws be governing abortion. If Roe v. Wade was not the law, it would be up to the people of Wisconsin and the people of Wisconsin might decide to allow some exceptions or not allow some exceptions because everyone agrees that you always want to protect the life of the mother. Here s the video:Ted Cruz is literally pretending that he would allow each state to have their own abortion laws. In December, Cruz stated his intention to ban abortion nationwide despite what the Supreme Court has ruled.Furthermore, Cruz has also voiced support for a federal ban on abortion after 20 weeks that provided zero exceptions for rape victims. He also supported the Life at Conception Act, which would ban all abortion for any reason and would even outlaw some forms of contraception.In short, Cruz is lying through his teeth when he claims that the states will be able to make their own abortion laws. As president, Cruz would absolutely sign a total ban on abortion if Republicans manage to hold onto the Senate and House after the election in November. In fact, it would probably be one of the first things he does. And that means women absolutely should not trust Ted Cruz. Featured image via screencapture',\n",
       " \"KUTUPALONG, Bangladesh/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Caught in the crossfire between Myanmar s military and Rohingya insurgents, hundreds of Hindus who have fled to Bangladesh are placing their hopes on the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in neighboring India. Nearly 500 are sheltered in a cleared-out chicken farm in a Hindu hamlet in Bangladesh s southeast, a couple of miles from where most of the 421,000 Rohingya Muslims who have also fled violence in Myanmar since Aug. 25 are living in makeshift camps. The Hindu refugees say they are scared of going back to their villages in Buddhist-majority Myanmar s restive Rakhine state, but also wary of staying in mostly Muslim Bangladesh. Modi s government, meanwhile, is making it easier for Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and other minorities from Bangladesh and Pakistan to gain citizenship in India.  India is also known as Hindustan, the land of the Hindus,  said Niranjan Rudra, sitting on a plastic sheet in the chicken farm flanked by his wife, who sported a large vermilion red dot on her forehead typical of married Hindu women.  We just want a peaceful life in India, not much. We may not get that in Myanmar or here,  he said. Fellow refugees nodded in agreement, stating that they wanted the message to reach the Indian government through the media. The Indian government declined to comment on the Hindu refugees  hopes. A government source said it was waiting while the Supreme Court hears an appeal against the home ministry s plans to deport around 40,000 Rohingya Muslims from the country. But Achintya Biswas, a senior member of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or the World Hindu Council, which has close ties with the ideological parent of Modi s ruling party, said India was the natural destination for the Hindus fleeing Myanmar.  Hindu families must be allowed to enter India by the government,  Biswas said by phone.  Where else will they go? This is their place of origin.  Biswas said the VHP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the umbrella group that mentors Modi s ruling party, would submit a report to the home ministry on the refugees and demand a new policy allowing Hindus from Myanmar and Bangladesh to seek asylum in India. The Hindu right who form the bedrock of Modi s support have long believed India is the home for all Hindus. India s Home Ministry spokesman K.S. Dhatwalia declined to comment. A senior home ministry official in New Delhi, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that no Hindu in Myanmar or Bangladesh affected by the violence had approached Indian authorities.  At this juncture we have no SOS calls from Hindus,  said the official.  Also, the Supreme Court is yet to decide whether India should deport Rohingya Muslims or not. The matter is sub-judice and any policy decision will be taken only after the court s order.  Hindus make up a small but long-standing minority in both Myanmar and Bangladesh. Refugee Rudra, a barber from Myanmar s Thit Tone Nar Gwa Son village, showed Reuters what he said was a temporary citizenship card issued in 1978 by the authorities there. The card listed his race as  Indian  and religion as  Hindu . Rudra and other Hindu refugees said they had fled soon after Rohingya insurgents attacked 30 Myanmar police posts, triggering a fierce military counteroffensive. Since then, rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population, leaving many villages in northern Rakhine empty.  Our village in Myanmar was surrounded by hundreds of men in black masks on the morning of Aug. 25,  said Veena Sheel, a mother-of-two whose husband works in Malaysia.  They called some men out and asked them to fight the security forces ... a few hours after we heard gunshots.  Sheel left the next day with eight other women and their families, walking for two days to reach Bangladesh.  There are so many people all around us. No peace here, no peace back in Myanmar,  said Sheel.  We should be taken to Hindustan, that s our land. Wherever we stay, we want to feel safe.  Since taking office in 2014, Modi's government has issued orders stating that no Hindu or member of another minority from Pakistan or Bangladesh would be considered an illegal immigrant even if they entered the country without valid documents on or before Dec. 31, 2014. (bit.ly/2f61Qxr) It also plans to nearly halve to six years the period Hindus, Christians and other minorities from those countries need to have lived in India to be granted citizenship by naturalization.  We are regularizing only those who have come due to religious persecution in Bangladesh and Pakistan,  junior home minister Kiren Rijiju told Reuters last month, adding that there was no policy on refugees from Myanmar. It will not be easy for secular India to accept the Myanmar Hindu refugees  demand while the government is pushing for the deportation of Rohingya Muslims. Modi s government has already been criticized by activists for not speaking out against Myanmar s military offensive, and accused of vilifying the Rohingya in the country to seek legal clearance for their deportation. \",\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special counsel Robert Muellerâ\\x80\\x99s team has questioned Sam Clovis, co-chairman of President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s election campaign, to  determine if Trump or top aides knew of the extent of the campaign teamâ\\x80\\x99s contacts with Russia, two sources familiar with the investigation said on Friday. The focus of the questions put to Clovis by Muellerâ\\x80\\x99s team has not been previously reported. â\\x80\\x9cThe ultimate question Mueller is after is whether candidate Trump and then President-elect Trump knew of the discussions going on with Russia, and who approved or even directed them,â\\x80\\x9d said one source. â\\x80\\x9cThat is still just a question.â\\x80\\x9d   Clovis testified in late October before the grand jury in Muellerâ\\x80\\x99s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He is also cooperating with the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the same issues. Contacted late on Friday, the White House declined to comment. One of the sources described Clovis as â\\x80\\x9canother dominoâ\\x80\\x9d after former campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI over his own contacts with Russians during the 2016 election campaign.  â\\x80\\x9cThe investigators now know what Papadopoulos was doing on the Russian front, which he initially tried to conceal, and who he told that to,â\\x80\\x9d said the other source. â\\x80\\x9cNow [they] want to know whether Clovis and others reported these activities and others related to Russia, and if so, to whom,â\\x80\\x9d this source said.  Attorneys for Clovis did not respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for Papadopoulos had no immediate comment. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment. According to court documents related to Papadopoulosâ\\x80\\x99 guilty plea, he reported to Clovis in an email on a March 24, 2016, meeting he had in London with a professor later identified as Joseph Mifsud. Mifsud in turn introduced him to a Russian woman and the Russian ambassador in London, and they discussed setting up meetings to talk about U.S.-Russia ties in a Trump presidency. The documents showed Clovis responded to the proposed meetings by saying he would â\\x80\\x9cwork it through the campaign.â\\x80\\x9d While he told Papadopoulos not to make a commitment then to set up those meetings, he congratulated him for â\\x80\\x9cgreat work.â\\x80\\x9d In August 2016, after Trump won the Republican presidential nomination, Clovis encouraged Papadopoulos to â\\x80\\x9cmake the tripâ\\x80\\x9d when Papadopoulos proposed going to an off-the-record meeting with unnamed Russian officials, the court documents show. Victoria Toensing, one of Clovisâ\\x80\\x99s lawyers, said last week her client â\\x80\\x9calways vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump and/or the campaignâ\\x80\\x9d. After Papadopoulosâ\\x80\\x99 guilty plea, the White House and former Trump campaign officials dismissed Papadopoulos and Clovis as minor figures in the campaign.  The campaignâ\\x80\\x99s National Security Advisory Committee, which Clovis formed, has become a focus of the investigations by both Mueller and the Senate, sources said. â\\x80\\x9cSam built the first group of eight,â\\x80\\x9d J.D. Gordon, the director of the campaign foreign policy group, told Reuters, adding that he and then-Senator Jeff Sessions, now the U.S. Attorney General, had â\\x80\\x9cnearly doubledâ\\x80\\x9d it in size. However, two other sources familiar with the investigations said investigators have been told the committee Clovis formed did very little, and that other advisers appeared to carry more weight with Trump.

So much fun. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cFirst of all, how beautiful is Jennifer,â\\x80\\x9d Trump asks, claiming ownership of Jennifer as an object while playing magnanimous daddy who dishes out praise and approval before the spanking. The message: He can make or break her. She better play nice. \\nWarning shot, â\\x80\\x9cThis is about getting even.â\\x80\\x9d \\nTrump tells the audience that he was mad at Hawkins because she allegedly dissed him by declining to introduce him at the event in Sydney. He tells the audience how mad he was, and then says, as sheâ\\x80\\x99s crossing the stage, â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s my favorite Miss Universe.â\\x80\\x9d So she thinks maybe this isnâ\\x80\\x99t going to be as bad as she fears. \\nBut then he stabs her publicly for the first time, â\\x80\\x9cBut I think I like the new one better.â\\x80\\x9d \\nThe audience loves it. He is going to feed them the sexual humiliation of a beautiful woman because she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a good girl. She reaches him and they clasp hands while she smiles through the shame knowing she has no choice and wanting to be a good sport. \\nHawkins tries to make light of the situation while appeasing Trump, playing along with his game because she has to, but there will be no easy way out of this one. It wonâ\\x80\\x99t be enough to fawn over him in front of the audience. She will have to pay. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was actually going to get up and tell you that Jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but sheâ\\x80\\x99s not very bright,â\\x80\\x9d Trump tells the audience, signaling that Hawkins is a piece of meat to be dissected by him publicly for her refusal to give him anything he asks for. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been true, but I would have said it anyway,â\\x80\\x9d Trump proudly tells the audience. This is his alpha male routine, except in real life, the alpha male doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have to abuse money and power he inherited in order to win the girl. But in the mind of little men like Trump, this makes him a winner. \\nTrump points out that Hawkins is a big star now, but he helped her make it and then dissed him. He owns her. She must comply or face his wrath. Hawkins tries to say that she did introduce him, but Trump pushes her away from the microphone. This public shaming will be done from Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s POV only. No need for Hawkins to assert her personhood.There will be no defense allowed, because sheâ\\x80\\x99s already guilty. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you know what? She came tonight, she came â\\x80\\x94 came, she came, she came,â\\x80\\x9d Trump says gleefully like the drunk pervy uncle everyone tries to avoid at Christmas. He waits for the audience to join him in his sexual shaming, and they do. They get it. Hee heee. So clever. Came. Knuckles dragging on the floor clever. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cSee, so they have the same filthy minds in Australia,â\\x80\\x9d Trump says. \\nTrump grabs Hawkins around the waist and forces a kiss on her, just like he bragged about doing on the Bush tape. \\nHawkins reflexively turns away and puts her arm between them. The kiss misses its mark and lands on her cheek. She is hoping this is good enough humiliation for him, but putting her foot down on actual mouth contact. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s allowed herself to be publicly humiliated to appease him, and pretended to fawn over him as required, but she will not, cannot, allow the kiss. The repulsive kiss. \\nIâ\\x80\\x99m telling this story as I imagine it to be from her point of view, although she has refused to comment. Of course she refused to comment, women are told they will be blackballed if they comment. The world is full of men like Trump, and they stick together. See Roger Ailes. Women have to play along and appease and if that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t work, they have to allow themselves to be sexually assaulted and humiliated just a little bit in public, especially if they said no in private. \\nI can only do this because I have lived it, somewhat like this, in public. And I have tried to appease the ego of the assaulter in order to keep my job, while denying him his assumed entitlement to my body. \\nFrom talking to so many women during this election, I know that Iâ\\x80\\x99m not alone. I know that many other women will watch this and know. They will feel the creep of fear and revulsion, the deer in the headlights cringe that takes over when you know that you are about to be humiliated as a sexual object because you refused him or refused to appease the ego of the powerful man in charge by behaving like a sexual conquest. How dare Hawkins have her own life and be unwilling to change all of her plans in order to introduce Trump. \\nAnd other people will watch this humiliation and enjoy it, setting you up to be humiliated even more. They will laugh about it and gossip about it, which is the social punishment women face when they reject a man like Trump. Ironically, if you give in youâ\\x80\\x99re not humiliated. Itâ\\x80\\x99s only if you say no that you are set up to be publicly flogged as a sex object. \\nItâ\\x80\\x99s not just the unwanted kiss, although that is disgusting and assault, much like Donald Trump bragged about doing on the Billy Bush bus tape. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the public humiliation and denigration. \\nItâ\\x80\\x99s the way the woman is forced, in front of thousands of people, to try to smile her way through his ambush of verbal and physical assaults as he takes revenge. \\nItâ\\x80\\x99s the way she tries to make it okay, to sweet-smooth his ego in order to get out of the line of fire, and in return he shames her by suggesting he made her â\\x80\\x9ccomeâ\\x80\\x9d and then grabs her for an unwanted kiss. \\nIf there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the Trump candidacy, perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people, and that this kind of thing is horrific but itâ\\x80\\x99s not all Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s fault. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the cultureâ\\x80\\x99s fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman. \\nIn fact, this is shades of what Trump did to Hillary Clinton in the stalking debate, after which he announced that looking at her from behind he was not impressed. \\nNeither are we by you, Mr. Trump. Neither are we.',\n",
       " 'One of the nationâ\\x80\\x99s largest road racing organizations plans to expand its testing for   drugs to include the top runners in its local races, not just those in its   events. For more than a decade, the organization, New York Road Runners, has tested elite runners in the New York City Marathon, its largest and   race, and its other professional events. Runners found to have cheated are disqualified, and their prize money is withheld. Runners who previously tested positive for   drugs are ineligible to run. The new effort, scheduled to begin in the spring of 2017, will test the top local and club runners  â\\x80\\x94   the tier below the level of   professionals. It is part of the organizationâ\\x80\\x99s efforts to ensure a level playing field at more of its races while increasing awareness of the dangers of using   drugs. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s meant for guys running up front in the local races,â\\x80\\x9d said Peter Ciaccia, the president of events at New York Road Runners and the race director of the marathon, the largest in the country. â\\x80\\x9cThe idea is to just throw out a wider net. â\\x80\\x9d New York Road Runners already spends $100, 000 a year testing its professional runners. That money covers the cost of setting up secure areas to obtain samples and shipping them to laboratories to be analyzed, a process that takes about six weeks. The organizationâ\\x80\\x99s officials also monitor race results to see if any runners run noticeably faster over a short time. The group will spend another $100, 000 or so in the first year to expand its testing program. As it does with its professional runners, the organization will pay the United States   Agency to randomly select a small group of top local runners to be tested at races. Road Runners awards about $130, 000 a year in prize money to members and club runners in its local races. Any runners in that category who test positive will forfeit their prize money. When they register for races, runners must sign waivers in which they agree to be tested, if chosen. Runners can appeal a positive test result. They can also apply for a   exemption if they take medicine that may contain banned ingredients. Ciaccia said the decision to expand testing had not been driven by a specific instance of a runnerâ\\x80\\x99s being caught taking a banned substance. Instead, he said, his organization wants to alert runners of all ages to the dangers of   drugs. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not just about the brand integrity, but also the educational component so young kids understand what they might get themselves into,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Antidoping experts applauded the effort. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s always worth extending the testing experience, thatâ\\x80\\x99s for sure,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. Don Catlin, the former director of the U. C. L. A. Olympic Analytical Laboratory. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a limited number of tests done for events, so itâ\\x80\\x99s always best to increase the numbers and get runners tested more. â\\x80\\x9d In a statement, Travis T. Tygart, the chief executive of Usada, said he hoped more sports organizations would follow the clubâ\\x80\\x99s lead. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s fantastic and shows great commitment and leadership to ensuring a level playing field, where clean athletes can compete clean and win,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Club runners in the New York area said that the hassle of extra testing was a small price to pay to weed out potential cheaters, no matter how few there were and how little the prize money. â\\x80\\x9cI very much think drug testing has to be part of the sport at almost every level,â\\x80\\x9d said John Roberts, the president of the Central Park Track Club, who was briefed on New York Road Runnersâ\\x80\\x99 plans. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s unfortunate that thatâ\\x80\\x99s where things have gotten. But I canâ\\x80\\x99t think of any reason not to do it, except inconvenience. â\\x80\\x9d The extra time spent analyzing the test results, though, is likely to increase the time it takes to distribute prize money, something that concerns runners who already wait for months to receive checks from the club. â\\x80\\x9cIt takes months for them to pay out $500 in prize money, so it will now take longer,â\\x80\\x9d said William du Pont Staab Jr. the president of the West Side Runners Club. â\\x80\\x9cOur runners, they can use their money for their rent. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It was classic Hillary Clinton, ignoring medical advice and attending a ceremony on a sultry New York City day while battling pneumonia - a decision ex-aides and other associates speculated was rooted in her longstanding desire to prove that women can compete in the male-dominated world of politics. The move backfired on the famously stoic Democratic presidential candidate after she had to leave Sundayâ\\x80\\x99s September. 11 remembrance early and was caught on camera buckling from dehydration as she was helped into a van.  Clinton, 68, has since acknowledged she went too far in trying to soldier on with a jam-packed schedule. Daniel Scherb, a South Bend, Indiana, cardiologist interviewed by Reuters, who was not privy to Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s medical records, said pneumonia can leave a patient â\\x80\\x9cfeeling blah for seven to 10 daysâ\\x80\\x9d under the best of circumstances and, at worst, â\\x80\\x9cpeople can die from it.â\\x80\\x9d Former subordinates who are fiercely loyal to Clinton said there are plenty of instances in which she drove herself remarkably hard as first lady from 1993-2001, as a U.S. senator from 2001-2009 and as U.S. secretary of state from 2009-2013. In her first year at the State Department in 2009, she traveled abroad extensively shortly after undergoing surgery for a broken arm. One retired ambassador said Clinton sees herself as part of a generation of women who had to work extra hard to overcome barriers to female advancement. The ambassador describes this as part of an ethos that â\\x80\\x9cyou could never be weaker than a man.â\\x80\\x9d At the same time, the ambassador blamed Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s aides in part for allowing her to put herself into difficult situations. At an event in Congo after breaking her arm, Clinton snapped at someone who posed a question she disliked, the ambassador recalled. While the question may have been translated into English incorrectly, the ambassador said Clinton also was clearly exhausted. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not necessarily that she is running roughshod over the advice of her staff. Her staff doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to take very good care of her,â\\x80\\x9d the ambassador said. Working to defeat Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, 70, on the rough-and-tumble campaign trail, Clinton has said she is held to a different standard. â\\x80\\x9cWomen are seen through a different lens,â\\x80\\x9d Clinton told Humans of New York, a group organized around a project to photograph and catalog stories of New Yorkers. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve learned that I canâ\\x80\\x99t be quite so passionate in my presentation,â\\x80\\x9d she said, adding, â\\x80\\x9cI love to wave my arms, but apparently thatâ\\x80\\x99s a little bit scary to people.Â\\xa0And I canâ\\x80\\x99t yell too much. It comes across as â\\x80\\x98too loudâ\\x80\\x99 or â\\x80\\x98too shrillâ\\x80\\x99 or â\\x80\\x98too thisâ\\x80\\x99 or â\\x80\\x98too that,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d even though those attending her rallies â\\x80\\x9care loving it.â\\x80\\x9d In all her roles, including as President Bill Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s healthcare chief and a two-time presidential candidate, Clinton has been known as an almost unstoppable, detail-oriented policy wonk. â\\x80\\x9cHer constant work, internal in meetings or external on Capitol Hill, was virtually incomprehensible,â\\x80\\x9d said David Dreyer, a White House deputy communications director during Bill Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s first term. Dreyer, who said he had a â\\x80\\x9cfront row seatâ\\x80\\x9d to the healthcare reform fight that Hillary Clinton spearheaded as first lady, said she is â\\x80\\x9cwiredâ\\x80\\x9d to always be fully prepared and compelled to public service. â\\x80\\x98CANâ\\x80\\x99T-WIN SITUATIONâ\\x80\\x99 Three other people, one close to Clinton when she was secretary of state and as a presidential candidate, said efforts to persuade her to temper her travel and appearance schedule can go nowhere because she insists it is expected of her. One, a prominent former official who has advised Clinton on foreign policy issues, said: â\\x80\\x9cShe pushes herself so hard because sheâ\\x80\\x99s convinced that only she can do what needs to be done, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s compounded by a very small inner circle that in some cases doesnâ\\x80\\x99t like to contradict or confront her, and as a result just ends up encouraging this compulsion.â\\x80\\x9d Matt Bennett, who served as deputy assistant for intergovernmental affairs in Bill Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s second presidential term, said Hillary Clinton is â\\x80\\x9cin a canâ\\x80\\x99t-win situation here.â\\x80\\x9d Noting competing, unsubstantiated attacks from Trump and his supporters about her health versus criticisms that she does not know how to pace herself, â\\x80\\x9cEither she is frail or reckless with her health.â\\x80\\x9d Bennett added, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t view her as disregarding medical adviceâ\\x80\\x9d over past blood clots, a fall that caused a concussion and other maladies. â\\x80\\x9cBut I do think sheâ\\x80\\x99s super tough.â\\x80\\x9d Bennett, now a vice president at the Third Way think tank, said the increasingly frantic pace of campaigning for the White House has pressed candidates to the limit. As an aide to retired General Wesley Clark while he unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004, Bennett noted that Clark would constantly remark about the rigors of the campaign. â\\x80\\x9cHe was shot multiple times in Vietnam and went through (elite Army) Ranger training and heâ\\x80\\x99s saying this is really tough running for president.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",

       " 'Donald Trump is throwing a hissy fit because Democrats are blocking many of his Cabinet nominees. But he should be blaming Republicans instead.Trump has chosen nominees who want to destroy the departments they have been picked to lead and they are mostly unqualified to hold the positions.But those are not the only reasons why Democrats are putting up a fight.For eight years, Republicans frequently obstructed President Obama s nominees and any legislation Democrats proposed. And for nearly a whole year, Republicans blocked Obama s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland from taking his rightful place on the high court.The obstruction was unprecedented in American history, yet Republicans and Trump are whining because Democrats are doing the exact same thing to them. .On Tuesday, Trump took to Twitter to complain like a hypocrite.It is a disgrace that my full Cabinet is still not in place, the longest such delay in the history of our country. Obstruction by Democrats!  Donald J.

Garland was also considered a moderate choice for the court. Furthermore, Republicans blocked an Obama nominee for years from taking her place as Ambassador to the Bahamas and she died waiting to serve her country.So while Republicans are throwing a temper tantrum over Democratic obstruction, they really only have themselves to blame. For eight years, they viciously blocked legislation and nominees because they hated President Obama. And they hated him because he has black skin. If Donald Trump wants to bitch about obstructionism he should blame Republicans for setting the precedent.Also, Trump is lying because President Obama didn t have his full Cabinet in place until April.And Twitter was quick to remind him of it.@realDonaldTrump This is what happens when your party sets a new standard for obstructionism   the other side has to escalate to compensate.

       " 'DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s struggle in Iowa to fend off underdog Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, reignited questions about her ability to close the deal with Democratic voters and turned up the pressure on her high-profile White House campaign. The Democratic presidential front-runner, whose campaign ran off the rails in Iowa in 2008 against Barack Obama, was dealt another setback on Monday in the Midwestern state that begins the 2016 race for the presidency. The former secretary of state, Clinton, 68, was pushed to a virtual tie with Sanders, a 74-year-old U.S. senator from Vermont. Next up is New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Feb. 9. Sanders has been leading in opinion polls there and has an advantage because it neighbors his home state. A Clinton loss would start to set off alarm bells with her supporters. â\\x80\\x9cShe has had every possible structural and organizational advantage and Sanders fought her to a draw,â\\x80\\x9d said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. â\\x80\\x9cThis is almost a moment by moment rerun of 2008,â\\x80\\x9d Schnur said. â\\x80\\x9cThe difference is her competition is not as tough this time.â\\x80\\x9d Clinton insisted at her post-caucus rally that she was the candidate who could unify her party and prevail against a Republican challenger in the Nov. 8 election but the sense of disappointment was palpable. Her subdued, six-minute speech contrasted with the ebullient tone of Sandersâ\\x80\\x99 16-minute speech.  With no clear victory to announce, Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s campaign scrapped a plan to have her daughter Chelsea and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, introduce her. They stood alongside her instead, with Bill Clinton wearing his campaign logo badge upside-down. Aides removed the TelePrompter at the last minute, supporters at the Drake University rally told Reuters, in a further indication of last-minute changes in plans. While the race in Iowa had tightened in recent weeks, her aides had appeared to draw some confidence from a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg politics poll over the weekend that showed Clinton with a three-percentage-point lead over Sanders among likely caucus-goers. Into the early hours of Tuesday morning, Clinton and Sanders remained separated by less than a single percentage point. The race was so tight that several precincts were forced to decide whether Clinton or Sanders got the winning votes - and one more delegate - by a coin toss, following the state Democratic Partyâ\\x80\\x99s advice. The MSNBC television network finally called the race for Clinton at nearly 3 a.m. CST (0900 GMT), and Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s Iowa state director Matt Paul issued a statement declaring victory with â\\x80\\x9cno uncertainty.â\\x80\\x9d Opinion polls show Clinton still faces an enthusiasm gap with Sanders and her Republican rivals, whose race attracted a record turnout in Iowa. Voters have persistent doubts about her honesty and trustworthiness after months of controversy over her use of a private email server for government work while secretary of state. Sanders, who launched his campaign nine months ago with a small, sparsely attended news conference on Capitol Hill, has excited liberal activists with an anti-establishment message that calls for eradicating income inequality, breaking up the big banks and providing free college tuition. Iowa was a good state to test that message, given the heavy liberal bent of the Democratic activists who dominate the caucus process. Entrance polls of Iowa caucus-goers showed 68 percent described themselves as very or somewhat liberal. Fundraising figures reported on Sunday by Sanders underscored the extent to which his campaign has grown into a popular movement. Clinton has raised more than Sanders - her campaign brought in $109 million last year compared to his $73.5 million. But 75 percent of his haul came from donations of $200 or less, in contrast to only 18 percent of Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s, and far more of Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s donors have hit the $2,700 donation limit. Still, Sanders faces significant challenges when the Democratic nominating contest moves to the more diverse states of Nevada and South Carolina before expanding to 11 states on March 1, â\\x80\\x9cSuper Tuesday,â\\x80\\x9d including seven in the South where Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s advantage with African-American voters could begin to pay off. â\\x80\\x9cIowa was built for Bernie Sanders,â\\x80\\x9d said Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, who nevertheless said the strong showing by Sanders means â\\x80\\x9cthis race goes on longer than Clinton wanted it to.â\\x80\\x9d  (Additional reporting by Jonathan Allen in Washington; Editing by Caren Bohan and Howard Goller) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.',\n",
       " 'Are these faux blacks cashing in on victim status or simply taking white guilt too far?An investigative blogger has accused Shaun King, a key figure in the Black Lives Matter movement, of misleading media icon Oprah Winfrey by pretending to be biracial in order to qualify for an  Oprah scholarship  to historically black Morehouse College. The blogger says King is white and has been lying about his ethnicity for years. King is a high-profile campaigner against  police brutality  and  justice correspondent  for the liberal Daily Kos website who told Rebel magazine in 2012 that he was biracial, with the magazine reporting that he is the  son of a Caucasian mother and an African-American father.  He has also described himself as  mixed with a black family  on Twitter.King has been lionised by the press, praised as hero of civil rights and social activism. He has written extensively about a childhood in which he was terrorised by  decades old racial tensions.  He claims to have been  the focus of constant abuse of the resident rednecks of my school. Yet, in recent weeks, rumours have been circulating about his ethnicity. A 1995 police incident report lists Shaun King s ethnicity as white. And blogger Vicki Pate, who has been assembling forensic accounts of Shaun King s background and family tree on her blog,  Re-NewsIt!,  has published her findings.She claims that King is entirely white and says a birth certificate, which Breitbart has since independently acquired from the Kentucky Office of Vital Statistics, names a white man as his father. King s case echoes that of Rachel Dolezal, a civil rights activist from Washington who claimed to be biracial while in fact being of caucasian origin. Dolezal continues to insist she  identifies as black,  despite her parents revealing that she is entirely white.If Pate is right, Shaun King, who often uses black and white photographs of himself online rather than colour images, may have misled African-American hero Winfrey by applying for and accepting an Oprah Scholarship to the historically black Morehouse College. Oprah Scholarships are given exclusively to black men.In his Daily Kos diary, King refers to himself as a  brother,  writing:  Oprah Winfrey paid my way through Morehouse. The leadership scholarship that I received from her is why I have a college degree today. Five hundred other brothers have the exact same story. Shaun King s biography has attracted the attention of bloggers and journalists thanks to several bizarre inconsistencies in his public claims. He often struggles when asked to recall basic facts about his own life. For instance, in August 2014, King wrote on Twitter that he was father to three  black girls,  while, six months earlier, he claimed to be father to four.It is of course possible that a family tragedy is responsible for the inconsistency, but the unexplained change in biographical details is not a one-off. In October 2009, King claimed to have endured four spinal surgeries. By February 2010, the number of surgeries had shrunk to three. There is also some confusion about when an alleged car crash may or may not have happened.As it turns out, these explosive new racial allegations are just the latest in a string of controversies surrounding Shaun King: on July 21, a conservative blog reported that his account of a  brutal, racially-motivated beating  in 1995, which at least two reports have described as  Kentucky s first hate crime,  did not match up with a police report from the case. King, 35, has related the story of the hate crime on his blogs and in his recent self-help book, seemingly to bolster his credibility as an activist and as a self-help guru,  wrote the Daily Caller s Chuck Ross.  While King has said that he was attacked by up to a dozen  racist  and  redneck  students, official records show that the altercation involved only one other student. And while King has claimed that he suffered a  brutal  beating that left him clinging to life, the police report characterized King s injuries as  minor,  Ross reported.This month, more details have emerged from King s account that do not match up with the police report or eyewitness accounts from journalists who noticed that King s public claims did not square with reality.Remarkably, King s own publication the Daily Kos, at which he is listed as a staff writer, ran a provocatively titled blog post in July of this year:  Is there something fishy about Shaun King?  The post alleged that people had been asking questions about King for some time and linked to the earlier Daily Caller report. While I know that it s in a right-wing publication, there was something that prevented me from instantly dismissing the article   I ve seen a number of people on Daily Kos complain that Shaun plays fast and loose with the truth,  wrote contributor Burt Miles.  So I started to do some digging on the Internet and found a lot of information which, if true, makes me very concerned about Shaun, his motives, and how his actions could reflect badly on this site and be used to smear the Black Lives Matter movement. Miles continued:  Is there anything to all this, or is it some kind of organized smear campaign? And, if it is a smear campaign, how does it involve so many different sites, publications and individuals? It was around the same time that Breitbart contacted Vicki Pate, who has been investigating King s claims for several years. Pate provided key documents that appear to show that King has two white parents and that he has been lying to the public about his race. Here is a picture of Shaun King (left) with his mother and brother(left) via: RenewsitOne of them is his birth certificate, listing his parents as Naomi Kay Fleming and Jeffery Wayne King and a birth date of September 17, 1979 in Versailles, Kentucky. King had already told journalists his mother was white. So all that remained for Pate to determine was whether his father was white too.King has always claimed that his father is black. But King s father, Jeffery, is white, says Pate. She points to a man born 11 November 1955 in Campbell, Kentucky who has been the subject of multiple arrests, including for motoring and drug offences. That birth date would make him 23 at the time of Shaun King s birth, the same age given on Shaun s birth certificate.The Jeffery Wayne King whose name and date of birth concord with Shaun King s birth certificate is pictured below, in a 2007 police mug shot. Various documents give his name as  Jeffery  and  Jeffrey  Wayne King, names which are common variants of one another, but King Snr s date of birth and place of residence is the same in all records. Jeffrey King, King s alleged father, who he has claimed in the past is black (top); King s brother Jason is pictured (bottom)What s more, Pate says she has definitively linked the man pictured in these mugshots to Shaun King via Shaun s brother, Kentucky Air Guard Russ King, who is also clearly caucasian. Finally, public records show only one J Wayne King in the state.By 2015, Shaun King had finessed his account of growing up black and suffering discrimination.  I was raised in rural Kentucky,  he told the blog Generation Progress.  It was actually pretty rough. African Americans faced a lot of racism and discrimination growing up. I never really experienced overt racism myself until high school,  he claimed. I was put into a weird position when a huge group of students (who called themselves  rednecks ) hated me for no reason. King must have known while giving interviews as late as 2015 that Vicki Pate was tracking down his family history. But he continued to deliver craftily-worded answers to interview questions that gave the impression he was a person of color and that he had been the victim of hate crimes.Neither is true, says Pate. She told Breitbart last night that King has never denied her accusations.  Shaun King has not denied the story to me, or anyone else, as far as I know,  she said.  Whenever it is mentioned on Twitter he simply blocks whoever is asking and reports them for  harassment.  He did reply to one person but only to say,  Haters gonna hate.  I myself have been suspended from Twitter just for posing the question. Via: Breitbart News',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One thing is definitely going right for U.S. President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress: they are steadily getting conservatives appointed as judges, advancing their long-held ambition of reshaping the federal judiciary. So concern among conservatives arose after Democrats swept to victory in state and local elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere this month, signaling potential trouble for Republicans in the November 2018 mid-term elections in which control over Congress is at stake. If the partyâ\\x80\\x99s slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, which reviews and confirms federal judicial nominees, is at risk, Republicans may need to move even more quickly on getting judges confirmed by the Senate for their lifetime posts, some legal experts said. â\\x80\\x9cObviously, who gets nominated and the pace of confirmations ... changes dramatically if the Senate were to flip back to the Democrats,â\\x80\\x9d said John Malcolm, a former Justice Department lawyer and now an analyst at the Heritage Foundation conservative think tank in Washington. Republicans â\\x80\\x9cshould be paying particular attention to pushing through as many nominees as they can,â\\x80\\x9d added Malcolm, also active in the Federalist Society, a conservative lawyersâ\\x80\\x99 group whose members have frequently been tapped for judicial posts by Republican presidents.  Trump and congressional Republicans have not passed any major legislation since he took office in January despite controlling the White House and Congress. But after a slow start that had worried conservative activists, Republicans have made major headway on judicial appointments in recent weeks. The Senate has now voted to confirm 14 Trump judicial nominees, including Donald Coggins on Thursday as a district judge in South Carolina. That includes Supreme Court appointee Neil Gorsuch, eight others on regional appeals courts ranking just below the Supreme Court and five on trial courts. Obama had only seven confirmed at this point in his presidency. Democrats, who accused Republicans of impeding nominations from Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, have said Republicans are trying to ram Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s nominees through the Senate, including some they say lack basic qualifications. Conservative groups that just last month were criticizing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for the pace of confirmations are now applauding him. McConnell, in a move with little precedent in U.S. history, last year refused to act on Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, paving the way for Trump to restore the high courtâ\\x80\\x99s conservative majority with Gorsuchâ\\x80\\x99s appointment. â\\x80\\x9cWhen the history books are written about the Trump administration, I believe perhaps the most long-lasting and significant legacy will be the men and women appointed and confirmed to the federal bench,â\\x80\\x9d Republican Senator Ted Cruz said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday.  Trump has a unique opportunity to reshape the judiciary. He inherited more than 100 vacancies when he took office, twice the number Obama inherited. The number has since climbed above 160.  Trump generally has selected deeply conservative nominees, many in their 40s and 50s and able to serve for decades. He could name up to 30 percent of the federal bench in his first four-year term, said Leonard Leo, a Trump advisor on judicial nominations. Having a more conservative judiciary could be pivotal on legal disputes involving presidential powers, abortion, the death penalty, religious rights, gay rights, litigation involving corporations and other matters. The main impact of this infusion of conservative jurists will be to flip the ideological breakdown of several liberal-leaning federal appeals courts, said political scientist Sheldon Goldman, an expert in judicial selection at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  Federal appeals courts, divided into 11 geographic regions plus two based in Washington, often have the final say in major legal disputes because the Supreme Court hears only a small number of cases annually.  During Wednesdayâ\\x80\\x99s Judiciary Committee hearing for six Trump judicial nominees, Democrats said Republicans were acting on too many too quickly, preventing proper questioning of the candidates. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s appointees may be more reliably conservative than those of previous Republican presidents. Goldman said nearly all have a connection to the Federalist Society, providing a â\\x80\\x9cvery consistent ideological vetting process.â\\x80\\x9d Leo, the societyâ\\x80\\x99s executive vice president, helped compile a shortlist of Supreme Court nominees for Trump that included Gorsuch. Judges will be a focus of the societyâ\\x80\\x99s national convention that started on Thursday in Washington, with Trump selections including Gorsuch due to appear. While Republican lawmakers have been divided over legislation on issues including taxes and healthcare, judicial nominees are an issue on which tend to agree. â\\x80\\x9cFixing Obamacare is no easy task,â\\x80\\x9d said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network conservative legal advocacy group, â\\x80\\x9cwhereas the president has done such an excellent job of choosing nominees that itâ\\x80\\x99s a no-brainer.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",

       " 'Let nobody tell you racists don t have options this election. If you re a racist who is turned off by Trump   or perhaps, fired from his campaign   you can always jump onto the Cruz train and fit right in.That s what former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg discovered when he was abruptly fired from Trump s campaign for the impressive feat of being too racist for Trump. He didn t have to stay out in the cold for very long, now he s shilling for Cruz.In an exclusive with POLITICO, Nunberg completed his 180 degree spin on Trump and now says Cruz is the only choice for president. Cruz is a Reagan Conservative. Donald Trump does not have a coherent political ideology   if anything, I would describe him as a Chris Christie Republican.   When did I decide that I could no longer support Trump? Last fall, when he did not have any idea of what the nuclear triad is in a debate. Actually, he didn t  decide  when he should stop supporting Trump   he was fired by Trump for a series of vile Facebook posts targeting President Obama, African Americans, and liberals with racist, violent rhetoric. In 2007, he called Civil Rights Leader Al Sharpton s daughter the N-word.He frequently referred to Obama as a  Socialist Marxist Islamo Fascist Nazi Appeaser  or a  Pan Arabist Marxist Muslim.  He is also   of course   a rabid birther. His comments were so noxious, that Trump was forced to part ways with him.And now he s Team Cruz and he has a completely different versions of events. Hilariously, he told POLITICO that it was Trump s failure to denounce (fellow) white supremacist David Duke as part of what led him to have a falling out with Trump. Apparently Nunberg believes in firing him, Trump got rid of the wrong racist in his campaign.Nunberg s effortless shift to Cruz only reinforces what many critics have been saying all along: The  vote Cruz to stop Trump  movement within the Republican Party, endorsed by moderates like Mitt Romney, isn t picking the  lesser  of two evils. Both candidates are shockingly bad options, and vile in their own ways. Voting for either means resigning the Republican Party to its worst elements: Racism, xenophobia, religious fanaticism and war-mongering. The choice isn t between Trump and Cruz, it s between either and decency.Republicans should work on building a party that Nunberg feels uncomfortable in. He shouldn t have options to choose from, he should be left out completely.Featured image via Talking Points Memo ',\n",
       " 'Robert O. Work, the veteran defense official retained as deputy secretary by President Trump, calls them his â\\x80\\x9cA. I. dudes. â\\x80\\x9d The breezy moniker belies their serious task: The dudes have been a kitchen cabinet of sorts, and have advised Mr. Work as he has sought to reshape warfare by bringing artificial intelligence to the battlefield. Last spring, he asked, â\\x80\\x9cO. K. you guys are the smartest guys in A. I. right?â\\x80\\x9d No, the dudes told him, â\\x80\\x9cthe smartest guys are at Facebook and Google,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Work recalled in an interview. Now, increasingly, theyâ\\x80\\x99re also in China. The United States no longer has a strategic monopoly on the technology, which is widely seen as the key factor in the next generation of warfare. The Pentagonâ\\x80\\x99s plan to bring A. I. to the military is taking shape as Chinese researchers assert themselves in the nascent technology field. And that shift is reflected in surprising commercial advances in artificial intelligence among Chinese companies. Last year, for example, Microsoft researchers proclaimed that the company had created software capable of matching human skills in understanding speech. Although they boasted that they had outperformed their United States competitors, a   A. I. researcher who leads a Silicon Valley laboratory for the Chinese web services company Baidu gently taunted Microsoft, noting that Baidu had achieved similar accuracy with the Chinese language two years earlier. That, in a nutshell, is the challenge the United States faces as it embarks on a new military strategy founded on the assumption of its continued superiority in technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence. First announced last year by Ashton B. Carter, President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s defense secretary, the â\\x80\\x9cThird Offsetâ\\x80\\x9d strategy provides a formula for maintaining a military advantage in the face of a renewed rivalry with China and Russia. Well into the 1960s, the United States held a military advantage based on technological leadership in nuclear weapons. In the 1970s, that perceived lead shifted to smart weapons, based on   Silicon Valley technologies like computer chips. Now, the nationâ\\x80\\x99s leaders plan on retaining that military advantage with a significant commitment to artificial intelligence and robotic weapons. But the global technology balance of power is shifting. From the 1950s through the 1980s, the United States carefully guarded its advantage. It led the world in computer and material science technology, and it jealously hoarded its leadership with military secrecy and export controls. In the late 1980s, the emergence of the inexpensive and universally available microchip upended the Pentagonâ\\x80\\x99s ability to control technological progress. Now, rather than trickling down from military and advanced corporate laboratories, todayâ\\x80\\x99s new technologies increasingly come from consumer electronics firms. Put simply, the companies that make the fastest computers are the same ones that put things under our Christmas trees. As consumer electronics manufacturing has moved to Asia, both Chinese companies and the nationâ\\x80\\x99s government laboratories are making major investments in artificial intelligence. The advance of the Chinese was underscored last month when Qi Lu, a veteran Microsoft artificial intelligence specialist, left the company  to become chief operating officer at Baidu, where he will oversee the companyâ\\x80\\x99s ambitious plan to become a global leader in A. I. And last year, Tencent, developer of the mobile app WeChat, a Facebook competitor, created an artificial intelligence research laboratory and began investing in United   A. I. companies. Rapid Chinese progress has touched off a debate in the United States between military strategists and technologists over whether the Chinese are merely imitating advances or are engaged in independent innovation that will soon overtake the United States in the field. â\\x80\\x9cThe Chinese leadership is increasingly thinking about how to ensure they are competitive in the next wave of technologies,â\\x80\\x9d said Adam Segal, a specialist in emerging technologies and national security at the Council on Foreign Relations. In August, the   China Daily reported that the country had embarked on the development of a cruise missile system with a â\\x80\\x9chigh levelâ\\x80\\x9d of artificial intelligence. The new system appears to be a response to a missile the United States Navy is expected to deploy in 2018 to counter growing Chinese military influence in the Pacific. Known as the Long Range   Missile, or L. R. A. S. M. it is described as a â\\x80\\x9csemiautonomousâ\\x80\\x9d weapon. According to the Pentagon, this means that though targets are chosen by human soldiers, the missile uses artificial intelligence technology to avoid defenses and make final targeting decisions. The new Chinese weapon typifies a strategy known as â\\x80\\x9cremote warfare,â\\x80\\x9d said John Arquilla, a military strategist at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, Calif. The idea is to build large fleets of small ships that deploy missiles, to attack an enemy with larger ships, like aircraft carriers. â\\x80\\x9cThey are making their machines more creative,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cA little bit of automation gives the machines a tremendous boost. â\\x80\\x9d Whether or not the Chinese will quickly catch the United States in artificial intelligence and robotics technologies is a matter of intense discussion and disagreement in the United States. Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu, said the United States may be too myopic and   to understand the speed of the Chinese competition. â\\x80\\x9cThere are many occasions of something being simultaneously invented in China and elsewhere, or being invented first in China and then later making it overseas,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cBut then U. S. media reports only on the U. S. version. This leads to a misperception of those ideas having been first invented in the U. S. â\\x80\\x9d A key example of Chinese progress that goes largely unreported in the United States is Iflytek, an artificial intelligence company that has focused on speech recognition and understanding natural language. The company has won international competitions both in speech synthesis and in translation between   and   texts. The company, which Chinese technologists said has a close relationship with the government for development of surveillance technology, said it is working with the Ministry of Science and Technology on a â\\x80\\x9cHumanoid Answering Robot. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOur goal is to send the machine to attend the college entrance examination, and to be admitted by key national universities in the near future,â\\x80\\x9d said Qingfeng Liu, Iflytekâ\\x80\\x99s chief executive. The speed of the Chinese technologists, compared to United States and European artificial intelligence developers, is noteworthy. Last April, Gansha Wu, then the director of Intelâ\\x80\\x99s laboratory in China, left his post and began assembling a team of researchers from Intel and Google to build a   car company. Last month, the company, Uisee Technology, met its goal  â\\x80\\x94   taking a demonstration to the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas  â\\x80\\x94   after just nine months of work. â\\x80\\x9cThe A. I. technologies, including machine vision, sensor fusion, planning and control, on our car are completely â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Wu said. â\\x80\\x9cWe wrote every line by ourselves. â\\x80\\x9d Their first vehicle is intended for controlled environments like college and corporate campuses, with the ultimate goal of designing a shared fleet of autonomous taxis. The United Statesâ\\x80\\x99 view of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s advance may be starting to change. Last October, a White House report on artificial intelligence included several footnotes suggesting that China is now publishing more research than scholars here. Still, some scientists say the quantity of academic papers does not tell us much about innovation. And there are indications that China has only recently begun to make A. I. a priority in its military systems. â\\x80\\x9cI think while China is definitely making progress in A. I. systems, it is nowhere close to matching the U. S.,â\\x80\\x9d said Abhijit Singh, a former Indian military officer who is now a naval weapons analyst at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Chinese researchers who are directly involved in artificial intelligence work in China have a very different view. â\\x80\\x9cIt is indisputable that Chinese authors are a significant force in A. I. and their position has been increasing drastically in the past five years,â\\x80\\x9d said   Lee, a   artificial intelligence researcher who played a key role in establishing both Microsoftâ\\x80\\x99s and Googleâ\\x80\\x99s   research laboratories. Mr. Lee, now a venture capitalist who invests in both China and the United States, acknowledged that the United States is still the global leader but believes that the gap has drastically narrowed. His firm, Sinovation Ventures, has recently raised $675 million to invest in A. I. both in the United States and in China. â\\x80\\x9cUsing a chess analogy,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cwe might say that grandmasters are still largely North American, but Chinese occupy increasingly greater portions of the   A. I. scientists. â\\x80\\x9d What is not in dispute is that the close ties between Silicon Valley and China both in terms of investment and research, and the open nature of much of the American A. I. research community, has made the most advanced technology easily available to China. In addition to setting up research outposts such as Baiduâ\\x80\\x99s Silicon Valley A. I. Laboratory, Chinese citizens, including government employees, routinely audit Stanford University artificial intelligence courses. One Stanford professor, Richard Socher, said it was easy to spot the Chinese nationals because after the first few weeks, his students would often skip class, choosing instead to view videos of the lectures. The Chinese auditors, on the other hand, would continue to attend, taking their seats at the front of the classroom. Artificial intelligence is only one part of the tech frontier where China is advancing rapidly. Last year, China also brought the worldâ\\x80\\x99s fastest supercomputer, the Sunway TaihuLight, online, supplanting another Chinese model that had been the worldâ\\x80\\x99s fastest. The new supercomputer is thought to be part of a broader Chinese push to begin driving innovation, a shift from its role as a manufacturing hub for components and devices designed in the United States and elsewhere. In a reflection of the desire to become a center of innovation, the processors in the new computer are of a native Chinese design. The earlier supercomputer, the Tianhe 2, was powered by Intelâ\\x80\\x99s Xeon processors after it came online, the United States banned further export of the chips to China, in hopes of limiting the Chinese push into supercomputing. The new supercomputer, like similar machines anywhere in the world, has a variety of uses, and does not by itself represent a direct military challenge. It can be used to model climate change situations, for instance, or to perform analysis of large data sets. But similar advances in   computing being made by the Chinese could be used to push ahead with   research, which would have military applications, along with more typical defense functions, such as simulating nuclear weapons tests or breaking the encryption used by adversaries. Moreover, while there appear to be relatively cozy relationships between the Chinese government and commercial technology efforts, the same cannot be said about the United States. The Pentagon recently restarted its beachhead in Silicon Valley, known as the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental facility, or DIUx. It is an attempt to rethink bureaucratic United States government contracting practices in terms of the faster and more fluid style of Silicon Valley. The government has not yet undone the damage to its relationship with the Valley brought about by Edward J. Snowdenâ\\x80\\x99s revelations about the National Security Agencyâ\\x80\\x99s surveillance practices. Many Silicon Valley firms remain hesitant to be seen as working too closely with the Pentagon out of fear of losing access to Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s market. â\\x80\\x9cThere are smaller companies, the companies who sort of decided that theyâ\\x80\\x99re going to be in the defense business, like a Palantir,â\\x80\\x9d said Peter W. Singer, an expert in the future of war at New America, a think tank in Washington, referring to the Palo Alto, Calif.   founded in part by the venture capitalist Peter Thiel. â\\x80\\x9cBut if youâ\\x80\\x99re thinking about the big, iconic tech companies, they canâ\\x80\\x99t become defense contractors and still expect to get access to the Chinese market. â\\x80\\x9d Those concerns are real for Silicon Valley. â\\x80\\x9cNo one sort of overtly says that, because the Pentagon canâ\\x80\\x99t say itâ\\x80\\x99s about China, and the tech companies canâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Singer said. â\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s there in the background. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'The Washington Post is of course, befuddled as to what all of this means, so let us break it down for them: FOX News moderators hardly gave Ted Cruz the opportunity to speak, so the viewers who liked what they saw in the brief moments given to Cruz had to do their own research on him (and any of the other non-Trump or non-RINO candidates). I think that about covers it It will be interesting to see what the TV ratings for Thursday night s presidential primary debate look like once they come out.The most Googled candidate in the debate at any point was Ted Cruz   with 67 percent more searches at his peak than the next most-searched candidate s peak.The search volume is all relative to each other; a  100,  the Cruz peak, is the most search in a minute for a candidate.On average, Trump held the most sustained search interest, surprise, surprise. Notice that Ben Carson maintained steady interest, too   followed by Cruz and Marco Rubio.The key point: We have no idea what this means. We don t know if the spike in Cruz searches will convert people to his cause, or the new attention to Carson will boost him in the polls. We don t know. But we do, at least, have some sense of who people wanted to know more about. We ll see if this reveals anything more significant down the road.What the Republican field not named Trump needed to do during the Fox News debate was get people to spread the attention around a bit.

       " 'GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli troops shot dead four Palestinians and wounded 150 others with live fire on Friday, medical officials said, as protests over U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital entered a second week. Most of the casualties were on the Gaza Strip border, where thousands of Palestinians gathered to hurl rocks at Israeli soldiers beyond the fortified fence. Medics said two protesters, one of them wheelchair-bound, were killed and 150 wounded. In the occupied West Bank, another area where Palestinians are seeking statehood along with adjacent East Jerusalem, medics said two protesters were killed and 10 wounded by Israeli gunfire. One of the dead was a man who Israeli police troopers said was shot after he stabbed a member of their unit. Reuters witnesses said the Palestinian held a knife and wore what looked like a bomb belt. A Palestinian medic who helped evacuate the man for treatment said the belt was fake.  Palestinians   and the wider Arab and Muslim world   were incensed at Trump s Dec. 6 announcement, which reversed decades of U.S. policy reticence on Jerusalem, a city where both Israel and the Palestinians want sovereignty.  Washington s European allies and Russia have also voiced worries about Trump s decision. Gaza s dominant Hamas Islamists, which reject coexistence with Israel, called last week for a new Palestinian uprising, but any such mass-mobilisation has yet to be seen in the West Bank or East Jerusalem.      There have been almost nightly Gazan rocket launches into Israel, so far without casualties. Israel has responded with air strikes on Hamas facilities, one of which killed two gunmen. The Israeli military said that, on Friday, about 3,500 Palestinians demonstrated near the Gaza border fence.  During the violent riots IDF (Israel Defence Force) soldiers fired selectively towards main instigators,  the military said in a statement. A military spokeswoman had no immediate comment on the wheelchair-bound protestor, Ibrahim Abu Thuraya. Abu Thuraya, 29, was a regular at such demonstrations. In media interviews, he said he had lost both his legs in a 2008 Israeli missile strike in Gaza. In the West Bank, the Israeli military said that about 2,500 Palestinians took part in riots, rolling flaming tires and throwing fire bombs and rocks at soldiers and border police. Israel captured East Jerusalem, an area laden with Jewish, Muslim and Christian shrines, from Jordan in the 1967 war and later annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. Palestinians hope that part of the city will be the capital of a future independent state and Palestinian leaders say Trump s move is a serious blow to a moribund peace process. Israel has welcomed Trump s announcement as recognizing political reality and biblical Jewish roots in Jerusalem. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to visit Israel, as well as Egypt, next week. ',\n",

       " 'As the presidential race heats up and the coffers start to pour in for a general election, Senate Democrats are preparing to introduce a package of reforms aimed at curbing (once and for all) the influence of big money in politics. This is a liberal s dream come true.Spearheading the reforms is Senator Chuck Schumer of New York   who is poised to become Majority Leader should the Democrats take back the Senate. Closely involved with Schumer are Sens. Tom Udall, Sheldon Whitehouse, Claire McCaskill and Tammy Baldwin.Included in the package is a Constitutional amendment that would overturn Citizens United and other Supreme Court decisions that have allowed dark money to be injected into the political process.The Disclose Act would be included, which would require outside, anonymous groups that spend money on political campaigns to make the identities of their donors public. No more dark money, no more twice removed parties, no more secrets in campaign finance.A new program in the package would replace the watered down, virtually powerless FEC with a five member independent agency that would tasked with enforcing rules an regulations in a fair and open manner.When it comes to fixing America s broken election system, Democrats will include in the package the FAIR Act, which would effectively end partisan gerrymandering by requiring the states to establish independent commissions to draw district lines, and not lawmakers who hold majorities.Senator Claire McCaskill has apparently bee working on a reform to increase voter turnout and participation, which could mean a provision establishing automatic voter registration.According to MSNBC:There are other efforts to address voting rights on Capitol Hill. A group of Democratic lawmakers earlier this week announced the formation of the Voting Rights Caucus, which has 50 members, all Democrats. They said they ll introduce legislation next month that would ban voter ID laws that force voters to pay an associated cost, for instance by requiring them to obtain a birth certificate to get ID.A new constitutional amendment, a new agency to replace the FEC, automatic voter registration and an end to gerrymandering. This is a package every American should support. Considering the overwhelming majority of Americans (including Republicans) support getting money out of politics, oppose dark money contributions, and support fair elections, the GOP has no leverage to oppose any of these measures.But they will. Such a package would surely fail a Republican controlled Senate and House. But this is an election year, and a year where Democrats could make great strides. If Democrats show up at the polls in droves, we could finally have an America free of big money in politics.If Democrats are serious about political revolution, they will need to come together to have a blue White House, Congress, Supreme Court and state legislature.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON  â\\x80\\x94   Days after the Senate confirmed him as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference and was asked about addressing a group that probably wanted to eliminate his agency. â\\x80\\x9cI think itâ\\x80\\x99s justified,â\\x80\\x9d he responded, to cheers. â\\x80\\x9cI think people across the country look at the E. P. A. the way they look at the I. R. S. â\\x80\\x9d In the days since, Mr. Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who built a career out of suing the agency he now leads, has moved to stock the top offices of the agency with   conservatives  â\\x80\\x94   many of them skeptics of climate change and all of them intent on rolling back environmental regulations that they see as overly intrusive and harmful to business. Mr. Pruitt has drawn heavily from the staff of his friend and fellow Oklahoma Republican, Senator James Inhofe, long known as Congressâ\\x80\\x99s most prominent skeptic of climate science. A former Inhofe chief of staff, Ryan Jackson, will be Mr. Pruittâ\\x80\\x99s chief of staff. Another former Inhofe staff member, Byron Brown, will serve as Mr. Jacksonâ\\x80\\x99s deputy. Andrew Wheeler, a fossil fuel lobbyist and a former Inhofe chief of staff, is a finalist to be Mr. Pruittâ\\x80\\x99s deputy, although he requires confirmation to the position by the Senate. To friends and critics, Mr. Pruitt seems intent on building an E. P. A. leadership that is fundamentally at odds with the career officials, scientists and employees who carry out the agencyâ\\x80\\x99s missions. That might be a recipe for strife and gridlock at the federal agency tasked to keep safe the nationâ\\x80\\x99s clean air and water while safeguarding the planetâ\\x80\\x99s future. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s the most different kind of E. P. A. administrator thatâ\\x80\\x99s ever been,â\\x80\\x9d said Steve J. Milloy, a member of the E. P. A. transition team who runs the website JunkScience. com, which aims to debunk climate change. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s not coming in thinking E. P. A. is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Quite the opposite. â\\x80\\x9d Gina McCarthy, who headed the E. P. A. under former President Barack Obama, said she too saw Mr. Pruitt as unique. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s fine to have differing opinions on how to meet the mission of the agency. Many Republican administrators have had that,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cBut here, for the first time, I see someone who has no commitment to the mission of the agency. â\\x80\\x9d A pair of Trump campaigners from Washington State are also heading into senior positions at the E. P. A. Don Benton, a former Washington state senator who headed President Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s state campaign, will be the agencyâ\\x80\\x99s senior liaison with the White House. Douglas Ericksen, a current Washington state senator, is being considered as the regional administrator of the E. P. A. â\\x80\\x99s Pacific Northwest office. As a state senator, Mr. Ericksen has been active in opposing efforts to pass a   climate change law taxing carbon pollution. Last month, he invited Tony Heller, a climate denialist who blogs under the pseudonym Steven Goddard, to address a Washington State Senate committee on the costs of climate change policy. Mr. Hellerâ\\x80\\x99s blog says â\\x80\\x9cglobal warming is the biggest fraud in science history. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI think the reason both of these guys are being considered for this stuff is they were the only prominent elected officials in the state of Washington that were early supporters and organizers for Trump,â\\x80\\x9d said Todd Donovan, a political scientist at Western Washington University. â\\x80\\x9cNo other state legislators were putting their necks out for Trump. â\\x80\\x9d Another transition official under consideration by Mr. Pruitt for a permanent position is David Kreutzer, a senior research fellow in energy economics and climate change at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has publicly praised the benefits of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That view stands in opposition to the broad scientific consensus that increased carbon dioxide traps heat and contributes to the dangerous warming of the planet. The agencyâ\\x80\\x99s policy agenda is snapping into focus: Last week, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to begin the legal process of dismantling a major   regulation aimed at increasing the federal governmentâ\\x80\\x99s authority over rivers, streams and wetlands in order to prevent water pollution. Also last week, Mr. Pruitt ordered the agency to walk back a program on collecting data on methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, from oil and gas wells. This week, Mr. Trump is expected to sign an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to begin the legal process of unwinding Mr. Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s E. P. A. regulations aimed at curbing   pollution from   power plants, and Mr. Pruitt is expected to announce plans to begin to weaken an   rule mandating higher fuel economy standards. A draft White House budget blueprint proposes to slash the E. P. A. budget by about 24 percent, or $2 billion from its current level of $8. 1 billion, and cut employee numbers by about 20 percent from its current staff of about 15, 000. Agency employees say morale has already been damaged. After working for years to draft climate change regulations under the Obama administration, many of those same career scientists and lawyers will be ordered to go back and undo them. Ms. McCarthy, who oversaw the writing and execution of those major water and climate change regulations, said it would be difficult and   to reverse them, especially if Mr. Trump succeeds in greatly downsizing the agency. â\\x80\\x9cIf you want to do these executive orders that require a whole rewrite of the rule, you have to get that right, legally,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cIt took years to do those rules. To now ask for those things to be undone with less staff and low morale  â\\x80\\x94   how are they going to do it?â\\x80\\x9d There is one area in which Mr. Pruitt has vowed to continue the traditional work of the E. P. A.: a longstanding program for sending funds to states to clean up â\\x80\\x9cbrownfieldsâ\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   former industrial sites that have been contaminated by pollution. Although Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s budget blueprint would slash funds for that program, Mr. Pruitt pledged to a gathering of mayors in Washington last week that he would fight to save the program. â\\x80\\x9cWith the White House and Congress I am communicating a message about brownfields,â\\x80\\x9d he told mayors. â\\x80\\x9cI want to hear from you about successes and communicate them. â\\x80\\x9d J. Christian Bollwage, the Democratic mayor of Elizabeth, N. J. a city that has been plagued with industrial pollution, said he was heartened to hear the pledge. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve never heard such a vociferous defense of providing brownfields grants,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cHe was explicit. He said he was going to take the defense of brownfields to the White House. I was impressed and hopeful. â\\x80\\x9d But, Mr. Bollwage added, â\\x80\\x9cComing from New Jersey, climate change is also a big issue. And Iâ\\x80\\x99m still worried about an administration that seems to think climate change is a hoax. â\\x80\\x9d Concern over Mr. Pruittâ\\x80\\x99s stewardship may not be  . There is speculation that the E. P. A. chief already has his eyes on a different office. Mr. Inhofe, 82, will complete his current Senate term in 2020. While he declined to speak of his retirement plans, Mr. Inhofe said of Mr. Pruitt, â\\x80\\x9cI think heâ\\x80\\x99d make a great senator. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'SYDNEY (Reuters) - Several lawmakers filed family history documents in Australia s parliament to meet a government deadline on Tuesday to try to prove their citizenship and stem a crisis that has so far claimed nine MPs and cost the government its majority.     Australia s 116-year-old constitution bans dual citizens from holding national office and the High Court adopted a strict interpretation of it in October in a country where half the population were either born overseas or have a parent who was. The crisis may yet plunge Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull s Liberal-National coalition into minority rule, should it lose another lawmaker, or a crucial by-election set for Dec. 19.      The ruling center-right pairing lost its one-seat lower-house majority when the High Court found Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce to be a New Zealander and therefore ineligible for office. He has since rescinded his New Zealand citizenship and regained his seat in parliament.   But another member has since quit his place and now as many as a dozen more now face referral to the court after the deadline to disclose the birthplace of parents and grandparents passed on Tuesday. The disclosures show that nearly every lawmaker has at least one foreign parent or grandparent. While some provide citizenship records dating back to the 19th century, others give few details or documents, prompting calls for the High Court to consider their cases.      There are a few grey areas, there s no doubt about that,  MP Christopher Pyne said on Perth radio station 6PR, adding that parliament would decide on Thursday which cases to send to the court. One opposition Labor Party member has already told parliament it  remains unclear  whether he is British, after the Home Office could not find the paperwork to prove he renounced his citizenship a decade ago. Labor argues that seven government lawmakers filed  unconvincing  or  incomplete  disclosures, while the government raised doubts over four opposition MPs, and there is a cloud over another independent lawmaker. Although Joyce easily regained his seat at a by-election on Saturday, the crisis still has the government precariously clinging to power and has already dented its ability to pursue its political agenda. If it loses a by-election in Sydney on Dec. 19, or the court ousts another lower-house MP, it would be forced to depend on a handful of independent lawmakers to retain power and pass laws. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday tapped Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai to head the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which is expected to roll back many of the Obama Administrationâ\\x80\\x99s telecommunications and internet policies. Pai, a former Justice Department, FCC and Capitol Hill staffer, in December predicted landmark â\\x80\\x9cnet neutralityâ\\x80\\x9d rules adopted in 2015 would not last. The son of Indian immigrants who grew up in Kansas, Pai said the commission should take a â\\x80\\x9cweed whackerâ\\x80\\x9d to unneeded rules and was harshly critical of many FCC regulations imposed during the Obama administration. â\\x80\\x9cDuring the Trump administration, we will shift from playing defense at the FCC to going on offense,â\\x80\\x9d he said in December. â\\x80\\x9cWe need to fire up the weed whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation, and job creation.â\\x80\\x9d Pai will also have a key role in deciding whether to approve or reject or impose conditions on mergers involving cable and telephone companies. In May, Pai opposed FCC conditions imposed on Charter Communicationâ\\x80\\x99s acquisition of Time Warner Cable. Last week, then FCC chairman Tom Wheeler urged Republicans against dismantling internet access protections that bar service providers from slowing consumer access to web content. Internet providers fear net neutrality rules make it harder to manage internet traffic and make investment in additional capacity less likely. The Republican-controlled Congress is also considering rewriting the net neutrality rules. Pai said in 2015 that consumers would be worse under net neutrality and should â\\x80\\x9cexpect their bills to go up, and they should expect that broadband will be slower going forward.â\\x80\\x9d Senator Maria Cantwell, a Washington state Democrat, criticized Pai in a letter to President Donald Trump Monday as â\\x80\\x9cnot a supporter of the FCCâ\\x80\\x99s strong rules to protect an open internet, putting at risk our robust net neutrality rules and the three million internet economy jobs it supports.â\\x80\\x9d Under Wheeler, the FCC and major telecom and cable companies have been at odds over a number of big issues in recent years, including tougher broadband privacy rules and a proposal to allow pay-TV consumers to ditch set top boxes. Comcast Corp, AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, Frontier Communications Corp, T-Mobile US Inc and Charter all praised Paiâ\\x80\\x99s appointment in separate statements. â\\x80\\x9cChairman Pai will work with his fellow commissioners to quickly and decisively put back in place the commonsense regulatory framework necessary to support the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s agenda,â\\x80\\x9d AT&T said. However, advocacy group Free Press President Craig Aaron said Pai â\\x80\\x9chas been on the wrong side of just about every major issue that has come before the FCC during his tenure. Heâ\\x80\\x99s never met a mega-merger he didnâ\\x80\\x99t like or a public safeguard he didnâ\\x80\\x99t try to undermine.â\\x80\\x9d U.S. Telecom, an industry trade group, said in a statement it shares Paiâ\\x80\\x99s vision for a â\\x80\\x9cfuture based on a bold but pragmatic strategy to erase the many regulatory barriers impeding the expansion of our nationâ\\x80\\x99s communications infrastructure, and the jobs and economic opportunity that depend on it.â\\x80\\x9d Pai does not need Senate confirmation as chairman but his current term expires at year end and he will need to be reconfirmed to continue.

       " 'US Congressman Joe Wilson was right! Obama is a liar His reckless and amateur decisions have made America more unsafe than we have ever been. Now he s asking Americans to vote for Hillary to ensure his lawless legacy lives on The Obama administration secretly organized an airlift of $400 million worth of cash to Iran that coincided with the January release of four Americans detained in Tehran, according to U.S. and European officials and congressional staff briefed on the operation afterward.Wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs and other currencies were flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, according to these officials. The U.S. procured the money from the central banks of the Netherlands and Switzerland, they said.The money represented the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a decades-old dispute over a failed arms deal signed just before the 1979 fall of Iran s last monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.The settlement, which resolved claims before an international tribunal in The Hague, also coincided with the formal implementation that same weekend of the landmark nuclear agreement reached between Tehran, the U.S. and other global powers the summer before. With the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well,  President Barack Obama said at the White House on Jan. 17 without disclosing the $400 million cash payment.Senior U.S. officials denied any link between the payment and the prisoner exchange. They say the way the various strands came together simultaneously was coincidental, not the result of any quid pro quo. As we ve made clear, the negotiations over the settlement of an outstanding claim were completely separate from the discussions about returning our American citizens home,  State Department spokesman John Kirby said.  Not only were the two negotiations separate, they were conducted by different teams on each side, including, in the case of The Hague claims, by technical experts involved in these negotiations for many years. But U.S. officials also acknowledge that Iranian negotiators on the prisoner exchange said they wanted the cash to show they had gained something tangible.Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas and a fierce foe of the Iran nuclear deal, accused President Barack Obama of paying  a $1.7 billion ransom to the ayatollahs for U.S. hostages. This break with longstanding U.S. policy put a price on the head of Americans, and has led Iran to continue its illegal seizures  of Americans, he said.Since the cash shipment, the intelligence arm of the Revolutionary Guard has arrested two more Iranian-Americans. Tehran has also detained dual-nationals from France, Canada and the U.K. in recent months.At the time of the prisoner release, Secretary of State John Kerry and the White House portrayed it as a diplomatic breakthrough. Mr. Kerry cited the importance of  the relationships forged and the diplomatic channels unlocked over the course of the nuclear talks. For entire story: Wall Street JournalAs a bonus, here is Rep.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump dictated a statement, later shown to be misleading, in which his son Donald Trump Jr. said a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 was not related to his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s presidential campaign, the Washington Post reported on Monday. Trump Jr. released emails earlier in July that showed he eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as part of Moscowâ\\x80\\x99s official support for his father. The New York Times was first to report the meeting. The Washington Post said Trump advisers discussed the new disclosure and agreed that Trump Jr. should issue a truthful account of the episode so that it â\\x80\\x9ccouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be repudiated later if the full details emerged.â\\x80\\x9d The president, who was flying home from Germany on July 8, changed the plan and â\\x80\\x9cpersonally dictated a statement in which Trump Jr. said he and the Russian lawyer had â\\x80\\x98primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d the Post said, citing unnamed people with knowledge of the deliberations. It said the statement, issued to the New York Times as it prepared to publish the story, emphasized that the subject of the meeting was â\\x80\\x9cnot a campaign issue at the time.â\\x80\\x9d An attorney for Trump, Jay Sekulow, issued a statement in response to the Post report: â\\x80\\x9cApart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent.â\\x80\\x9d  The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the Post story, nor did Trump Jr.â\\x80\\x99s attorney, Alan Futerfas. U.S. investigators are probing whether there was collusion between the Kremlin and Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Republican presidential campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow sought to hurt Clinton and help Trump in the 2016 election. Russia denies any interference, and Trump has denied collusion with Russia.The president applauded his sonâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9ctransparencyâ\\x80\\x9d after he released the email exchanges on July 11. â\\x80\\x9cIt remains unclear exactly how much the president knew at the time of the flight about Trump Jr.â\\x80\\x99s meeting,â\\x80\\x9d the Washington Post said. David Sklansky, a professor of criminal law at Stanford Law School, said that if Trump, as reported by the Post, helped craft a misleading public statement about the meeting, he may have bolstered a potential obstruction of justice case against himself.  To build a criminal obstruction of justice case, federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with â\\x80\\x9ccorruptâ\\x80\\x9d intent.

       " 'A new, confidential federal report shows that the initial segment of Californiaâ\\x80\\x99s partially   high speed rail (HSR) project will come in massively over budget and far behind schedule, the Los Angeles Times reports. [The Times obtained the  Federal Railroad Administration risk analysis report, which shows projected costs for just the first   Central Valley section of the â\\x80\\x9cbullet trainâ\\x80\\x9d will soar to 150 percent  â\\x80\\x94   $3. 6 billion more, over a previous estimate. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the â\\x80\\x9cbridges, viaducts, trenches and track from Merced to Shafterâ\\x80\\x9d that could now cost between $9. 5 and $10 billion dollars. This section of the project wonâ\\x80\\x99t even yet serve the promised dream of a San Francisco to Los Angeles line.  Not only are costs projected to soar, but the segment that was supposed to be complete this year has been projected in the federal report to lag seven years behind schedule with a new projected completion set for 2024. The Federal Railroad Administration provided California with $3. 5 billion between two federal grants for the project. President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s 2009 stimulus granted funds to the project however, if the state fails to meet a September 30 deadline that requires paperwork to be submitted by June 20, the rail authority could lose up to $220 million of those funds. The federal report that the Times exposed included a host of reasons for the delays, among them, â\\x80\\x9c  management problems: significant delays in environmental planning, lags in processing invoices for federal grants and continuing failures to acquire needed property. â\\x80\\x9d The federal report further found that billing invoices took an unacceptable three months to process, and that environmental reviews have been far too slow and getting worse. The rail authority has pushed back on many of the report findings according to the Times report. Rep. Jeff Denham, who serves as Chairman of the House Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee, released the following statement regarding the new report: Despite past issues with funding this boondoggle, we were repeatedly assured in an August field hearing that construction costs were under control. They continue to reaffirm my belief that this is a huge waste of taxpayer dollars. I will continue to fight against any further federal funding of this project. They can expect an audit and oversight hearing in the near future.   House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( ) also released a statement: This report makes one thing clear: California   rail must be stopped immediately. There have been repeated concerns that this project was a designed failure since day one, and whatâ\\x80\\x99s worse, this report underscores a pattern of falsehoods that has misled taxpayers on what this project might actually cost and how much more taxpayers might be on the hook for. The California   Rail Authority was briefed about this estimate in December, yet decided to keep this report under wraps from California taxpayers and the public. My colleagues and I have been   from the start. The train was sold on rosy predictions not grounded in reality, has disrupted the lives and communities of Californians, and remains a   publicity project that we cannot afford. This needs to end now. I urge Governor Brown and his Administration to recognize that the only solution left is to pull the plug on this boondoggle.

       " 'Nothing says Hollywood like supporting a serial liar who s managed to keep herself in the spotlight by clinging to the coattails of her husband, fellow grifter, serial philanderer and former President, Bill Clinton According to the Los Angeles Times, Hollywood donors have given $5.5 million to candidates on both sides of the 2016 presidential race. Of those donations, 90 percent have gone to Hillary Clinton s campaign.Hillary Clinton and die hard progressive  singer  Katy Perry While talk of Vice President Joe Biden jumping into the race had swept Hollywood in recent months, with donors previously announcing they would be ready to back him financially, Biden announced this week he would not run for a third time.That leaves the door open for Clinton to consolidate the industry s financial backing, which she largely has accomplished.Aside from a number of artists and other entertainment figures standing behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)16% , Clinton has not only garnered support from most democrats, but has received about $5 million of the total $5.5 million given by Hollywood this cycle.Danny DeVito, who gave $2,700, and Jackson Browne, who pledged $1,350, are supporting Sanders. Others, such as Sarah Silverman, Will Ferrell, and Red Hot Chili Peppers singer Anthony Kiedis, are also supporting Sanders.Meanwhile, Clinton has collected maximum personal donations from Kanye West, Usher, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Bryan Cranston, Tom Hanks, and Barbra Streisand.Clinton has also received $2,700 apiece from Dana Walden, head of Fox Television Group; Patrick Wachsberger, co-chair of Lionsgate Motion Picture Group; and HBO s president of programming, Michael Lombardo, according to the LA Times.On the GOP side, Jeb Bush has received $5,400 from CBS sports commentator Jim Nantz and $2,700 from producer Jerry Bruckheimer.Bush leads the Republican Party with roughly $165,000 in donations from Hollywood, while New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie comes in second with almost $90,000. Via: Breitbart News',\n",
       " 'Poor and   Americans have fallen behind over the last generation, receiving few of the gains of an expanding economy. But we could change that by using one of the most powerful tools in the federal governmentâ\\x80\\x99s policy arsenal.   Donald J. Trump says he will do this by using large tax cuts on business and to wealthy families to encourage more business investment, while aiming to create more   jobs in construction and manufacturing by spending more on new infrastructure projects and renegotiating trade deals. But another, more direct approach is possible, one aimed at turbocharging the wages of people who have lost out on the economic gains of the last few decades. That could be done by expanding a tax credit that is already in place and enjoys bipartisan support. With the help of some smart policy wonks in Washington, I examined using tax policy this way. We found that it could work, but at no small cost. On the positive side: You could replace every dime of income that the bottom 20 percent of earners have lost compared with the average family since 1979 by radically expanding a tax credit. But the main problem is this: It would be really expensive, at more than $1 trillion over the next decade, and therefore a hard sell in any political environment. The lessons from this project have more relevance for the Trump administration  â\\x80\\x94   which isnâ\\x80\\x99t likely to embrace this kind of technocratic wonkery  â\\x80\\x94   than it might seem at first glance. Consider that Mr. Trump is betting on lower taxes on businesses and the investor class unleashing faster economic growth and preventing the budget deficit from skyrocketing. But he may want to consider hedging his bets. Policies that funnel direct benefits to   workers might complement his   approach. Put another way, as long as youâ\\x80\\x99re cutting taxes by $6 trillion (that is the   direct cost estimate of Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s plan from the Tax Foundation) carving out $1 trillion for workers who havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen large raises in years may just pay some dividends. The background is that economic growth has far outpaced income growth for decades. Gross domestic product for each person in the United States was 78 percent higher in 2015 than in 1979. But the average income for those households at the 20th percentile of the income distribution rose only 6. 9 percent in that span. The reasons for this gap are endlessly debatable. Here are a few: The modern economy offers higher rewards for those with advanced education globalization has diminished the prospects of the industries where   Americans once found lucrative jobs a decline in the power of labor unions has left workers with less negotiating leverage. Whatever the true cause, it is clear that the tax code could fix at least some of the imbalance. And there is already a program on the books that supplements the   earnings of   Americans. It is the   tax credit, often simply called the E. I. T. C. and it could be used much more aggressively. The   tax credit already supplements the wages of people at the lower end of the pay scale, especially those with children. In its current form, for example, a married couple with two children that makes $30, 000 a year receives a tax credit of $4, 201. The   tax credit is accepted across the political spectrum: Both President Obama and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, favor expanding it. It rewards only those who work, is efficiently administered through the tax code and phases out automatically as a personâ\\x80\\x99s income rises. How much more money in tax credits would be required to replace the income shortfall left by poorer people in recent decades? Experts at two Washington think tanks  â\\x80\\x94   Bob Greenstein, Chuck Marr and   Huang of the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, along with the staff of the Tax Policy Center  â\\x80\\x94   examined that question at my request. The first step was to design a tax credit expansion that would raise the income of the bottom 20 percent of families to where they would be if they shared equally in the gains since 1979. That meant figuring out a tax change that would put an extra $2, 889 in the pockets of a family of three that in 2013 made $20, 420. An increase in benefits also helps families with somewhat higher incomes. For example, a family of four making $40, 000 would receive about $6, 000 a year in this expanded E. I. T. C. compared with the $2, 142 they get now. The benefits wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t completely phase out for a family of four until they hit nearly $70, 000 of income. So what would it all cost? The Tax Policy Center crunched the numbers: The policy would deplete federal coffers by $1. 02 trillion over a decade. That is serious money. There are many ways of raising it, none of them easy. If you wanted to soak the wealthy to pay for it, for example, you could enact a 5. 6 percentage point surtax on families with income over $1 million, as Senate Democrats once proposed  â\\x80\\x94   yet that would cover only about 45 percent of the cost. If you favor a more   approach, you could give companies tax incentives to repatriate money they are stashing abroad. But that would get you only about 30 percent of the way there. So even if you conclude that a radical expansion of tax credits for   Americans is desirable, the politics of paying for it are somewhere between very hard and impossible. But that is where the Trump presidency comes in. Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign tax plan  already implies a far greater reduction in federal revenue than this idea does. He may be betting that lower taxes on businesses and the wealthy will spur investment that increases the productive potential of the economy  â\\x80\\x94   a classic   â\\x80\\x9csupply sideâ\\x80\\x9d approach to taxes. But skeptics may argue that what ails the economy right now is inadequate demand for goods and services, and that   people donâ\\x80\\x99t have enough money. If they had extra cash in their pockets from an expanded E. I. T. C. they would be more likely than millionaires to spend the money, many economic studies suggest. That means that including help for the working class in any tax overhaul would add a â\\x80\\x9cdemand sideâ\\x80\\x9d source of economic growth. That wonâ\\x80\\x99t solve the problems of   Americans. The dissatisfaction with the modern global economy that helped propel Mr. Trump to office is deep rooted. It involves a feeling of lost possibility that a bit of money alone wonâ\\x80\\x99t solve. That is especially true for people who once saw manufacturing jobs as both a pathway to a   income and a sense of purpose in life. But while technocratic solutions involving tweaking the tax code wonâ\\x80\\x99t relieve the angst of Trump voters, if there are going to be big tax cuts in the months ahead, there is an economic rationale for spreading the benefits beyond the top.',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump is another step closer to suffering a major policy defeat, and that s good news for the Affordable Care Act.Trump and House Republicans have been pushing for passage of a bill they dubiously refer to as the  American Healthcare Act,  depsite the fact that s it not American nor is it healthcare.Indeed, the legislation is designed to kill the Affordable Care Act, which slowed the rising costs of health insurance premiums and extended healthcare coverage to tens of millions of Americans.If Republicans pass Trumpcare, millions of Americans will lose their coverage and the price of healthcare will skyrocket, especially among senior citizens.The Republican bill is a bad one, but Trump, who thinks it s  wonderful,  went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to beg Republicans to pass it and threatened to punish any Republicans who vote against it.Several Republicans who attended the meeting told the Washington Post that Trump literally promised to  come after  them. I m gonna come after you, but I know I won t have to, because I know you ll vote  yes,  Trump said.  Honestly, a loss is not acceptable, folks. But apparently, Trump s threats spectacularly backfired and his self-manufactured reputation as a  dealmaker  took a humiliating hit.Prior to the meeting, NBC had counted 17 Republicans who were leaning against the bill. After the meeting NBC counted 27, which means ten Republicans turned against Trump and his pathetic health care bill in a matter of hours.Republicans are hoping to bring the bill up for a vote on the House floor on Thursday, but it won t pass if GOP leadership can t keep the number of Republicans leaning against it under 22.This would be a humiliating defeat for Trump, especially after he has repeatedly hyped the bill on social media.On Wednesday morning, Trump bragged about the bill on Twitter again.Big day for healthcare. Working hard!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2017It s a big day alright.

Seddique Mateen said: We were in Downtown Miami, Bayside, people were playing music, and he saw two men kissing each other in front of his wife and kid and he got very angry. They were kissing each other and touching each other and he said,  Look at that. In front of my son they are doing that.  And they we were in the men s bathroom and men were kissing each other. For the media, and every other political leader in the US, this was now classified as a  hate crime , and so  case closed.

       " 'NEW DELHI  â\\x80\\x94   At least 36 passengers were killed in a train derailment in southern India on Saturday night, the latest disaster on Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s old and overburdened railway system. Government and medical authorities said that at least 40 additional passengers were injured, several critically, and admitted to hospitals. Rescue workers struggled into the early morning to pull the injured passengers and dead bodies from the engine and nine coaches, the authorities said. The accident took place in the Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh state in southern India, when the engine and coaches of the Hirakhand Express from Jagdalpur to Bhubaneshwar derailed at 11:15 p. m. according to a statement issued by Indian Railways, the   firm that runs Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s trains. The authorities said the cause was not clear, and Indian Railways announced an investigation. Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s railways, which transport 23 million people a day over more than 70, 000 miles of track, have been neglected for years. In 2014, there were more than 27, 000   deaths in India. In 2012, a committee appointed to review the safety of the rail network cited â\\x80\\x9ca grim picture of inadequate performance largely due to poor infrastructure and resources. â\\x80\\x9d It recommended many urgent measures, including upgrading tracks, repairing bridges, eliminating level crossings and replacing old coaches with safer ones that would better protect passengers in case of an accident. These remedies came with a hefty price tag: The committee said it would cost some $14 billion over five years to put the railways on safer footing. Still, it advised that the work should proceed â\\x80\\x9cin a   manner with required resources mobilized. â\\x80\\x9d This was never done. Enku Swamy, the district fire officer for Vizianagaram, said in a telephone interview that rescue agencies took about 40 minutes to reach the accident site, in a remote area close to the border of Odisha state. â\\x80\\x9cSome people died because of a stampede inside the derailed coaches,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Swamy said. Madan Mohal Nial, 21, a passenger, said in an interview from his hospital bed that he was making the journey to take an exam for a government job when the derailment happened. â\\x80\\x9cWe heard a loud noise suddenly, and the train coaches turned upside down,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cMany passengers fell down on me. My left hand got trapped in the window rods and got injured. â\\x80\\x9d Despite the injury to his arm, he searched the coach twice for his luggage because it contained his educational certificates, he said. He said he was not able to find his luggage and finally had to leave to be hospitalized.   injured passengers were admitted to the nearby Government Area Hospital in Parvatipuram. â\\x80\\x9cMost of the injured suffered abdominal and chest crush injuries, and multiple bone fractures on upper and lower limbs,â\\x80\\x9d Dr. G. Nagabhusana Rao, medical superintendent of the hospital, said in a telephone interview. Indian Railways announced compensation of 200, 000 rupees, about $2, 937, to the families of the dead, and 50, 000 rupees, or about $734, to injured passengers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his grief on Twitter, calling the accident a tragedy. Passenger safety, or the lack of it, has come under scrutiny in India in recent months. In November, more than 140 passengers died in the derailment of passenger coaches near the city of Kanpur. In the weeks after that accident, two more people died in another derailment of passenger coaches in the same stretch of track.',\n",

China has experienced housing booms and busts before. And fervor for real estate among the wealthiest Chinese has already spread far beyond the countryâ\\x80\\x99s borders, from Long Island mansions to disused ranches in Texas  â\\x80\\x94   many to get their money out of the country. But economists warn that the current boom on the Chinese mainland could be extra difficult to resolve: It comes with a growing amount of   debt.   household loans  â\\x80\\x94   mostly mortgages  â\\x80\\x94   have doubled as a share of total official bank lending this year. They accounted for about 40 percent of all new loans in August, contrasted with just 20 percent at the start of the year. The value of new home loans as a percentage of all housing sales has surged to a record high. The loans  â\\x80\\x94   largely a byproduct of a flood of Chinese lending to keep the economy growing  â\\x80\\x94   are helping the affluent, the middle class and low earners who have dreamed of owning a home, while investors and speculators are piling in, too. Underground lenders  â\\x80\\x94   those who operate outside the formal banking system using a variety of new platforms  â\\x80\\x94   are also helping to feed the boom. Last month, economists at the Bank of China warned in a report that worsening asset price bubbles were adding to a frothy market that could result in trouble. The day before, Wang Jianlin, a politically connected property and entertainment magnate who is one of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s richest people, told CNN that China property was â\\x80\\x9cthe biggest bubble in history. â\\x80\\x9d That could be bad news for the global economy. Many economists estimate that housing and related areas  â\\x80\\x94   like construction, cement manufacturing or furniture making  â\\x80\\x94   account for roughly   of Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s economic activity. But if the bubble pops, that support could disappear quickly. Chinese officials, apparently mindful of the 2008 American housing bust, appear to be aware of the risks of a   property bubble. But some economists worry they will be too slow to rein it in. â\\x80\\x9cThe risk is that the government is late in cooling the market, the rally spreads to more areas, pushing up household leverage and construction activity, pushing the bubble bigger, which is then followed by a bigger downward correction,â\\x80\\x9d said Tao Wang, the head of China economics at UBS in Hong Kong. Local regulators are already trying to cool things down. In the last few weeks, local authorities have accelerated efforts to tighten housing markets in up to 20 Chinese cities, according to economists at China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank. But in many cases these steps have only added to the rush, as home buyers move in while they can. By her account, Zhang Xia and her husband have enjoyed a happy marriage. Then the rumor swept the city that Shanghai authorities would make it harder for couples with one home to buy more. On a recent Monday, Ms. Zhang, a    resident of Shanghaiâ\\x80\\x99s Huangpu area, and her husband sat waiting at a local marriage registry office to file for divorce. Shanghai officials continue to deny that they will limit house buying by couples, but Ms. Zhang is among many who do not believe them. â\\x80\\x9cWe know the government said this is a rumor, but they also said that a few times before, when the rumor actually came true,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Zhang said. â\\x80\\x9cSome people even said the fact that the government said itâ\\x80\\x99s a rumor means itâ\\x80\\x99s going to be true. â\\x80\\x9d Shanghai, Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s financial capital, is at the heart of the property boom. Demand there is so intense that developers now commonly require sizable deposits of cash just to join a lottery to buy a new apartment. Only holders of winning numbers will be offered the chance to buy a unit. One flashy new development in central Shanghai charges a refundable 200, 000 renminbi, or $30, 000, to enter its lottery. â\\x80\\x9cIn Shanghai now,â\\x80\\x9d said Wang Jie, a sales manager there, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s not like you can buy an apartment just because you have money. â\\x80\\x9d Back on Lufeng Road, the recently widowed Ms. Zheng and her neighbors try to go about their lives despite the boom going on around them. Men and women play   near a   house, one of a number of dwellings along the road in various states of disassembly, like a row of rotting teeth. Stray dogs sunbathe and alley cats hunt around piles of red bricks and wooden beams scattered on the street. In recent months, local officials hung red propaganda banners on peopleâ\\x80\\x99s housing extolling the benefits of selling out. â\\x80\\x9cNo more hesitation means no more disappointment,â\\x80\\x9d reads one. Says another: â\\x80\\x9cRequisition and compensation are lawful. Smart alecks will regret it later. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cLook at those banners,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Zheng said, shaking her head. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s almost like the Cultural Revolution once again. â\\x80\\x9d Earlier, local officials told Ms. Zheng that the land where her home stands would be used to build supporting facilities for the   complex of   built by China Vanke, the countryâ\\x80\\x99s largest property developer. â\\x80\\x9cThey said that when people who live in the   in Vanke look down, the view from their windows is our ugly roofs,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cSo they have to get rid of us. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       " 'The Militarized Police at Standing Rock is Working for This Man The months long Dakota Access Keystone XL pipleine protest at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation ... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/10/the-militarized-police-at-standing-rock.html The months long Dakota Access Keystone XL pipleine protest at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation by Native Americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply has been met with heavy-handed and brutal clamp down by police and national guard. Militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with LRAD sonic weapons, attack dogs , tear gas, tazers , and even live ammunition ( killing horses ), while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity, hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up. But, as the saying goes, Water Is Life , and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement, therefore, for people concerned with life, giving up on this is simply unthinkable. The root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism, and the perception that money is more important than life itself.When the police and national guard attack U.S. citizens on private property to protect corporate interests, who are they really working for? The corporate dream of the Keystone XL pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way. At the top of this pyramid of profit is Texas billionaire Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for the project. So who is Kelcy Warren? A native of East Texas and graduate of the University of Texas at Arlington with a degree in civil engineering, Warren worked in the natural gas industry and became co-chair of Energy Transfer Equity in 2007. With business partner Ray Davis, co-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, Warren built Energy Transfer Equity into one of the nationâ\\x80\\x99s largest pipeline companies, which now owns about 71,000 miles of pipelines carrying natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products and crude oil. The companyâ\\x80\\x99s holdings include Sunoco, Southern Union and Regency Energy Partners. Forbes estimates the 60-year-old Warrenâ\\x80\\x99s personal wealth at $4 billion. Bloomberg described him as â\\x80\\x9camong Americaâ\\x80\\x99s new shale tycoonsâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94 but rather than building a fortune by drilling he â\\x80\\x9ctakes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another, chilling, boiling, pressurizing, and processing it until itâ\\x80\\x99s worth more than when it burst from the wellhead.â\\x80\\x9d [ Ref. ] Shockingly, in 2015 the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, appointed Warren to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect Big Bend National Park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another $770 million pipeline project .â\\x80\\x9cAccording to the governorâ\\x80\\x99s office, the state parks and wildlife commission â\\x80\\x9cmanages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of Texas,â\\x80\\x9d along with ensuring the future of hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for Texans.â\\x80\\x9d [ Ref. ] This glaring conflict of interest has inspired Environmental Science major at UTSA and former Texas State Park Ambassador Andrew Lucas to begin a drive to have Warren removed from this environmental post. His petition is described here : Most people may know Kelcy Warren as the man behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. The Dallas-based billionaire and CEO of Energy Transfer Partners has been making headlines for fast-tracking a 1100 mile crude oil pipeline across the Midwest and under the Missouri River, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. No environmental impact assessment, no respect for cultural sites, and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river. A similar story is unfolding out in West Texas, where Warrenâ\\x80\\x99s company has split through the pristine Big Bend region with the 200 mile Comanche Trail Pipeline and nearly-complete 143 mile Trans Pecos Pipeline. These Pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the Trans Pecos region. With untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of Energy Transfer Partners, it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago, Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed Kelcy Warren for a 6 year term as 1 of the 10 commissioners who preside over Texas Parks And Wildlifeâ\\x80¦ Why? Probably the $550,000 in campaign contributions Abbott received from Warren.

He is the head of the Dakota Access Pipeline snake. If you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating, gassing and attacking peaceful resistors, including women, children and the elderly, the answer is, they are doing it to protect the interests of Kelcy Warren and others invested in this pipeline project.

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Cityâ\\x80\\x99s fiscal watchdog said the city faces much bigger budget deficits in coming years than the mayor has forecast and warned state lawmakers about treating the city like a â\\x80\\x9cpiggy bank.â\\x80\\x9d The state, like the city, is finalizing its budget and will soon make decisions affecting New York City. â\\x80\\x9cSome upstate legislators just donâ\\x80\\x99t get it,â\\x80\\x9d New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said during his review of the city budget on Wednesday. â\\x80\\x9cThey see New York City as their piggy bank.â\\x80\\x9d  Stringer cautioned against last-minute, late-night budget decisions that could deprive the city of resources. His comments reflected growing frustration with state lawmakers over their suggestions that the city is flush with cash after a stronger economic recovery than other parts of the state. New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo has had a tense relationship with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, persuading his fellow Democrat last year to pay $2.5 billion toward the cityâ\\x80\\x99s public transportation system, which is run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency. There have also been suggestions in the state capital that the city could do more to fund healthcare costs and pay more for the cityâ\\x80\\x99s university system. New York State legislators are known for â\\x80\\x9cvampireâ\\x80\\x9d budget sessions that go into the early hours to beat the budget deadline at the start of the stateâ\\x80\\x99s fiscal year on April 1. Stringer said that although next yearâ\\x80\\x99s budget remained balanced, the total gaps forecast through fiscal year 2020 are $1 billion more than the mayorâ\\x80\\x99s office had predicted. â\\x80\\x9cBudget monitors and rating agencies have all applauded this administrationâ\\x80\\x99s fiscal prudence and focus on protecting against economic uncertainty â\\x80\\x93 and investors agree,â\\x80\\x9d said Amy Spitalnick, a spokesperson for de Blasio.  The mayorâ\\x80\\x99s office points out that Stringer projects $900 million in additional tax revenue for this financial year and next, and cites that as an example of cautious revenue projections on the cityâ\\x80\\x99s part. Stringer said the mayor should not have included $731 million from the sale of taxi medallions through 2020, saying the taxi business is currently in upheaval. The city has already cut it expectations for revenue from taxi medallion sales but Stringer has been more aggressive in elimintaing it from later years. He also said some taxes would be lower than the mayor is predicting and that costs for overtime, healthcare and homeless shelters would be higher. ',\n",

       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s government has not yet decided what it wants from a final Brexit deal because it is still waiting to clear preliminary talks with Brussels, finance minister Philip Hammond said on Wednesday. With the clock ticking towards Britain s scheduled March 2019 exit from the European union, the government is focused at the moment on getting a green light for the negotiations on future trade relations with the EU, Hammond said.  The cabinet has had general discussions about our Brexit negotiations but we haven t had a specific mandating of an end-state position,  he told lawmakers in Britain s parliament. Prime Minister Theresa May s top ministers have big differences over what Brexit should mean for Britain, and over the extent of concessions that the country should offer in return for preferential access to the EU s single market. Hammond said a group of key government ministers would deal with the issue once Britain is given the go-ahead by other EU countries that it can proceed with negotiations for a new, post-Brexit trade deal. That go-ahead is on hold pending an agreement by the bloc s other 27 member states that Britain has done enough on the terms of its divorce, now stuck on differences over how open the future border between Ireland and Northern Ireland should be.  We are not yet at that stage and it would have been premature to  have that discussion until we reach that stage,  Hammond told parliament s Treasury Committee. A spokesman for May, asked about Hammond s comments, told reporters that government ministers would discuss the preferred outcome of the Brexit talks before the end of the year.  We re not into phase two (of negotiations) yet, and Brussels have been clear that they re not prepared to discuss  end state ,  the spokesman said. Earlier on Wednesday Brexit minister David Davis inflamed critics of the government s handling of Brexit when he said he had not conducted formal sector-by-sector analyses of the effect of Brexit on the economy, arguing they were not yet necessary. Hammond has previously said he favors striking a  pragmatic  deal with the EU to minimize Brexit s impact on businesses and the economy, angering some Brexit supporters who favor a more definitive rupture with Brussels. On Wednesday, Hammond reiterated that Britain would leave the EU s single market and its customs union but that need not represent a big change to Britain s relationship with the bloc, if Britain replicates most of the current arrangements.  Now, that would have consequences and some of our colleagues would not find that palatable, but it would be logically possible to approach it in that way,  he said. May hopes to secure the launch of the second phase of the Brexit negotiations when she meets other EU leaders next week. But she suffered a setback this week when her allies in a political party from Northern Ireland objected to proposals for post-Brexit rules for the border with Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party said on Wednesday the stand-off increased the likelihood of a  no deal  Brexit - the nightmare scenario for many British businesses. ',\n",

       " 'HAMPTON, Va.  â\\x80\\x94   Growing up here in the 1970s, in the shadow of Langley Research Center, where workers helped revolutionize air flight and put Americans on the moon, Margot Lee Shetterly had a pretty fixed idea of what scientists looked like: They were middle class,   and worked at NASA, like her dad. It would be years before she learned that this was far from the American norm. And that many women in her hometown defied convention, too, by having vibrant, and by most standards, unusual careers. Black and female, dozens had worked at the space agency as mathematicians, often under Jim Crow laws, calculating crucial trajectories for rockets while being segregated from their white counterparts. For decades, as the space race made heroes out of   astronauts, the stories of those women went largely untold. Four of them are the subjects of Ms. Shetterlyâ\\x80\\x99s first book, â\\x80\\x9cHidden Figures,â\\x80\\x9d a history being released on Tuesday by William Morrow. The book garnered an early burst of attention because its movie version, starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle MonÃ¡e, is scheduled for a   release and set for an Oscars run. The movie rights were snapped up weeks after Ms. Shetterly sold her book proposal in 2014, and well before she started writing the book in earnest, a disorientingly fast, if exhilarating, turn. â\\x80\\x9cThe thrilling thing to me about the book, and the movie, is this is an American story that weâ\\x80\\x99re getting to see through the faces of these women,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Shetterly said during a recent visit to Hampton, which sits on the southeastern end of the Virginia Peninsula, surrounded by aquamarine waters and Navy ships. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s just as American a story as if it were John Glenn or Alan Shepard telling it. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Shetterly happened upon the idea for the book six years ago, when she and her husband, Aran Shetterly, then living in Mexico, were visiting her parents here. The couple and Ms. Shetterlyâ\\x80\\x99s father were driving around in his minivan when he mentioned, very casually, that one of Ms. Shetterlyâ\\x80\\x99s former Sunday school teachers had worked as a mathematician at NASA, and that another woman she knew calculated rocket trajectories for famous astronauts. Ms. Shetterly remembers her husband perking up and asking why he had never heard this tale before. â\\x80\\x9cI knew women who worked at NASA as mathematicians and engineers,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Shetterly said, â\\x80\\x9cbut it took someone from the outside saying, â\\x80\\x98Wait a minuteâ\\x80\\x99 for me to see the story there. â\\x80\\x9d (A book on a similar topic, Nathalia Holtâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cRise of the Rocket Girls,â\\x80\\x9d about women working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the â\\x80\\x9940s and â\\x80\\x9950s, was published in April.) Two of the women she would focus on are still living in the area. Christine Darden, now 73 and retired, had worked her way out of NASAâ\\x80\\x99s computing pool to lead engineering research into sonic booms. Katherine Johnson, who recently turned 98, lives in a retirement home with her husband of 57 years, James A. Johnson, and is enjoying a recent surge of fame. She calculated rocket trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo missions, and last year President Obama personally awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her lifeâ\\x80\\x99s work. Mrs. Darden and Mrs. Johnson still socialize, and on a recent summer day, made meltingly hot by a heat wave, met to play bridge at Mrs. Johnsonâ\\x80\\x99s apartment. (Mrs. Johnson and her partner won.) Ms. Shetterly was visiting too, and presented both women with an early copy of her book. â\\x80\\x9cFantastic,â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Darden said, as Mrs. Johnson, whose eyesight is failing, peered at the cover with a slight smile. Yet asked how she felt about the coming film, in which she is played by Ms. Henson, in the starring role, Mrs. Johnson became solemn. (Mrs. Darden is not portrayed onscreen, as the film focuses on the years preceding her arrival at NASA.) â\\x80\\x9cI shudder,â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Johnson said. She had heard, she said, that the movie might stretch the facts, and that her character possibly came across as aggressive. â\\x80\\x9cI was never aggressive,â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Johnson said. Ms. Shetterly reminded Mrs. Johnson of her persistence in the late 1950s, when she successfully pressed her supervisor into admitting her into traditionally   meetings. â\\x80\\x9cYou took matters in your own hands,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Shetterly said. â\\x80\\x9cFor other women, it was a revelation. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Johnson said: â\\x80\\x9cWell, I donâ\\x80\\x99t ever wait for something. I remember asking the question, â\\x80\\x98Is there a law?â\\x80\\x99 And he said, â\\x80\\x98Let her go.â\\x80\\x99 It was easier than arguing. â\\x80\\x9d Listening in, one of Mrs. Johnsonâ\\x80\\x99s health aides chuckled. â\\x80\\x9cYep,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the Katherine Johnson I know. â\\x80\\x9d Though outwardly their stories are remarkable, both Mrs. Darden and Mrs. Johnson remained    when describing their careers, an attitude that seems to have prevailed among their peers. Ann Hammond, whose mother, Dorothy Vaughan, was one of the first black women to be hired by what was then called the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NACA, in 1943, said her mother never wanted a pat on the back. Mrs. Vaughan died in 2005 at the age of 98, and is played in the film by Octavia Spencer. â\\x80\\x9cMy mother wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve probably said, â\\x80\\x98I was just doing my job,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Hammond, 80, said, speaking in the Hampton bungalow where she grew up with her five siblings. But what jobs they were. While military budget cuts and sequestration have hurt the economy here in recent decades, some 75 years ago the hungry wartime machine needed manpower, and womanpower, to fill its depleted ranks. This helped open the door for black female mathematicians, who were recruited through job bulletin boards and newspaper ads. Their job title? â\\x80\\x9cColored computers. â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Johnson, a math savant, graduated summa cum laude from what is now West Virginia State University at 18, and heard about the job through a family connection. Mrs. Darden, who went to college at Hampton Institute and earned a masterâ\\x80\\x99s degree in math at Virginia State College, was hired to be a NASA data analyst out of graduate school in 1967, and went on to become an aerospace engineer. The military boom lasted for decades, allowing the women and their families to have what Ms. Hammond described as a good life, despite enduring the indignities of segregation in the early years  â\\x80\\x94   working, eating and using restrooms apart from white colleagues. Ms. Shetterly discovered in her research that the space agencyâ\\x80\\x99s leaders were well aware of the negative effects of segregation.

       " \"FBI Releases Files on Bill Clinton's Cash for Pardons Scandal November 1, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \\nThe FBI has an early present for Hillary Clinton. It's the files from the time her husband decided to pardon a wanted fugitive in exchange for cash. That fugitive was a fellow by the name of Marc Rich. His prosecutor? James Comey. \\nThe FBI unexpectedly released 129 pages of documents related to an investigation closed without charges in 2005 into President Bill Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s pardon of Marc Rich, who had been married to a wealthy Democratic donor. \\nThe unusual timing of the release was the result of a Freedom of Information Act request that had been completed and was posted under standard FBI practice, according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. But the Clinton campaign immediately questioned the timing of the release. \\nWell of course it did. It's never especially wise to pick fights with people who have a lot of dirt on you. \\nThe investigation stemmed from one of several pardons Clinton made on the last day of his presidency in 2001, that of financier and international fugitive Marc Rich, whose ex-wife Denise had given to the Democratic National Committee and the entity that would later become the Clinton Foundation. \\nAnd there's a surprise guest. \\nWhile the files may seem dated, they invoke figures beyond the Clintons who went on to play key roles in official Washington -- including Comey. \\nHe served as prosecutor in charge of a legal case against Rich from 1987 to 1993. As the U.S. attorney in Manhattan in 2002, Comey took over a criminal investigation of Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s pardons. â\\x80\\x9cI was stunnedâ\\x80\\x9d at the Rich pardon, Comey wrote in a letter to lawmakers in 2008. \\nClinton's people are fuming, but it was a standard FIOA request and there's nothing big here. It's just one of those things the Clintons should have gone to jail for. But didn't. Another of those.\",\n",
       " 'While Republicans try to make Louisiana s deadly floods  Obama s Katrina,  there is only one person getting flack for being a raging opportunist   you guessed it   Donald Trump.Louisiana s Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, blasted the Republican nominee for president after he showed up to Louisiana for a photo opportunity. While citizens are dying and being displaced by the thousands, Trump has decided he would exploit the carnage in an attempt to undermine President Obama.Remember when President Obama was chided by the GOP for not calling Gov. Rick Scott for two days after the Orlando massacre? Well, flooding has been going on in Louisiana for a week and still, Donald Trump has not reached out to the governor or any state leader tasked with handling the crisis. A spokesman for the governor pointed out:Donald Trump hasn t called the governor to inform him of his visit. We welcome him to LA but not for a photo-op. Instead we hope he ll consider volunteering or making a sizable donation to the LA Flood Relief Fund to help the victims of the storm.Trump, the self described billionaire and charitable man, should donate.While Republicans continue to bash President Obama, Edwards has gone on the record asking that President Obama not travel to Louisiana for at least a week until the state is more secure   out of respect and timeliness of those working to aid the state.Trump s newest campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the trip is  a decidedly nonpolitical event, no press allowed, going to help people on the ground who are in need. And what did Trump do as soon as she said that? He took questions from the press and said President Obama would rather play golf than help those affected in Louisiana. Even though President Obama has secured the relief funds for the state and has expressed his support and thoughts for those affected, the Trump train has decided to use the opportunity to smear him and once again make Trump look like the unsung hero of the day.So much for no media and not being political.Once again, Trump is exploiting and using people s pain for personal gain. He s done that his entire life, so why stop now.Featured image via Joshua Lott/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - Following is the full text of remarks from President Barack Obama on Saturday on the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. THE PRESIDENT: Good evening, everybody.Â\\xa0For almost 30 years, Justice Antonin â\\x80\\x98Ninoâ\\x80\\x99 Scalia was a larger-than-life presence on the bench - a brilliant legal mind with an energetic style, incisive wit, and colorful opinions. He influenced a generation of judges, lawyers, and students, and profoundly shaped the legal landscape.Â\\xa0He will no doubt be remembered as one of the most consequential judges and thinkers to serve on the Supreme Court. Justice Scalia dedicated his life to the cornerstone of our democracy:Â\\xa0the rule of law.Â\\xa0Tonight, we honor his extraordinary service to our nation and remember one of the towering legal figures of our time. Antonin Scalia was born in Trenton, New Jersey to an Italian immigrant family.Â\\xa0After graduating from Georgetown University and Harvard Law School, he worked at a law firm and taught law before entering a life of public service.Â\\xa0He rose from Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel to Judge on the D.C. Circuit Court, to Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. A devout Catholic, he was the proud father of nine children and grandfather to many loving grandchildren.Â\\xa0Justice Scalia was both an avid hunter and an opera lover - a passion for music that he shared with his dear colleague and friend, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg.Â\\xa0Michelle and I were proud to welcome him to the White House, including in 2012 for a state dinner for Prime Minister David Cameron.Â\\xa0And tonight, we join his fellow justices in mourning this remarkable man. Obviously, today is a time to remember Justice Scaliaâ\\x80\\x99s legacy.Â\\xa0I plan to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in due time.Â\\xa0There will be plenty of time for me to do so, and for the Senate to fulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote. These are responsibilities that I take seriously, as should everyone.Â\\xa0Theyâ\\x80\\x99re bigger than any one party.Â\\xa0They are about our democracy.Â\\xa0Theyâ\\x80\\x99re about the institution to which Justice Scalia dedicated his professional life, and making sure it continues to function as the beacon of justice that our Founders envisioned. But at this moment, we most of all want to think about his family, and Michelle and I join the nation in sending our deepest sympathies to Justice Scaliaâ\\x80\\x99s wife, Maureen, and their loving family - a beautiful symbol of a life well lived.Â\\xa0We thank them for sharing Justice Scalia with our country. God bless them all, and God bless the United States of America. ',\n",

Die â\\x80\\x9eReichsbÃ¼rgerâ\\x80\\x9c gehen davon aus, dass das Deutsche Reich vÃ¶lkerrechtlich bis heute fortbestehe, da die Weimarer Reichsverfassung weder von den Nationalsozialisten noch von den alliierten SiegermÃ¤chten des Zweiten Weltkriegs jemals abgeschafft wurde.

Sie versuchen sich intelligent zu verhalten und solche Dinge zu verschleiern. Somit mÃ¼ssen diese Personen durch den Verfassungsschutz beobachtet werden, um auch mÃ¶glicherweise ein verfassungsfeindliches Vorgehen zu erkennen und dementsprechend durch den Staat reagieren zu kÃ¶nnen. Die ReichbÃ¼rger sind kein geschlossener Verein, wie z.B. die NPD. Somit gibt es keine geschlossene Organisation, die man verbieten kÃ¶nnte. Man muss immer gegen einen einzelnen ReichbÃ¼rger verfahren und sehen, wo dieser Gesetze verletzt hat.

       " 'For someone who promoted his management skills and campaigned as an â\\x80\\x9corganizational genius,â\\x80\\x9d as Anderson Cooper of CNN put it, it has been a rocky White House debut for Donald J. Trump, the first president to go directly from the executive suite to the Oval Office. â\\x80\\x9cChaosâ\\x80\\x9d seems to be the word most often invoked, closely followed by â\\x80\\x9cturmoil. â\\x80\\x9d (One exception: the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, who said he preferred â\\x80\\x9c . â\\x80\\x9d) In less than two weeks, Mr. Trump created upheaval at the nationâ\\x80\\x99s borders, alienated longtime allies, roiled markets with talk of a trade war and prompted some of the largest protests any president has faced. The conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal bemoaned a refugee policy â\\x80\\x9cso poorly explained and prepared for, that it has produced confusion and fear at airports, an immediate legal defeat, and political fury at home and abroad. â\\x80\\x9d Even the top House Republican, Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who had released a statement praising the immigration order, later distanced himself, saying, â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s regrettable that there was some confusion with the rollout. â\\x80\\x9d All new presidents undergo a learning curve. But Mr. Trump promised a seamless transition and, with a real chief executive in charge as opposed to a career politician, an administration that would function as a   machine. So it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem premature to ask some leading management experts for an assessment of Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s first weeks, purely from the viewpoint of organizational behavior and management effectiveness, as I did this week. The unanimous verdict: Thus far, the Trump administration is a textbook case of how not to run a complex organization like the executive branch. â\\x80\\x9cThis is so basic, itâ\\x80\\x99s covered in the introduction to the M. B. A. program that all our students take,â\\x80\\x9d said Lindred Greer, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. By all outward indications, Mr. Trump â\\x80\\x9cdesperately needs to take the course,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford and the author of â\\x80\\x9cPower: Why Some People Have It and Others Donâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s executive actions as president â\\x80\\x9care so far from any responsible management approachâ\\x80\\x9d that they all but defy analysis. â\\x80\\x9cOf course, this isnâ\\x80\\x99t new,â\\x80\\x9d he told me. â\\x80\\x9cHis campaign also violated every prudent management principle. Everyone including our friends on Wall Street somehow believed that once he was president heâ\\x80\\x99d change. I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand that logic. â\\x80\\x9d Wall Street did take notice. After months of cheering the prospect of tax reform and infrastructure spending, investors sold stocks after a weekend of chaos at the nationâ\\x80\\x99s airports connected to the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s executive order on immigration. On Monday, the Dow industrials experienced the biggest   decline since the election, fueled by worries that a dysfunctional White House wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be able to execute Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s policies. â\\x80\\x9cIf you thought immigration was bad, just wait for health care,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Pfeffer warned. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. There is an enormous amount of literature and data exploring what constitutes effective management of complicated organizations. â\\x80\\x9cThe core principles have served many leaders really well,â\\x80\\x9d said Jeffrey T. Polzer, professor of human resource management at Harvard Business School. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s really common sense: You want to surround yourself with talented people who have the most expertise, who bring different perspectives to the issue at hand. Then you foster debate and invite different points of view in order to reach a   solution. â\\x80\\x9d This is often easier said than done. It â\\x80\\x9crequires an openness to being challenged, and some   and even humility to acknowledge that there are areas where other people know more than you do,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Polzer continued. â\\x80\\x9cThis doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean decisions are made by consensus. The person at the top makes the decisions, but based on the facts and expertise necessary to make a good decision. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump has already violated several of these core principles. The secretary of Homeland Security, John F. Kelly, was still discussing a proposed executive order restricting immigration when Mr. Trump went ahead and signed it. Nor was Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, consulted he saw the final order only hours before it went into effect. Not to consult thoroughly with top cabinet officers before deciding on the order â\\x80\\x9cis insane,â\\x80\\x9d since they â\\x80\\x9chave the expertise and should be on top of the data,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Greer said. â\\x80\\x9cIgnoring them leads to bad decisions and is also incredibly demoralizing. â\\x80\\x9d And thereâ\\x80\\x99s another reason to consult, Mr. Polzer said: â\\x80\\x9cWhen people are genuinely involved in a decision and their input is heard and valued and respected, they are more likely to support and buy into the decision and be motivated to execute to the best of their abilities, even if the decision doesnâ\\x80\\x99t go their way. â\\x80\\x9d Conversely, people who arenâ\\x80\\x99t consulted feel they have no stake in a successful outcome. Far from encouraging and weighing differing views as part of the   process, Mr. Trump appears to view dissension as disloyalty. After career State Department officers circulated a draft cable questioning the effectiveness of the immigration ban, Mr. Spicer responded, â\\x80\\x9cThey should either get with the program or they can go. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDebate and dissent are essential to reaching any thoughtful outcome,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Greer said. Comments like Mr. Spicerâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cwill discourage anyone from speaking up. You end up with group think, an echo chamber where people only say what they think the president wants to hear. â\\x80\\x9d And while itâ\\x80\\x99s understandable that the president was eager to act swiftly to follow through on his campaign promises  â\\x80\\x94   he had made a long list of actions to be carried out on â\\x80\\x9cDay 1â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   his directives came across as needlessly hasty and poorly thought through. Some had to be reframed (talk of a Mexican border surcharge) or significantly modified and clarified after the fact (immigration policy). I asked the management experts to ignore their views about the merits of Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s policies, but all said that execution and substance are inextricably linked. â\\x80\\x9cWhen youâ\\x80\\x99re on the receiving end of a policy decision, the merits of the decision and the execution go hand in hand,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Polzer said. â\\x80\\x9cIf either one is done poorly, the outcomes will be bad. Even good plans that are poorly rolled out arenâ\\x80\\x99t going to work well. â\\x80\\x9d For many people, the Affordable Care Act was indelibly tainted by the computer malfunctions that plagued its start. Similarly, for many Americans, the enduring image of Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s immigration policy will be that of a tearful Iraqi immigrant who was detained at Kennedy International Airport after risking his life working as a translator for the American military over a   period. (He was released after lawyers intervened on his behalf.) That prompted even Mr. Ryan to say, â\\x80\\x9cNo one wanted to see people with green cards or special immigrant visas, like translators, get caught up in all of this. â\\x80\\x9d Some Trump defenders have said that the president thrives on chaos, and it has proved to be an effective management approach for him in the past. But every expert I consulted said there is no empirical data or research that supports the notion that chaos is a productive management tool. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not aware of anyone who advocates that,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Polzer said. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t really know whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on in the White House, so I donâ\\x80\\x99t feel comfortable commenting on that specifically. But I can say in general that in organizational settings, less chaos is a good thing. â\\x80\\x9d Everyone agreed that there was still time for Mr. Trump to right the ship. Other administrations have had course corrections and personnel  . But having to reorganize only weeks into a first term is not promising. If this were the private sector, â\\x80\\x9csomeone would be fired,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Greer said. That seems highly unlikely, since Mr. Trump has not even acknowledged a problem, instead blaming the media for an impression of upheaval in the White House. That is a fundamental problem, Mr. Pfeffer said. â\\x80\\x9cNo good business makes decisions that are based on falsehoods,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cMy sense is that Trump takes no oneâ\\x80\\x99s counsel but his own. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s bad management, period. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has agreed to meet with representatives of the oil refining industry and their legislative backers to discuss the nationâ\\x80\\x99s biofuels program, according to two sources briefed on the matter. The White House meeting could set the stage for negotiations over possible legislation to overhaul the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard - a 2005 law that requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the nationâ\\x80\\x99s gasoline each year, the sources said, asking not to be named. While the regulation would be a boon to the Midwest corn belt, refining companies oppose it because it cuts into their petroleum-based fuel market share, and because they say the blending requirement costs them hundreds of millions of dollars. Lawmakers representing both industries have in recent months threatened to block administration nominations over the White Houseâ\\x80\\x99s handling of the issue, including most recently Texas Senator Ted Cruz - who said he will hold up the nomination of Bill Northey to a federal agriculture post until he gets a meeting with Trump on biofuels. â\\x80\\x9cThe president was briefed, and has agreed on a meeting. Now it is just a matter of finding an hour window,â\\x80\\x9d one of the sources told Reuters. He said he was told by the White House the meeting is likely to be set for the week of Dec. 11. A White House official declined to comment. Cruz and eight other senators from states with oil refineries - including Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania - had requested the meeting with Trump in a letter in October to discuss the regulation. In the letter, the senators asked that the meeting include Midwest lawmakers, biofuels representatives and relevant administration officials, so all sides could â\\x80\\x9cdiscuss a pathway forward toward a mutually agreeable solution.â\\x80\\x9d It is unlikely Trump would be able to move to reform the biofuels program without buy-in from the corn coalition. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a vocal biofuels backer, has said that such a meeting would be a â\\x80\\x9cwaste of time.â\\x80\\x9d His office declined to comment on whether Grassley would attend. â\\x80\\x9cNo meeting has been scheduled,â\\x80\\x9d his spokesman Michael Zona said. A spokesman for Senator Cruz did not comment. The Renewable Fuel Standard was introduced more than a decade ago by then-President George W. Bush as a way to boost U.S. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions. A number of independent refiners, like Valero Energy Corp, CVR Energy and PBF Energy have vocally opposed the regulationâ\\x80\\x99s requirement that refiners blend the biofuels, or purchase credits from rivals that do - a rule they say costs them hundreds of millions of dollars each year. CVRâ\\x80\\x99s majority owner, billionaire Carl Icahn, served for months as a top adviser to Trump on regulation. During that time he pushed to shift the responsibility for blending away from refiners to supply terminals or distributors.  But Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s administration has so far not budged.  The Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the program, slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for 2018 and has rejected proposals to shift the blending burden, or to allow ethanol exports to count towards volumes targets.

       " 'A Brooklyn man who beat a transgender woman to death after he had started flirting with her was sentenced to 12 years in prison on Tuesday, a penalty the victimâ\\x80\\x99s family said was too light. The man, James Dixon, 25, pleaded guilty to manslaughter this month in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, admitting he attacked the woman, Islan Nettles, on a street in Harlem just after midnight on Aug. 17, 2013, knocking her to the pavement with a punch, then hitting her again as she lay on the sidewalk. Ms. Nettles, 21, an assistant at a fashion company, died five days later of head injuries, prompting vigils and protests by transgender people who said her death was emblematic of the violence they often face because of their sexual identity. While Ms. Nettles was still in a coma, Mr. Dixon turned himself in to the police. In written and videotaped statements, he told detectives that he had started flirting with Ms. Nettles, unaware she was transgender, after meeting her and her two friends on the street. He said he became enraged and attacked her when his friends began mocking him for trying to pick up a transgender woman. â\\x80\\x9cI just didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to be fooled,â\\x80\\x9d he said in a videotaped statement. The victimâ\\x80\\x99s mother, Delores Nettles, told the court she believed 12 years was too light a sentence, given the brutal beating her daughter took. â\\x80\\x9cHe can go home after those 12 years and see his family,â\\x80\\x9d she said in tears. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not fair. â\\x80\\x9d Turning to Mr. Dixon, she said: â\\x80\\x9cHow can you sleep at night? How can you rest? I canâ\\x80\\x99t rest. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Dixon showed no emotion. He declined to make a statement before Justice Daniel P. Conviser pronounced the sentence, which had been negotiated with the judge on the eve of the trial in return for a guilty plea. Prosecutors objected to the deal they had sought a sentence of at least 17 years.',\n",

The taxpayer-funded guide   entitled  Career corner: Understanding microaggressions    also identifies golf outings and the words  boyfriend  and  girlfriend  as microagressions.The UNC Chapel Hill guide, published on Thursday, covers a wide range of menacing microaggressions   which are everyday words that radical leftists have decided to be angry or frustrated about.Christmas vacations are a microagression, the public university pontificates, because  academic calendars and encouraged vacations  which  are organized around major religious observances  centralize  the Christian faith  and diminish  non-Christian spiritual rituals and observances. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill issued a guide this week which instructs students that Christmas vacations and telling a woman  I love your shoes!  are  microagressions. The microagression of liking shoes occurs when someone says  I love your shoes!   to a woman in leadership during a Q & A after a speech.  So it s a very specific microagression. The problem, the University of North Carolina document declares, is that the shoe admirer values appearances  more than   intellectual contributions. Similarly, the public school pronounces, interrupting any woman who is speaking is a microagression.Golf outings are also a microagression, the University of North Carolina says, because suggesting a  staff retreat at the country club  or even just  a round of golf   assumes employees have the financial resources  to participate in the  fairly expensive and inaccessible sport. (As an aside, daily greens fees at the gorgeous UNC Finley Golf Club range from $30   for students   to $40 for professors and administrators.)The words  boyfriend  and  girlfriend    as well as  husband  and  wife    are microaggressions, the University of North Carolina admonishes, because these words set  the expectation that people do not identify as LGBTQ until they say otherwise or disclose their sexual orientation.  The correct terms are now  partner  and  spouse,  UNC Chapel Hill demands.In this same vein, bureaucratic forms only containing the options  male  and  female  are microagressions, the taxpayer-funded flagship school says. It s also a microagression to refer to men who dress up as women with the pronouns  he  or  him,  UNC Chapel Hill scolds.Still more microagressions cited by UNC Chapel Hill include complimenting a foreign-born person s English skills, saying  I get ADHD sometimes  and telling a person you don t judge them by the color of their skinThe two lady authors of the UNC Chapel Hill microagressions guide are Sharbari Dey, an assistant director of multicultural affairs, and Krista Prince, a dorm life coordinator.In order to counter the multitude of microagressions listed in their document, Dey and Prince advise students to respond by interrupting and aggressively asking,  What did you mean by that? UNC Chapel Hill is home to a  cultural competency workshop  which instructs that white people are privileged because they can buy Band-Aids  in  flesh  color and have them more or less match  their vaguely beige-hued skin. At least some students have apparently been required to participate in the workshop.Via: Daily Caller   h/t Campus Reform ',\n",
       " 'ABU DHABI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s defense secretary said bad weather had forced him to scrap a visit to Afghanistan on Sunday but added that he was reviewing the next steps in the war after discussions with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and the top U.S. commander. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re putting our thoughts together now,â\\x80\\x9d Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters in Abu Dhabi during his debut trip to the Middle East. U.S. General John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. and international troops in Afghanistan, said this month the NATO-led force in Afghanistan had enough troops to carry out counterterrorism missions but had â\\x80\\x9ca shortfall of a few thousandâ\\x80\\x9d for its major role of advising Afghan security forces. Mattis said he spoke for several hours on Sunday via video-link with Nicholson, but did not disclose whether he was in favor of sending more U.S. forces there. Mattis also said he spoke with Ghani â\\x80\\x9cat lengthâ\\x80\\x9d before leaving Munich, Germany, on Saturday. So far, Trump has offered little clarity about whether he will approve more forces for Afghanistan, where some 8,400 U.S. troops remain more than 15 years after the Islamist Taliban government was toppled.  â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s waiting for my assessment and the assessment from the intelligence community and heâ\\x80\\x99s open to my advice on it,â\\x80\\x9d Mattis said. â\\x80\\x9cBut first of all Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to formulate where I stand.â\\x80\\x9d Afghan government forces control no more than two-thirds of national territory, and have struggled to contain the Taliban insurgency since the bulk of NATO soldiers withdrew at the end of 2014. The government is also struggling with other militants, particularly from Islamic Stateâ\\x80\\x99s Afghanistan branch. Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide attack that killed at least 22 people on Feb. 7 outside Afghanistanâ\\x80\\x99s Supreme Court. A number of provincial capitals have been under pressure from the Taliban and Afghan government forces have been suffering high casualty rates, with more than 5,500 killed in the first eight months of 2016. â\\x80\\x9cThe Afghan security forces paid a very heavy price to keep the Taliban on their back foot. But they paid it, they held,â\\x80\\x9d Mattis said. â\\x80\\x9cAnd the Talibanâ\\x80\\x99s in a worse position today, even though I do not equate that to success on our side.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",
       " 'BEIRUT, Lebanon  â\\x80\\x94   Negotiations are underway to extend a fragile   agreement in Syria to the embattled northern city of Aleppo, which a surge of violence has  nearly torn apart in recent weeks, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday. â\\x80\\x9cIn the last weeks, the cessation of hostilities has been put to the test, and it has frayed in certain areas, and it has fallen completely in a few areas,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kerry said in Geneva after meeting with the United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura. Mr. Kerry said he was particularly disturbed about air raids on a hospital and three health clinics in Aleppo, for which he blamed President Bashar  â\\x80\\x99s government. â\\x80\\x9cThe regime has clearly indicated the willingness, over a period of time now, to attack first responders, to attack health care workers and rescue workers,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kerry said. â\\x80\\x9cAnd the attack on this hospital is unconscionable, under any standard anywhere. It has to stop. â\\x80\\x9d He added that â\\x80\\x9cboth sides  â\\x80\\x94   the opposition and the regime  â\\x80\\x94   have contributed to this chaos. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kerry said that he planned to talk to his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, on Monday evening, and that Mr. de Mistura would travel to Moscow on Tuesday, all part of an effort to restore a fragile   that was brokered in February, with American and Russian support, and is now at risk of collapse. Mr. Kerry urged Russia to pressure Mr. Assad to stop the attacks. â\\x80\\x9cThis is the moment to try to make certain that what everybody has signed up to is, in fact, being delivered, being lived up to, without hypocrisy and without variation. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kerry said there could be no â\\x80\\x9clegitimate political talksâ\\x80\\x9d until both parties carried out the agreement  â\\x80\\x94   a full cessation of hostilities throughout the country and the nationwide delivery of humanitarian aid. â\\x80\\x9cAnd yet one party is blatantly violating that agreement,â\\x80\\x9d he said, referring to the Syrian government. Speaking at a news conference with Mr. de Mistura, Mr. Kerry said that the deal was fraying in some areas and had collapsed in others and that legitimate talks on a   were impossible unless all of the involved parties were committed to it. Mr. Kerry said that Russia and the United States would add personnel in Geneva so that the   agreement could be monitored    â\\x80\\x94   a declaration that left the unsettling impression that until now, the agreement, promoted as being of ultimate importance, had not been monitored around the clock by its sponsors. Mr. de Mistura added a note of reality, saying he appreciated that while Russia and the United States were developing an improved   monitoring system, â\\x80\\x9cwe need the political will otherwise we would have only a mechanism. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell said,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kerry said. Asked repeatedly whether he trusted the Russian government on the efforts to restore a truce in Aleppo, Mr. Kerry declined to answer. In noting that the partial truce had fallen apart in some parts of Syria, Mr. Kerry acknowledged what has been clear for more than a week on the ground: The relative respite from violence brought by the   reduction in hostilities has come to a resounding end in many areas, especially Aleppo, where more than 200 people have died in the past week, most of them civilians. About   of those deaths have been on the   side of town, which is being pummeled anew by airstrikes and by bombs dropped from helicopters, including on a hospital. But both sides have demonstrated a disregard for civilian life, with rebels firing mortar shells and missiles last week toward most of the   neighborhoods in Aleppo, in one of their worst barrages in recent months. Yet as Mr. Kerry carries out shuttle diplomacy to try to revive the partial truce, it has been renewed in several areas, but not in Aleppo, where it is needed most. The Syrian Army said in a statement on Monday that a temporary truce in the suburbs of Damascus and in the coastal province of Latakia would be extended for an additional 48 hours. The Tass news agency in Russia quoted Lt. Gen. Sergei Kurylenko, head of the Russian coordination center in Syria, as saying only that talks about a   for Aleppo were continuing. The sticking point is apparently an unwillingness by Russia to tell the Syrian government to stop its aerial bombardments on   areas there. Mr. Kerry, as well as residents and opposition figures, say the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s warplanes, in a campaign aided by Russia, are mainly hitting areas not controlled by the Nusra Front, which has a small presence in Aleppo. Instead, they are believed to be striking areas controlled by other insurgent groups, including some backed by the United States and its allies. The United States is considering whether to draw up a map of safe zones where civilians and members of moderate opposition groups could seek shelter from attacks by Mr. Assadâ\\x80\\x99s military, The Associated Press reported. It was not immediately clear whether Russia would accept such a plan, or could persuade the Assad government to respect the zones. Such an agreement is also unlikely to be helpful if the sides cannot agree on what constitutes the violations the monitors are supposed to be watching for. Even if   hard lines were drawn on a map, and civilians and insurgents not affiliated with the Nusra Front were encouraged to go there, the plan would face major practical problems, given the difficulty of moving safely within the city. Rebel groups may not agree to give up areas that Russia believes are held by the Nusra Front, arguing that, in fact, they are held by local opposition fighters and seeing the plan as a ploy to allow the government to take them back.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates hardened their  positions on Sunday on blocking a move by President Barack Obama to fill the Supreme Court seat left by the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, a lifetime appointment that would help decide some of the most divisive issues facing Americans.  The next justice could tilt the balance of the nationâ\\x80\\x99s highest court, which was left with four conservatives and four liberals. The vacancy quickly became an issue in the 2016 presidential race. â\\x80\\x9cWe ought to make the 2016 election a referendum on the Supreme Court,â\\x80\\x9d U.S. Senator and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said on NBCâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cMeet the Press.â\\x80\\x9d The normally nine-justice court is set to decide this year its first major abortion case in nearly a decade, as well as cases on voting rights, affirmative action and immigration. Scalia, 79, died on Saturday at a West Texas resort. The cause of death will not be determined for several days, the top official in the county where he died, Presidio County Judge Cinderela Gueara, said on Sunday in an interview with local TV station WFAA-TV. Obama, a Democrat, will nominate someone to fill the empty seat but will wait until the U.S. Senate is back in session, the White House said on Sunday. The Senate returns from recess on Feb. 22. â\\x80\\x9cAt that point, we expect the Senate to consider that nominee, consistent with their responsibilities laid out in the United States Constitution,â\\x80\\x9d White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. The White House declined to give a more specific timeline for Obama to announce his nominee. The nomination will set up a battle with the Republican-controlled chamber, which must approve any nominee. Shortly after news of Scaliaâ\\x80\\x99s death, Republicans vowed not to act on the vacancy until Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s successor takes office next January. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said failure to act would be a â\\x80\\x9cshameful abdicationâ\\x80\\x9d of the Senateâ\\x80\\x99s constitutional duty. Both sides said history was on their side.  Reid said it would be unprecedented to have a vacancy on the court for a year. In the modern era, the longest Supreme Court vacancy was 363 days after Abe Fortas resigned in May 1969.  Republicans cited 80 years of tradition in which no Supreme Court nominees were approved in presidential election years. In fact, Justice Anthony Kennedy was approved in 1988, after a bruising battle in which the Senate rejected President Ronald Reaganâ\\x80\\x99s first nominee, conservative Robert Bork. Supreme Court nominations are rare, so neither side has much data to rely on in determining precedents. History is also an unreliable guide as the nomination process has become significantly more politicized in recent years. For Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s previous two Supreme Court picks, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, he took about 30 days each to announce the elections after their predecessors, Justice John Paul Stevens and Justice David Souter, respectively, said they planned to step down. Ohio Governor John Kasich, a moderate among the Republicans vying for the White House, said the Senate should wait because a battle this year would only deepen divisions in the country. â\\x80\\x9cYou know how polarized everything is,â\\x80\\x9d Kasich said on ABCâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cThis Week.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to see is more fighting and more recrimination.â\\x80\\x9d Democratic U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy warned that a delay could have consequences in Novemberâ\\x80\\x99s election, when voters get to decide who fills one-third of the Senateâ\\x80\\x99s seats. â\\x80\\x9cIf the Republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing, I think that is going to guarantee they lose control of the Senate, because I donâ\\x80\\x99t think the American people will stand for that,â\\x80\\x9d he said on CNNâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cState of the Union.â\\x80\\x9d    Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said the Constitution was clear. â\\x80\\x9cThe president makes the appointment, Senate confirms, letâ\\x80\\x99s get on with that business,â\\x80\\x9d the senator from Vermont said on â\\x80\\x9cFox News Sunday.â\\x80\\x9d One possible contender to replace Scalia is an Indian-American appeals court judge, Sri Srinivasan, who has pro-business credentials and a stellar resume. His nomination could make it more politically challenging for Republicans to block anyone put forward by Obama. Cruz, a Texas lawmaker, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee that takes the lead on Supreme Court nominees, said the vacancy left by Scalia made the presidential election even more critical. He warned that a justice chosen by Sanders or his Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, would mean the Second Amendment right to bear arms would be â\\x80\\x9cwritten outâ\\x80\\x9d of the Constitution and abortion on demand would become the law of the land.  Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another White House candidate, said he would want someone who echoed Scaliaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9coriginalistâ\\x80\\x9d ideology that looks at the U.S. Constitution through the lens of its framersâ\\x80\\x99 18th-century intentions. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, appearing on NBC, was more direct when asked what he would want: â\\x80\\x9cSomeone just like Justice Scalia.â\\x80\\x9d That would mean someone who did not let ideological differences preclude civility or even friendship, former President Bill Clinton told CNN, citing Scaliaâ\\x80\\x99s bond with liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Ginsburg, in a statement on Sunday, called her friend â\\x80\\x9ca jurist of captivating brilliance and witâ\\x80\\x9d with whom she disagreed â\\x80\\x9cnow and then.â\\x80\\x9d She cited a duet sung by the two justices in the 2015 opera â\\x80\\x9cScalia/Ginsburgâ\\x80\\x9d titled: â\\x80\\x9cWe are different, we are one.â\\x80\\x9d She and Scalia, Ginsburg wrote, were â\\x80\\x9cdifferent in our interpretation of written texts, one in our reverence for the Constitution and the institution we serve.â\\x80\\x9d  (Additional reporting by Joan Biskupic, Alana Wise, Timothy Gardner in Washington; Sara Vasquez in Marfa, Texas; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Peter Cooney) SAP is the sponsor of this content.

       " 'Only one American has ever won an Olympic gold medal in judo: Kayla Harrison. And she has won two, in London in 2012 and in Rio this year. Yet despite her achievements, Harrison is the countryâ\\x80\\x99s   famous judoka. No. 1 is her former roommate Ronda Rousey, who won a bronze medal in 2008 and went on to fame, fortune and magazine covers as the   fighter in mixed martial arts. Now Harrison, 26, plans to follow her into the cage, in the World Series of Fighting organization. â\\x80\\x9cIf you had peeked through our apartment window in 2007 and said, â\\x80\\x98One of you is going to win two Olympic gold medals, and one is going to become a sports icon,â\\x80\\x99 we both would have said: â\\x80\\x98What are you talking about? Weâ\\x80\\x99re eating ramen noodles and barely getting by,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Harrison said. â\\x80\\x9cFour years ago, if I wanted to be an M. M. A. athlete, itâ\\x80\\x99s not something a female could really make a lot of money doing. â\\x80\\x9d Harrison said. Referring to Rousey, she added: â\\x80\\x9cShe trailblazed a way for girls like me who want to make some money. Iâ\\x80\\x99m hoping to stand on top of her shoulders and continue to have judo girls kill it in the cage. â\\x80\\x9d It will be quite a change for Harrison. The   world of Olympic sports like judo is vastly different from the colorful, crazy scene of mixed martial arts. When asked about a possible career in mixed martial arts after winning her second gold medal, in August, Harrison said, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know if Iâ\\x80\\x99m cut out for a world where you get fights by how pretty you are and how you talk. â\\x80\\x9d She stands by that remark, but said: â\\x80\\x9cThe World Series of Fighting is looking to bring some legitimacy to the sport, and have real athletes who are treated like real athletes, not W. W. E. superstars. I hope to see it go more toward the professional route versus the entertainment route, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m not in charge. â\\x80\\x9d The man who is, Carlos Silva, the chief executive, said: â\\x80\\x9cI want people to perceive it as a sport, not just a show. A big part of that is adding sporting people like Kayla. â\\x80\\x9d Harrison competed in judo at 172 pounds but expects to fight at 145 pounds. (Such discrepancies are not unusual Rousey competed in judo at 154 but fights in the Ultimate Fighting Championship at its highest weight class, 135.) Women at 145 pounds have been somewhat overlooked in mixed martial arts in favor of smaller fighters. The World Series of Fighting expects to add athletes to build up the division with its new star in mind. The biggest name in the heavier division is Cristiane Justino, known universally as Cyborg. Currently signed with the U. F. C. she is a fearsome competitor with a   record and a brutal knockout punch. A match between her and Rousey, if it could be arranged, would undoubtedly be one of the biggest in mixed martial arts history. The bigger Harrison, though, might be a more natural matchup for Cyborg down the road. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not going to go out in my first fight and fight Cyborg,â\\x80\\x9d Harrison said. â\\x80\\x9cThat would be crazy. â\\x80\\x9d But she admitted: â\\x80\\x9cI had a dream the other night that I was fighting Cyborg and I got her in an armbar and I broke her arm. But she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t tap, so I choked her unconscious. â\\x80\\x9d In Rio, when Harrison was asked about a possible career in mixed martial arts, her longtime coach, Jimmy Pedro, sitting next to her, was seen shaking his head. â\\x80\\x9cThat pretty much sums up how he and his father feel about it,â\\x80\\x9d Harrison said of Pedro and his father, known as Big Jim. â\\x80\\x9cThey just feel like Iâ\\x80\\x99ve accomplished everything an athlete could ever dream of, having such an amazing career in judo. And I think personally they donâ\\x80\\x99t want to see me put that all on the line and see me get hurt. â\\x80\\x9d Still, Harrison will continue to work with the Pedros, as well as adding training in disciplines like boxing and wrestling. She said her serious training will begin in January. Harrison has no timetable for her first fight. She will start her mixed martial arts experience as a commentator for the World Series of Fightingâ\\x80\\x99s card at the Theater at Madison Square Garden on Dec. 31. The event will feature three championship bouts, including lightweight champ Justin Gaethje against JoÃ£o Zeferino. For a judoka transitioning into mixed martial arts, the biggest issue is striking, which is not allowed in judo. â\\x80\\x9cI feel I have a great base, because judo is takedowns and finishes, armbars, chokes,â\\x80\\x9d Harrison said. â\\x80\\x9cWhen youâ\\x80\\x99re doing judo, youâ\\x80\\x99re gripping, your hands are moving, so I already have that spatial awareness for striking, which I think gives me an advantage learning a new sport. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been doing the same thing for 20 years. Everything I do in judo I learned in the first six months with the Pedros. Now Iâ\\x80\\x99m learning new things. Iâ\\x80\\x99m learning heel hooks and knee bars and a jab and a hook, uppercuts. Itâ\\x80\\x99s invigorating. â\\x80\\x9d Still, Harrison is aware that the differences are there, and that they are real. Soon, for the first time, she will be hitting people in the face, and being hit in the face in return. â\\x80\\x9cJudo is controlled violence,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cJudo in Japanese means â\\x80\\x98the gentle way.â\\x80\\x99 Itâ\\x80\\x99s about disarming your opponent or defending yourself, but never killing them. But M. M. A. is   gladiating. So, yeah, Iâ\\x80\\x99m scared. Absolutely. I would be foolish not to be. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more to curb North Koreaâ\\x80\\x99s nuclear program and help reduce the gaping U.S. trade deficit with Beijing in talks on Friday, even as he toned down the strident anti-China rhetoric of his election campaign. Trump spoke publicly of progress on a range of issues in his first U.S.-China summit â\\x80\\x93 as did several of his top aides â\\x80\\x93 but they provided few concrete specifics other than Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s agreement to work together to narrow disagreements and find common ground for cooperation. As the two leaders wrapped up a Florida summit overshadowed by U.S. missile strikes in Syria overnight, Xi joined Trump in stressing the positive mood of the meetings while papering over deep differences that have caused friction between the worldâ\\x80\\x99s two biggest economies. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s aides insisted he had made good on his pledge to raise concerns about Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s trade practices and said there was some headway, with Xi agreeing to a 100-day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting U.S. exports and reducing Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s trade surplus with the United States. Speaking after the two-day summit at Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also said that Xi had agreed to increased cooperation in reining in North Koreaâ\\x80\\x99s missile and nuclear programs â\\x80\\x93 though he did not offer any new formula for cracking Pyongyangâ\\x80\\x99s defiant attitude.  Trump had promised during the campaign to stop what he called the theft of American jobs by China. Many blue-collar workers helped propel him to his unexpected election victory on Nov. 8 and Trump is under pressure to deliver for them. The Republican president tweeted last week that the United States could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses and that his meeting with Xi â\\x80\\x9cwill be a very difficult one.â\\x80\\x9d  On Friday, the unpredictable Trump not only set a different tone but also avoided any public lapses in protocol that Chinese officials had feared could embarrass their leader. â\\x80\\x9cWe have made tremendous progress in our relationship with China,â\\x80\\x9d Trump told reporters as the two delegations met around tables flanked by large U.S. and Chinese flags. â\\x80\\x9cWe will be making additional progress. The relationship developed by President Xi and myself I think is outstanding. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away,â\\x80\\x9d he added, without providing details. Xi also spoke in mostly positive terms. â\\x80\\x9cWe have engaged in deeper understanding, and have built a trust,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI believe we will keep developing in a stable way to form friendly relations ... For the peace and stability of the world, we will also fulfill our historical responsibility.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell, I agree with you 100 percent,â\\x80\\x9d Trump replied. Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s official Xinhua news agency said Xi had encouraged the United States to take part in the â\\x80\\x9cOne Belt, One Roadâ\\x80\\x9d plan, Xiâ\\x80\\x99s signature foreign policy imitative aimed at infrastructure development across Asia, Africa and Europe, seen in some policy circles as a partial answer to the pivot to Asia strategy of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s predecessor Barack Obama. Xi also hailed military to military exchanges and said China and the United States should â\\x80\\x9cmake good use of the dialogue mechanism to be established between the two countriesâ\\x80\\x99 joint staffs of the armed forcesâ\\x80\\x9d, although Xinhua did not give further details. Chinese state media on Saturday cheered the meeting as one that showed the world that confrontation between the two powers was not inevitable and established the tone for the development of U.S.-China relations. But in a sign that rough spots remained, Tillerson afterwards described the discussions as â\\x80\\x9cvery frank and candid.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPresident Trump and President Xi agreed to work in concert to expand areas of cooperation while managing differences based on mutual respect,â\\x80\\x9d he said. After the meeting, Trump took Xi on a walk around the manicured grounds of his lavish Spanish-style complex. Trump could be seen chatting and gesturing to Xi, who did the same. Tillerson said Trump had accepted Xiâ\\x80\\x99s invitation to visit China and that they also agreed to upgrade a U.S.-China dialogue by putting the two presidents at the head of the forum. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the Chinese had expressed an interest in reducing Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s trade surplus as a way of controlling their own inflation. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the first time Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard them say that in a bilateral context,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Ross declined to say whether the United States was ready to designate China a currency manipulator, however, referring to an upcoming report in which that issue would be addressed. Although Trump during the presidential election campaign had pledged to label China a currency manipulator on the first day of his administration, he has refrained from doing so.  The highly anticipated U.S.-China summit was upstaged by U.S. missile strikes overnight against a Syrian air base from which Trump said a deadly chemical weapon attack had been launched earlier in the week. It was the first direct U.S. assault on the Russian-backed government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in six years of civil war.  The swift action in Syria could be interpreted as a signal especially to defiant nuclear-armed North Korea â\\x80\\x93 and by extension, its ally China â\\x80\\x93 as well as other countries like Iran and Russia of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s willingness to use military force. North Korea is developing missiles capable of hitting the United States.

Our European partners agree with this,â\\x80\\x9d Medvedev said. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not speaking about the nature of these disputes but that we must protect our financial systems. China must protect its own system and Russia must protect its own system. Therefore, this cooperation is very useful as in this situation no-one will be capable of blocking the road of financial traffic,â\\x80\\x9d he emphasized.

Our country needs it as recently we have been plunged in a phase of such decline. Both European and US economies need it since they have not been gaining fast growth, to say nothing about Japan. Also, the Chinese economy needs it since it had been gathering speed in the past years but has slowed down later,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIt is closely watched by everyone as Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s economy is the most significant factor of the world economic growth.â\\x80\\x9d. Energy and high technology sectors \\nRussia and China may reach the goal of $200bln trade by 2020 but energy and high technology sectors along with traditional trade should move up a gear, Russian Prime Minister said. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndicators have been improving this year as a result of joint work of the two states, including our countriesâ\\x80\\x99 leaders, governments, ministries, agencies and businesses,â\\x80\\x9d Medvedev said. Russia, China intend to develop small satellite for Wi-Fi network \\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am convinced that if we move ahead like this, by 2020 we will be able to reach the trade of $200 billion worth. However, attention should be turned to key aspects of cooperation,â\\x80\\x9d he said explaining he implied the energy sector, with some projects like the Power of Siberia gas pipeline. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn 2015 construction of an eastern stretch of the gas pipeline was launched,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cAlso, it includes oil supplies along the Skovorodino-Mohe (oil pipeline) extension and construction of large facilities, in particular the construction of Unit 3 at the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant.â\\x80\\x9d \\nBesides, high-tech projects should be enhanced, he said. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cI mean wide-body jets, heavy helicopters and other projects in the high-tech sector,â\\x80\\x9d Medvedev said. â\\x80\\x9cIt seems to me that if we diversify trade like this, our countries will be quite capable of reaching the level which we agreed on several years ago,â\\x80\\x9d he said in conclusion.

       " 'Trump and the House GOP suffered a stunning defeat on legislation they promised would deliver better healthcare to millions, despite that promise being a lie. They pulled the Trumpcare bill from the floor early Friday afternoon, before getting a vote, because they knew it wouldn t pass. And that was absolutely humiliating for them.But what may be more humiliating is what the American Action Network a conservative PAC did on Friday night   the exact same day the bill failed. During Friday night basketball games, they ran television ads about the triumph of Trumpcare over Obamacare, saying the following: Republicans are keeping their promise with a new plan for better hrealthcare, More choices and lower costs, putting doctors and patients in charge again. No more big government penalties or job killing mandates. They go on to explain that the tax credits contained within Trumpcare would make healthcare more affordable, and that protections for people with pre-existing conditions would remain in place (which wasn t necessarily true).And then they do something truly amazing, given that these ads ran long after all the drama from the bill s death had quieted down.

The Democrat party is starting to make the mafia look like girl scouts .In a scathing video ad titled  Tale of Two Press Conferences,  the GOP plays side-by-side excerpts from Comey s statement and a March 10, 2015 press conference when Clinton was first cornered with accusations about her private email server.The result is a smackdown that casts Clinton as a bald-faced liar. I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email,  Clinton says in the footage on one side of a split-screen. 110 emails in 52 email chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information,  Comey says at screen-right.After Clinton says that she  thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two, Comey is seen rebutting her on Tuesday   declaring that she  used numerous mobile devices to view and send e-mail on [her] personal domain. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that Clinton  has spent the last 16 months looking into cameras deliberately lying to the American people.

       " 'Not too long after taking office, Trump decided to start asking around about how the government could roll back regulations and make it easier for companies to get their projects approved. But he didn t ask ordinary Americans, or small business owners. He didn t ask people in small towns and big cities. He asked big corporations what their opinions were. He sought advice from the same people he blasted as  The Swamp  during his campaign, and promised repeatedly to drain it.Now, given who he s appointed to his cabinet, it was pretty clear that he had zero intention of draining the swamp. Trump specifically targeted manufacturers and fossil fuel producers for this, probably because he thinks allowing them to run roughshod will at least help him pretend he s truly bringing manufacturing jobs back. But this is even more egregious because major industry insiders don t care about people. They don t care who they hurt in pursuit of the almighty dollar. Of course they want industry regulations cut   these are the industries people fought (and died) against to stop things like child labor and worker exploitation.The White House got 168 comments total. Manufacturers went after the EPA the hardest, with 79 of those comments targeting that agency. The EPA received 79 comments total, because of course it did. And companies targeted the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts with 48 and 29 comments respectively, because having to clean up after yourself so everyone around you can breathe clean air and drink clean water is just too difficult.Trump s decision to halt key provisions of the Clean Water Act has already angered people, particularly those living in communities that are especially vulnerable to poisoned water. The director of the Sierra Club s  Beyond Coal  campaign has said: Trump s attempt to halt these clean water protections for mercury, lead, and arsenic from coal power plants is dangerous and irresponsible. After years of peer-reviewed studies, extensive input from medical experts and scientists, and thorough review of public comments, the EPA made the right call in finalizing strong clean water protections against coal plants dumping toxic heavy metals into our waterways As a mother, I m frankly horrified that the EPA would put the safety of drinking water at risk for millions of Americans, but that s exactly what they ve done. Coming from West Virginia, where we ve had enormous challenges with maintaining clean water supplies due to the coal industry s political influence, I m outraged that these common sense protections are under attack from the EPA itself. But, well, profit is king here, even though the coal industry is never going to recover no matter what Trump tries to do. A full breakdown of the agencies and regulations that these companies would like to see rolled back, if not outright eliminated, is below:BP says it wants to make it easier to drill for gas and oil in the very same Gulf that was devastated in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, because why force them be careful when they can lie about being able to self-regulate? (Big corporations can t self-regulate.) And The Associated General Contractors of America wants to roll back regulations for paid sick leave for government contractors. They probably want to get rid of overtime rules, too.Of course, business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are applauding Trump for this. They see this administration as one that is finally interested in relieving businesses  from a regulatory onslaught that occurred, principally, during the prior administration. Others are not so sure this is the best way to do things, though, because companies will always, always, always act in their own best interests, and damn the rest of the world. Jeffrey Zients, who worked on regulatory issues under Obama, said: At a time when many CEOS are focused on the short term and looking to maximize their profitability each quarter, I believe that a lot of their aversion to these regulations reflects a short-term mind-set that values reducing costs over anything else.That s unfortunate, because well-crafted regulations are an important part of creating sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run. A detail. These companies don t want sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run. They want unfair and profitable in the short run. It s the nature of the beast. And it s why the business world needs strong regulation. Instead, Trump is trying to give them back the ability to do what they want, when they want, how they want, without regard to the harm they cause.Featured image by Ron Sachs   Pool via Getty Images',\n",

       " '(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday his administration wants more rigorous screening of refugees and visitors from certain countries to prevent terrorist attacks. Here is what Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s order on â\\x80\\x9cextreme vettingâ\\x80\\x9d - denounced by civil rights groups as discriminatory - includes. The order bars the entry of foreign nationals from certain countries for 90 days. While no countries are specifically named in the order, it refers to a statute that would apply to seven Muslim-majority nations: Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Iraq. There is an exception for certain types of visas, including for diplomats and the United Nations. The temporary halt is aimed at giving the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and the Director of National Intelligence time to determine what information is needed from each country to ensure that visas are not issued to individuals posing a national security threat. The order calls for a review to create a single process for screening people entering the country, which could include holding more in-person interviews, searches of an expanded database of identity documents or longer application forms.  Under the current system, some visa applications require interviews but others do not. The government already has extensive databases but some believe they need to be expanded. Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0The order suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows consular officers to exempt some applicants from face-to-face interviews if they are seeking to renew their temporary visas within a year of expiration. Immigration attorneys say the changes will make even routine applications much more complicated and time consuming and could mean that more people will need assistance to get through the visa process. In an attempt to ensure wait times for interviews are â\\x80\\x9cnot unduly affected,â\\x80\\x9d the order calls for the hiring of more consular fellows to work in U.S. embassies abroad.  The order calls for the temporary halt of all refugee admissions for four months so the government can study the process and determine if additional checks are necessary, although there will be case-by-case exceptions. The orderÂ\\xa0also implemented a blanket ban of all Syrian refugees until â\\x80\\x9csufficient changesâ\\x80\\x9d have been made to the refugee program, without giving more details. After the suspension is lifted, the government will give priority to applicants that are suffering religious-based prosecution, but only if they are minorities in their country. Trump said in a television interview that the move would protect Christians. It could also protect ethnic minorities like the Yazidis in the Middle East. This could potentially open the door to legal challenges claiming religious discrimination, some legal experts say. Once refugee admissions resume, fewer will be allowed. The 2017 cap was set at 50,000 people, compared to 85,000 designated by President Barack Obama for 2016. In a nod to certain states and cities that have objected to refugee resettlement, the order also seeks to give state and local jurisdictions a role in deciding whether or not to allow people to live there. COMPLETING THE â\\x80\\x9cBIOMETRIC ENTRY-EXIT TRACKING SYSTEMâ\\x80\\x9d The system is aimed at tracking foreign visitorsâ\\x80\\x99 arrival and departure using information like finger prints. Former President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s administration had aimed to start implementing biometric exit checks at the countryâ\\x80\\x99s largest airports byÂ\\xa02018. Some experts have said that for the system to work properly, it would need to cover all land, air, and sea ports of entry, which is a major undertaking. According to a 2014 report from the Bipartisan Policy Center the system would be expensive to implement and would â\\x80\\x9coffer mixed value for enforcement objectives.â\\x80\\x9d (This version of the story has been refiled to fix spelling of â\\x80\\x9cIraqâ\\x80\\x9d in paragraph 3) ',\n",
       " 'What is the price of one s dignity? Florida Senator Marco Rubio recently found himself wrestling with that question and came up with the answer  I d exchange it for nothing, just as long as I get 15 more minutes in the spotlight.  Donald Trump obliged.Having just months ago described Trump as a small dick lunatic con artist (remember how insane the Republican primary was?), Rubio knelt down and kissed the ring this week. On Twitter, he officially endorsed Trump in the most roundabout way possible:In Florida only 2 legitimate candidates on ballot in Nov. I wont vote for Clinton & I after years of asking people to vote I wont abstain.  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) May 27, 2016Rubio s the kind of spineless politician who won t abstain from voting for Trump, a guy whose rallies he once colorfully described as  a frightening, grotesque, and disturbing development in American politics.  He s voting for that guy.The day before, Rubio said he would give Trump a more ringing endorsement if he let him speak at the Republican National Convention this summer. At one point, Rubio was poised to be the Republican nominee, now he s reduced to begging Trump to let him share the same stage.Apart from the promise of a few  Rubio endorses Trump  headlines, it s baffling to think of why Rubio decided to sell out, and so quickly. The Washington Examiner, a right-wing publication no less, blasted Rubio for his shamelessness.It s one thing to begrudgingly argue that as dangerous as he thinks a Trump presidency would be, that he thinks a Clinton presidency would be even worse. But to actually say that he would be  honored  by the chance to speak on Trump s behalf at the GOP convention, and to downplay his previously stated problems with Trump as mere  policy differences,  is to prove the Rubio skeptics right.That is, far from being an inspirational moral leader, Rubio has shown himself to be more of an opportunistic politician with his finger to the wind.The major problem: Supporting Trump is almost sure to backfire. In the aftermath of the nuclear meltdown coming in November, those closest to Trump are going to be fatally radioactive. In Chernobyl they were referred to as the  walking ghosts,  already doomed but still alive. In November, they ll just be called  Trump s supporters.  Rubio, who is retiring from the Senate at the end of his term (he hardly bothered to work there anyway), is reportedly having second thoughts. He may see throwing himself at the feet of Trump as one way to get his hat back in the ring if he decides to run again.It s a bad miscalculation. Trump may seem popular to the guy who just got absolutely smoked by him in the primary, but the American people still actively loathe Trump. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie learned that lesson the hard way. Already unpopular, a recent poll found that after he announced he would be serving as Trump s campaign jester, a whopping 49 percent of New Jersey voters said they  dislike everything about Gov. Christie.  As polling questions go, that s about the sickest burn imaginable.The internet was quick to reminder Rubio of the fate he just chose for himself.@marcorubio so you\\'ll vote for a guy you called a con artist.

       " ' The Vision Thing\\nBy Paul Edwards\\nThat this election is an abysmal disgrace is nationally acknowledged; that it is absolutely unique is not, although itÂ\\x92s undeniable. Never before has virtually the entire mainstream media avidly, emphatically endorsed one Presidential candidate while furiously, contemptuously vilifying the other. Never has a sitting President joined in general denunciation of a candidate. With ten days to go itÂ\\x92s affirmed by most key sources that Donald Trump canÂ\\x92t win and Hillary Clinton will. Many pundits predict a landslide for her. Assume it. What then? The most hated President-elect ever will not be loved by the Congress she will confront. Even with a majority in the Senate--just possible--and in the House--not--prospects for a legislative agenda, should she have one, are non-existent. What ObamaÂ\\x92s phony charm failed to achieve, HillaryÂ\\x92s lack of it will scarcely obtain. This presages four more years of stasis and nullity, of social and economic rot, financial chicanery, and national decay. As regards the composition of the Supreme Court--the panicky Liberal pitch for being Â\\x93with herÂ\\x94--unless she nominates hidebound conservatives, which is probable, not a single selection will be confirmed during her term. So... paralysis in Congress, reaction in the Court; two limbs of government neutralized, gives us rule by a disliked, distrusted figurehead with the full power of Wall Street and the Imperial War-loving Establishment behind her. What then will be accomplished? First, the interests of The Empire will be promoted at least as robustly as in ObamaÂ\\x92s eight years of sycophancy. Including his Rube Goldbergian Obamacare, still foundering and gouging, nothing of any benefit to Americans was achieved under this charlatan who perfected the skill of describing an airplane crash as a triumph of gravity. So what will she do in office? Well, start with what she wonÂ\\x92t do. She wonÂ\\x92t make any effort to restrain The Big Casino, the Gold Sacks Mafia. They made her an offer she couldnÂ\\x92t refuse. She wonÂ\\x92t attempt any closing of the inequality gap. That would entail clipping her base--Â\\x94Our CrowdÂ\\x94 of the Hamptons, Palm Beach and Beverly Hills. She wonÂ\\x92t meddle with Sick Care--Â\\x94fool me once...Â\\x94--or, corporate tax enforcement. Her Big Donors donÂ\\x92t want to pay them and why should they, right? She can just let Labor die of its own raging leukemia. College grads have to stay in their parentsÂ\\x92 basements and service their college debt via Macdonalds because Arbeit Macht Frei. No need to do anything about Global Warming so long as you denounce it boldly at international meetings. Best leave the environment in the hands of those who can turn idle nature into money. Besides, the solution to pollution is dilution and clearcuts grow back in a millenium or so. On the minor agenda, she knows there are still small poor countries who require our R2P and cluster bombs. Others have resources that, with the odd military coup or assassination, should come on line nicely. Africa, say, has low-hanging fruit, and the Latin American mess needs our firm hand to prevent Lefty dictators diverting perfectly good profits to their own societies. Turning to the major crises, Exceptionalism requires that they be made far bigger. Our Defense Industries canÂ\\x92t be expected to muck along forever on paltry brushfire wars: Iraq, Afghanistan--though in fairness theyÂ\\x92ve profuced steady income streams--and Libya, no bonanza, and Syria, which PutinÂ\\x92s diabolical meddling prevented blossoming as we hoped. Still, thereÂ\\x92s no earthly reason we canÂ\\x92t achieve a profitable Third World War simply by refusing to take the bait of Satanic PutinÂ\\x92s wimpy peace offers and calling them what they really are: a mortal threat to our Capitalist System. So much for her first Hundred Days. Beyond the panicked cheerleading of the Imperial Elite--those that the late, great George Carlin referred to as Â\\x93your ownersÂ\\x94--and their failing organs of crowd manipulation, and beyond the day Clinton takes office if their hopes are consummated, America faces a cataclysmic crisis of governance; one of the order of magnitude of the secession of The South under Lincoln. Clinton and Trump are the physical, mental and emotional symptoms of that crisis. Our dead system must, and will, have catharsis. Which of them precipitates it may not greatly matter. Or it may mean everything.

It was not clear who, exactly, was behind the attack, or which group was responsible.Trump waited until the dust settled and condemned both sides, as both sides warrant condemnation in this situation: from the white supremacists to the black supremacists, to the Communists, to Antifa, the situation was hardly one-sided.David Duke attempted to link Trump to the bigotry and hatred that was present in Charlottesville, however, it would be a far cry to say that the President is in any way happy with or affiliated with Duke or those he associates with, and to say so is to insult the President and his supporters.However, President Trump, back when he was dropping out of the Reform Party primary in 2000, condemned David Duke.When pressed by Matt Lauer on why he saw the Reform Party as self-destructing, Trump commented: Well, you ve got David Duke just joined, a bigot, a racist, a problem, I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party.

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney scored a victory that had eluded more than 40 U.S. public officials who took on the powerful U.S. soda industry when the city council voted on Thursday to slap a tax on sweetened drinks.  After a bitter, months-long battle, the city council voted 13-4 to approve a 1.5 cent-per-ounce tax on sugary and diet drinks beginning in January. The council already approved the plan in a preliminary vote last week, and the outcome had not been expected to change.  The City of Brotherly Love became the biggest U.S. city to have such a tax. Much smaller Berkeley, California, was the first. Similar efforts, including several spearheaded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, were defeated after intense lobbying from organizations like the American Beverage Association, which opposes the Philadelphia move and represents Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc.  Following Thursdayâ\\x80\\x99s vote, the ABA said it would take legal action to stop the tax.  The Philadelphia vote marked a major victory for health advocates who say sugary drinks cause obesity and diabetes. But experts noted those concerns were not the focus for Kenney and other backers of the tax as they took on critics complaining that â\\x80\\x9cnanny stateâ\\x80\\x9d public health measures intrude on residentsâ\\x80\\x99 personal lives. Instead, Kenney rewrote the soda-tax advocateâ\\x80\\x99s playbook. He played up the benefits of the cash injection from the tax for the cityâ\\x80\\x99s depleted coffers. In the first year, the tax is projected to raise $91 million, and he pledged to spend funds on public programs such as universal pre-kindergarten. â\\x80\\x9cIf you want to tax something and people know where the moneyâ\\x80\\x99s going to go, then itâ\\x80\\x99s easier for them to get behind it,â\\x80\\x9d Kenney said in an interview. He noted that focusing on revenue, rather than health, was largely responsible for the measureâ\\x80\\x99s passage.  The strategic shift could lend momentum to movements in San Francisco, neighboring Oakland, California, and Boulder, Colorado. Residents of those cities will vote in November on similar taxes, which could deal further blows to a U.S. soft drink industry already hit by declining soda consumption. U.S. soda consumption fell for the 11th straight year in 2015, according to Euromonitor data.  Bloomberg made public health a centerpiece of his tenure as New York City mayor between 2002 and 2013. He moved to limit smoking in parks and restaurants, ban transfats and require calorie counts posted in some restaurants. On soda, he pushed for a tax, then a ban on soda purchases with food stamps, and finally a much-lampooned limit on the size of sugary drinks. His efforts were ultimately rejected, with critics decrying the moves toward a â\\x80\\x9cnanny state.â\\x80\\x9d  The strategy worked in Britain, where a new soft drinks levy was announced in March after officials emphasized the countryâ\\x80\\x99s obesity crisis, saying it cost the economy billions of pounds annually and was a huge burden on the state-funded health system.  That approach never worked in Philadelphia. Michael Nutter, the previous mayor, twice tried to pass a soda tax as a health initiative and as a way to plug a budget shortfall. He was unable to push it through the city council. â\\x80\\x9cTwice before it was used in Philadelphia and it was not successful. It was used in New York and it was not effective,â\\x80\\x9d said Kenney, adding that while the health benefits of a tax are not â\\x80\\x9cless important,â\\x80\\x9d they are less tangible.  Kenney, who became mayor in January, had made a campaign pledge to provide universal pre-kindergarten, and he kept that issue as his focus. A spokeswoman said complex state laws on taxation made enacting a citywide soda tax the best option to raise revenue for that signature proposal. Bloomberg personally contributed funding to support Philadelphiaâ\\x80\\x99s pro-tax campaigners.  Opponents of Philadelphiaâ\\x80\\x99s soda tax argued that the measure will disproportionately hurt the poor and prompt Philadelphians to travel to nearby suburbs to buy soda.  A spokesman for No Philly Grocery Tax, a local ABA-funded group, said it would sue the city to stop it from imposing the â\\x80\\x9cunconstitutionalâ\\x80\\x9d tax, but was still analyzing all its legal options. In a statement, it called the tax â\\x80\\x9cregressive and discriminatory.â\\x80\\x9d  Kenney said the city was prepared to defend the tax in any litigation from the beverage industry.  â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the precedent that they were so staunchly fighting, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s their problem now,â\\x80\\x9d Kenney said. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re going to see the beginnings of a kind of domino effect relative to this specific effort.â\\x80\\x9d  In Colorado, Boulder hopes to use soda tax revenue on health programs, and San Francisco and Oakland officials would recommend but not require funds raised to go toward obesity and diabetes prevention.  When Berkeley passed its soda tax in 2014, industry groups dismissed the measure as a fluke given the cityâ\\x80\\x99s largely white population and reputation as a hotbed for liberal measures. But Philadelphia is the fifth-largest U.S. city, with 1.6 million people. â\\x80\\x9cNo one can trivialize it as they can trivialize Berkeley,â\\x80\\x9d said Larry Tramutola, a California political strategist who worked on the Berkeley campaign and is currently leading the San Francisco and Oakland efforts.

       " 'Some people may have recently heard of the many benefits of choosing a Paleo diet and may be wondering what this regime entails. Is this a new fad diet that is heavy on promises and low on results, or is it something that deserves to be thoroughly looked into? Today we are going to address some of the best aspects of a Paleo Diet as well as cover some of the foods that are to avoided.\\nBest Aspects of the Paleo Diet: Fish: To begin with, this diet is a good choice for those who savor seafood. This dietary regimen allows for the consumption of these foods. According to Dr. Cordainâ\\x80\\x99s work, salmon, halibut, and more types of seafood are even encouraged. This can offer the benefits of healthy Omega 3 fatty acids.\\nHowever, there are many medical researchers, such as Dr. Helen Caldicott, that strongly suggest people avoid seafood and the consumption of seaweed dishes, from the Pacific Ocean, due to the ongoing Fukushima disaster. This is a problem that should also be known by those who enjoy cheeses and mushrooms since they both tend to absorb harmful amounts of radiation.\\nMeats: Grass produced meats are permitted. The Paleo Diet suggests meats are best in moderation. The same applies to other sources of protein, such as seeds, nuts, and eggs.\\nMany people find this variety of choices is what makes the Paleo Diet superior to many other weight-loss options. This is because a majority of the most common food cravings can be halted with the correct use of these permitted foods. While other healthy diets and eating options tend to revolve around a combination of prudent choices and a strong willpower to succeed, the Paleo Diet is viewed, by many, as one of the least restrictive weight-loss and management options. The variety of foods permitted makes it far easier to stick to an eating regimen, which can lead to positive results in both health and appearance.\\nFoods to Avoid: There are certain foods that are to be avoided on the Paleo Diet. These food choices include certain grains, refined sugar, dairy, and perhaps the hardest of all, for some, salt. There are some salt substitutes that are healthier and that taste the same as salt, therefore, this hurdle can easily be overcome. One such substitute is called, â\\x80\\x9cNo Salt,â\\x80\\x9d which many proclaim tastes so much like regular salt, it is indistinguishable. Perhaps the most quirky thing, due to the makeup of the peanut, is that while nuts are allowed on the diet, peanuts are not allowed.\\nBefore choosing any diet, it is a good idea to consult a doctor first, with that in mind, the Paleo Diet is certainly a health choice that should be considered and is worth researching. This is particularly true regarding those that have experimented with a variety of diets, in the past. There are people who may have given up on their weight-loss journey, due to the experience of food cravings that were unable to be met. This is the leading cause of diet failure in America today and the Paleo Diet is becoming quite popular due to the elimination of this hurdle.\\nBy Samuel Di Gangi\\nEdited by Jeanette Smith\\nSources:\\nThe Paleo Diet: what to eat on the paleo diet\\nIndependent Australia: educating Australians about Fukushimaâ\\x80\\x99s implications Dr. Helen Caldicott\\nEducating Australia\\nImage Courtesy of Adam Plotrowskiâ\\x80\\x99s Flickr Page â\\x80\\x93 Creative Commons License diet , paleo , weight-loss',\n",

Taking full advantage of this last opportunity to appeal to voters, the president gave his final plea to Americans before they choose his successor. I know it s been a long campaign. There s been a lot of noise, and a lot of distraction,  he said. At times, it s felt more like a reality show, or even a parody,  Obama continued.  But tomorrow, tomorrow, Philadelphia, the choice you face when you step into that voting booth could not be clearer and could not be more serious. Obama explained that Trump is completely and totally unqualified to serve as president.  Don t take my word for it, listen to the Republicans who refuse to support him,  the president said.  He lacks a basic understanding of the world. The commander in chief joked again about Trump s aides revoking his Twitter privileges, but at the same time, he made a very good point. Over the weekend, his campaign took away his Twitter account because he s erratic,  Obama said.  If his closest advisors won t trust him to tweet, why would any of us trust him with the nuclear codes? Obama then gave one final endorsement of the Democratic nominee.  You don t have to just vote against someone, you have someone outstanding to vote for in Hillary Clinton,  Obama exclaimed. Hillary, he said, will do whatever it takes to deliver on her campaign promises and make life better for the American people.  She will work. She will deliver. She won t just tweet,  the president said.Watch President Obama s speech in its entirety, here:[ad3media campaign= 1325 ]Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An intense and sustained push by U.S. evangelicals helped drive President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and eventually relocate the U.S. embassy there, activists said on Wednesday.  While Trump had long pledged to move the embassy, the Republican president s conservative Christian advisers repeatedly pressed the case in regular meetings at the White House, the conservative activists said.  I have no doubt that evangelicals played a meaningful role in this decision,  said Johnnie Moore, a California pastor who serves as a spokesman for a council of leading evangelicals that advises the White House.  I don t believe it would have happened without them.  The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Many U.S. evangelicals have expressed strong solidarity with conservatives in Israel and feel a connection rooted in the Bible to the Jewish state.        Conservative Christians have long argued that formally recognizing Jerusalem, home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions, was long overdue following a 1995 congressional mandate to move the embassy from Tel Aviv. In Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, they found their most sympathetic audience. Activists  efforts included an email campaign launched by the group My Faith Votes. The group is chaired by Mike Huckabee, the former Republican presidential candidate and father of Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. The group posted a form on its website and urged people to contact the White House to press for recognition of Jerusalem as the capital. Another evangelical group, American Christian Leaders for Israel, which includes conservative activists Gary Bauer and Penny Nance, sent a letter to Trump warning that time was of the essence in moving the embassy. Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital was  criticized by Palestinian leaders and others in the international community, who fear it will spark unrest in the region. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. No other country has its embassy in Jerusalem.  In June, Trump, like Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama before him, signed a waiver delaying the embassy move to Jerusalem in the hope of boosting his nascent efforts at brokering a peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians. With a deadline approaching for another such waiver, evangelical advocates saw a window to increase the pressure. American Christian Leaders for Israel, in the letter to Trump posted on its website, said they were  gravely concerned that with every passing day it will become more difficult to move the embassy and if you do not do it now, it may never happen.  Trump first convened a circle of evangelical advisers during his presidential campaign, and he was the overwhelming favorite of white evangelical voters in last year s election.     Moore, a member of the evangelical group advising the administration, said a prominent Christian conservative was in the White House just about every day. Much of the access comes through the Office of Public Liaison and its deputy director, Jennifer Korn, whose portfolio includes faith groups.  I ve sat in many meetings with evangelicals in the White House since the administration began, and I can tell you this issue came up again and again and again,  Moore said. He said evangelicals made it clear to the White House that it was a priority of theirs and they wanted action soon. Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University and a close Trump adviser, said he had never talked to the president about the issue but had received emails from other leading evangelicals in the past several days  asking me to support this or tweet that, and try to get the word out.   The faith community has talked to the administration for months and months about the need to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,  said Robert Jeffress, pastor at First Baptist Church in Dallas and an evangelical adviser to Trump.  But the fact is, we didn t have to do any convincing of this administration. This was a campaign promise that President Trump was happy to keep because he feels that way,  Jeffress said in a telephone interview with Reuters on Wednesday.  ',\n",

       " 'World wildlife â\\x80\\x98falls by 58% in 40 yearsâ\\x80\\x99 10/27/2016 \\nBBC NEWS Global wildlife populations have fallen by 58% since 1970, a report says. \\nThe Living Planet assessment, by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and WWF, suggests that if the trend continues that decline could reach two-thirds among vertebrates by 2020. \\nThe figures suggest that animals living in lakes, rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses. \\nHuman activity, including habitat loss, wildlife trade, pollution and climate change contributed to the declines. \\nDr Mike Barrett. head of science and policy at WWF, said: â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s pretty clear under â\\x80\\x98business as usualâ\\x80\\x99 we will see continued declines in these wildlife populations. But I think now weâ\\x80\\x99ve reached a point where there isnâ\\x80\\x99t really any excuse to let this carry on. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations â\\x80\\x93 it really is now down to us to act.â\\x80\\x9d \\nHowever the methodology of the report has been criticised. Image copyright CARLOS DREWS / WWF Image caption The report looked at data collected on 3,700 species of vertebrates over the last 40 years \\nThe Living Planet Report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s wildlife. \\nFor freshwater species alone, the decline stands at 81% since 1970 Dr Mike Barrett, WWF \\nThis analysis looked at 3,700 different species of birds, fish, mammals, amphibians and reptiles â\\x80\\x93 about 6% of the total number of vertebrate species in the world. \\nThe team collected data from peer-reviewed studies, government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and NGOs. \\nAny species with population data going back to 1970, with two or more time points (to show trends) was included in the study. \\nThe researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time. \\nSome of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data (there are many records on Arctic and near Arctic birds, for example) or very little data (tropical amphibians, for example). The report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture. \\nThe last report, published in 2014, estimated that the worldâ\\x80\\x99s wildlife populations had halved over the last 40 years. \\nThis assessment suggests that the trend has continued: since 1970, populations have declined by an average of 58%. \\nDr Barrett said some groups of animals had fared worse than others. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment â\\x80\\x93 for freshwater species alone, the decline stands at 81% since 1970. This is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems, and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building, for example.â\\x80\\x9d \\nIt also highlighted other species, such as African elephants , which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching, and sharks, which are threatened by overfishing. \\nIf pressures â\\x80\\x93 overexploitation, illegal wildlife trade for example â\\x80\\x93 increase or worsen, then that trend may be worse Dr Robin Freeman, ZSL \\nThe researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of 2% each year, and warn that if nothing is done, wildlife populations could fall by 67% (below 1970 levels) by the end of the decade. \\nDr Robin Freeman, head of ZSLâ\\x80\\x99s Indicators & Assessments Unit, said: â\\x80\\x9cBut thatâ\\x80\\x99s assuming things continue as we expect. If pressures â\\x80\\x93 overexploitation, illegal wildlife trade, for example â\\x80\\x93 increase or worsen, then that trend may be worse. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut one of the things I think is most important about these stats, these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations â\\x80\\x93 they are not extinctions. By and large they are not vanishing, and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it.â\\x80\\x9d Image copyright SCOTT DICKERSON Image caption There are still many gaps in our knowledge of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s vertebrates \\nHowever, Living Planet reports have drawn some criticisms. \\nThere are some numbers [in the report] that are sensible, but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy Stuart Pimm, Duke University \\nStuart Pimm, professor of conservation ecology at Duke University in the United States, said that while wildlife was in decline, there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are some numbers [in the report] that are sensible, but there are some numbers that are very, very sketchy,â\\x80\\x9d he told BBC News. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor example, if you look at where the data comes from, not surprisingly, it is massively skewed towards western Europe. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen you go elsewhere, not only do the data become far fewer, but in practice they become much, much sketchierâ\\x80¦ there is almost nothing from South America, from tropical Africa, there is not much from the tropics, period. Any time you are trying to mix stuff like that, it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single numberâ\\x80¦. Itâ\\x80\\x99s flawed.â\\x80\\x9d \\nBut Dr Freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s completely true that in some regions and in some groups, like tropical amphibians for example, we do have a lack of data. But thatâ\\x80\\x99s because there is a lack of data. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s entirely possible that species that arenâ\\x80\\x99t being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse â\\x80\\x93 but Iâ\\x80\\x99d be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed. â\\x80\\x9c',\n",
       " 'Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced who he has selected to take on crafting the Senate version of the House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA), but Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) is having none of it and blasted McConnell for not putting any of the female senators in the group.Feinstein expressed her extreme displeasure with the decision to exclude women from this important panel on Meet the Press. She told Andrea Mitchell, I don t know what the 13 white men, when you have five Republican women who are excluded from that, that these 13 men are supposed to sit down and put something together. One main problem with leaving women off of this key panel is that as passed by the House, the ACHA drastically changed the way pre-existing conditions are treated. Under the Affordable Care Act, premiums could not be raised nor could coverage be denied to people with pre-existing health issues. While many of these problems can affect men and women, such as depression and acne, some only apply to women. For example, pregnancy and problems with menstruation can be considered pre-existing conditions under the House bill.Feinstein noted that women s health care has to be considered when they draft the Senate bill. As for responses to the House bill, The American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and the National Physicians Alliance have all come out against the ACHA.  Feinstein added, Women s health is a big part of this, and women are a majority of the population and their health interests deserve to be contemplated in any reform. I m really very worried that in the rush to judgment, we create a major healthcare problem for people. And we lose a lot of jobs in so doing and we create a whole atmosphere of unpredictability. For an idea of what they may now consider pre-existing conditions, this is just the short list of what might force someone to pay more under Trump s plan, as passed by the House. By making it legal to charge people more for having these problems, they may not be officially barring them from getting insurance but they will make it too expensive for people to afford it.This list is not complete, but you get the gist. Barring women from any discussions relating to this new draft for the Senate is absolutely absurd and it s just one more reason why we have to keep resisting   they can t be allowed to pass this bill without every voice being heard. Call your senators now before it s too late!Featured image via Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.',\n",

       " 'LONDON  â\\x80\\x94   One way or another, Britain will have its second female prime minister. The governing Conservative Party took another step on Thursday in its process to replace Prime Minister David Cameron, winnowing the contest to two candidates: Theresa May, the home secretary, and Andrea Leadsom, the junior energy minister. When the contest is concluded in September, one of them will become the first woman to lead Britain since Margaret Thatcher, also a Conservative, stepped down in 1990. The winner will take over as Britain grapples with how to carry through with its stunning decision last month to withdraw from the European Union, a choice that Mr. Cameron opposed and that led him to announce he would step aside once the party chose a successor. Ms. May quietly supported remaining in the European Union but has since said that she respects the outcome of the June 23 referendum and that she will seek the best possible deal for Britain as it negotiates its withdrawal from the bloc. She dominated the first stage of the selection process, in which the field is narrowed to two candidates through voting by the 330 Conservative members of the House of Commons. Ms. May, 59, remains the favorite, but in the next round will be judged by a different constituency: registered party members, many of whom were vociferous supporters of leaving the European Union. Conservative Party headquarters has for days been unable or unwilling to disclose how many registered voters there are, but the House of Commons Library said that the latest published figure of 149, 800 stems from December 2013. Voters will mail in their ballots, with the winner, to be announced on Sept. 9, becoming party leader and prime minister without having to call a general election. Ms. Leadsom, 53, the   in Thursdayâ\\x80\\x99s round of voting by members of Parliament, was a vocal advocate of leaving the European Union. In finishing second and qualifying for the final round, she eliminated Michael Gove, the justice secretary, who helped lead the Leave campaign. Mr. Gove had announced his candidacy just before the deadline last week, and in doing so torpedoed the hopes of his partner in the Leave campaign, Boris Johnson, the former London mayor, to succeed Mr. Cameron. Ms. May holds one of the   posts in the British government and is considered the more experienced candidate  â\\x80\\x94   serious and competent but lacking charisma. Ms. Leadsom, who had a low profile and entered government as a junior minister only in 2014, has been accused of inflating her rÃ©sumÃ©. As recently as three years ago, she supported continued British membership in the European Union. Ms. Leadsom put her 25 years of working in financial services before becoming a legislator in 2010 at the center of her leadership campaign, but those who worked with her have told reporters that she exaggerated her role at Barclays Bank and Invesco Perpetual, a fund manager. She told Sky News, â\\x80\\x9cMy CV is correct. â\\x80\\x9d In Thursdayâ\\x80\\x99s voting, Ms. May received 199 votes, Ms. Leadsom 84 and Mr. Gove 46. Ms. May and Ms. Leadsom are both ideological conservatives whose backgrounds are far different from those of the   male circle that has dominated Conservative politics since Mr. Cameron became party leader in 2005. Both women went to state schools, where Ms. May won a place at Oxford. Ms. Leadsom went to the University of Warwick. Ms. May said on Twitter that she was gratified by support from across the Conservative Party, including both people who favored membership in the European Union and those against it. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve always said there should be a proper contest. Now is the time for me and my team to take our case out to members in the country,â\\x80\\x9d she wrote. â\\x80\\x9cWe need proven leadership to negotiate the best deal as we leave the E. U. unite our party, and build a country that works for everyone. â\\x80\\x9d In a speech on Thursday, Ms. Leadsom said she would focus on â\\x80\\x9cthe continued success of the U. K. economy,â\\x80\\x9d which has been hit hard by Brexit, raising fears of an increased budget deficit from lower growth and lower tax receipts. â\\x80\\x9cProsperity should be our goal, not austerity,â\\x80\\x9d she said. She also said that â\\x80\\x9ctrade must be our top priority: continued free trade with the E. U. â\\x80\\x9d She added that she favored â\\x80\\x9cfair but controlled immigration,â\\x80\\x9d without explaining how   trade with the European Union could be maintained while scrapping European rules on freedom of movement and labor, which she also has said she intends to do. European Union leaders have repeatedly said that access to the single market of the European Union is not possible without accepting freedom of movement and labor. Ms. Leadsom had initially agreed to back Mr. Johnson in return for the promise of a high government post. He was supposed to call or text her confirming their arrangement by a certain time, but failed to do so, prompting Ms. Leadsom to announce her own surprise candidacy. Simon Jenkins, writing in The Guardian, defended Brexit as the instrument of a great clearing out of a stagnant British politics. â\\x80\\x9cIt has got rid of a prime minister and is about to get rid of a leader of the opposition,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote. â\\x80\\x9cIt will soon be rid of a chancellor of the Exchequer and a lord chancellor. It is also rid of two, if not four, Tory heirs apparent. â\\x80\\x9d Even more, Mr. Jenkins said, the Labour Party is in chaos and the Greens and the U. K. Independence Party have both lost their leaders. â\\x80\\x9cAn entire political class is on the way out. As Oscar Wilde said of the death of Little Nell, it would take a heart of stone not to laugh. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The rising popularity of New Zealand s Labour Party in hotly contested elections is making it less likely that the nationalist New Zealand First Party will play kingmaker, poll averages released on Friday show. The uncertainty over which combination of parties will decide the next government is worsening an already topsy-turvy election, previously seen as a slam dunk for the center-right National Party, which has ruled for almost a decade. Since taking over as leader last month, charismatic politician Jacinda Ardern has almost single-handedly changed the chances of her Labour Party at the Sept. 23 election.  When I go out and knock on doors...there is a feeling for change, there is,  Marama Fox, a leader of the M ori Party, said at a televised debate between leaders of smaller parties, referring to Labour s newfound popularity.  Fox s party, which campaigns for the rights of indigenous New Zealanders, could play a crucial role in determining the next government. Though it has been in a coalition with National for nine years, Fox said she could work with Labour. Support for newly invigorated Labour rose to 41.8 percent in opinion polls, nudging above the National Party s 41.1 percent, figures released by media showed. That put the center-left opposition party closer to being able to form a government with the Green Party, polling at around 5.4 percent, and the M ori Party, which posted support of about 1.2 percent.  Alternatively Labour could join forces with New Zealand First, which slipped to 7.9 percent and had previously been thought likely to determine which major party governed. Green Party leader James Shaw would not rule out a deal with New Zealand First, but expressed reluctance, as the party s outspoken leader would not commit to either National or Labour.  He s a bad date,  Shaw said of Peters  last-minute decision to skip the debate.  He s stood us up tonight... he s completely unreliable and you don t know which way he s going to go.  But if the Green Party fell further, sinking below the support threshold of 5 percent for seats in parliament, that would put New Zealand First in an even stronger position.  It is really unusual... it s all about which pieces land where,  said Grant Duncan, political analyst at Auckland University. Minor parties often have an outsize role in New Zealand s proportional representation system, in which a party, or combination of parties, needs 61 of Parliament s 120 members - usually about 48 percent of the vote - to form a government.

       " 'Interesting juxtaposition of the week: The AE show â\\x80\\x9cDuck Dynastyâ\\x80\\x9d announces that the current season will be its last, and Paul Horner, who creates fake news stories on the internet, tells The Washington Post: â\\x80\\x9cMy sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDuck Dynasty,â\\x80\\x9d the reality show about the Robertson family of Louisiana and its   business, became a spectacular hit for AE after its debut in March 2012, then a spectacular headache in late 2013 when Phil Robertson, the patriarch, made remarks in a GQ interview that were widely seen as offensive to gay people. At that point the show was averaging nine million viewers a week, an amazing number for a   reality series, but the controversy cost it cachet among some viewers, and ratings have fallen considerably since. Overexposure no doubt also played a role in the showâ\\x80\\x99s decline. Members of the clan became celebrities and started turning up all over the place, and the producers churned out too many episodes too quickly. Even viewers who still loved the Robertsons and their homespun antics may have been tiring of the whole premise. During Wednesday nightâ\\x80\\x99s Season 11 premiere, the family announced that the series would end with the finale in April. Donâ\\x80\\x99t bother making a joke about the Robertsons shelving the series so they could join Donald J. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s administration  â\\x80\\x94   social media was flooded with them by Thursday morning. Sure, that could happen  â\\x80\\x94   there are certainly enough Robertsons to fill every cabinet post, and Willie Robertson, the showâ\\x80\\x99s central figure, was a supporter of Mr. Trump  â\\x80\\x94   but this is more likely just an example of a TV show that has run out of gas. Not without leaving a legacy, however. The series helped solidify the idea that distinguishing between real and fake, truth and fabrication, isnâ\\x80\\x99t really important. I spent a day with the Robertsons in West Monroe, La. in the summer of 2012, between the showâ\\x80\\x99s first and second seasons. The series was still building momentum, but even at that early stage, the Robertsons readily acknowledged that their â\\x80\\x9creality showâ\\x80\\x9d wasnâ\\x80\\x99t real at all. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s hardly rare  â\\x80\\x94   most reality shows are staged or at least steered toward a preplanned result, of course. But the Robertsons were unusual in that they freely admitted it. â\\x80\\x9cGuided realityâ\\x80\\x9d is the phrase they used. The episodes didnâ\\x80\\x99t simply follow the Robertsons around in their daily lives the producers would often sketch out the parameters of a situation and have the family live it. What made the show work so well was that the Robertsons, fitting the Eastern eliteâ\\x80\\x99s image of hicks, were in fact savvy media manipulators, excellent improvisers and telegenic as heck. And they seemed to intuit that although many of the showâ\\x80\\x99s episodes were obvious setups, no one would care. â\\x80\\x9cDuck Dynastyâ\\x80\\x9d sensed that viewers would happily embrace the reality that they wanted, even if it was a manipulated or outright invented version of reality. And now, in 2016, we have seen this flexible definition of whatâ\\x80\\x99s real carry into the political arena. As Mr. Horner noted, fabricated news articles streamed into receptive minds through Facebook feeds and such were a worrisome phenomenon in the presidential election, and they continue to be. â\\x80\\x9cThe   era,â\\x80\\x9d itâ\\x80\\x99s being called. (Earlier this week, â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x9d was named Oxford Dictionariesâ\\x80\\x99 2016 international word of the year.) Politicians have only recently figured out how to exploit it. The Robertsons and other   dynasties have been doing it for years.',\n",

MH17 Ukraine Plane Crash: Additional Details Revealed (+Exclusive Photos from the Scene) Donate \\nSouthFront received this text in Russian via email. It reveals additional details about the MH17 shot down in Ukraine in 2014. SouthFront Team decided to translate it into English and publish at our website so that our readers acquire a more complete picture of events that took place on the ground directly after the incident. Photos below have never been pulished online until now. \\nThe text below is recorded by Aleksandr Netyosov . Heâ\\x80\\x99s a member of the Union of Journalists of Russia, chief department editor of the Military Herald of the South of Russia newspaper, author of dozens of military history publications, and a native of Donetsk. \\nThe events from more than two years ago, concerning the MH17 Boeing 77 that crashed on the territory of former Ukraine (currently the Donetsk Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s Republic) are now part of history. An investigation team from the Netherlands working on this case which has promised to publish the results of its investigation in October in the end made general statements in which, contrary to facts, the law enforcement from the â\\x80\\x9cland of tulipsâ\\x80\\x9d placed the responsibility for this crime on the Donbass militia and Russia. The author of this essay personally learned that the accusation is baseless when he spent a vacation in his home region, in the capital of the coal country, and now the capital of the DPR, the lovely city of Donetsk. \\nMy schoolmates who now occupy high DPR posts and who know about my journalism career, arranged for me to meet interesting people who, by dint of their service at the time, were the first to arrive at the Boeing crash and to carry out an inspection of the crash site which is necessary in such cases. I spent several days with Donetsk law enforcement who fulfilled their duties to the last, in spite of the fact that Ukraine all but abandoned its responsibilities and tried to use a variety of administrative and psychological measures to first delay the investigation and then to stop it altogether. This is a very telling indication of who was the beneficiary of all the noise concerning the â\\x80\\x9cRussian trailâ\\x80\\x9d in the MH17 tragedy that unfolded on July 17, 2014 in the skies above the villages of Grabovo and Rassypnoye, in the Shakhtyorsk district of the Donetsk Region of Ukraine. \\nThe internal political situation at the time appeared confused and even odd. The civil war on the Donbass was escalating, the first blood was already spilled, but in Donetsk Ukraineâ\\x80\\x99s law enforcement on the Donbass were still peacefully coexisting with the DPR which was making its baby steps. Until a bolt from the blue, in a very literal sense, which divided the professional lives of fellow servicemen from local law enforcement into a â\\x80\\x9cbeforeâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cafterâ\\x80\\x9d. Unfortunately, the work of Donetsk investigators who spent two days on the Boeing 777 crash site were not used by anybody. Which means this is the first attempt to bring their words and deeds to the attention of broad range of readers in order to cast light on events that took place more than two years ago. \\nPlease get acquainted: Senior Justice Councillor Aleksandr Vasilyevich Gavrilyako, DPR Prosecutor General Officeâ\\x80\\x99s department head, a high-grade professional with 32.5 years of flawless service under his belt, against whom the post-Maidan leaders of â\\x80\\x9csovereign Ukraineâ\\x80\\x9d launched a criminal charges for maintaining his professional integrity in a new political reality. During that time, Colonel of the Police Gavrilyakko was the head of the investigative department of the Makeevka Regional Office of Internal Affairs, and was considered one of the top investigative department heads in the entire Ukraine MVD. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s what he said: \\nâ\\x80\\x93 I learned of the Malaysian Boeing crash from TV news. I caught myself thinking that it might be good to inspect the site. When I was about to leave for duty, I got a phone call. It was from Aleksandr Vasilyevich Mostovoy, DPRâ\\x80\\x99s Internal Security Service head, who suggested that I take a group of investigators to conduct a site inspection. I asked him: why was I chosen? To which he responded that I was recommended as the best specialist. So I had to reply that as an active-duty Ukraine MVD officer, I canâ\\x80\\x99t make that decision on my own, I need sanction from higher authorities. \\nâ\\x80\\x93 Upon arriving at work, I received a directive from the director of the Main Directorate of Internal Affairs of the Donetsk Region MVD, Major General Pozhidayev, to assemble an investigative team and take it to the crash site. This directive was confirmed by Col. Goncharov, the head of the Investigative Directorate of the Donetsk Region Internal Affairs Directorate, whom I called shortly after receiving the directive to remind him that the site is outside of my official jurisdiction. â\\x80\\x9cThe locals will help youâ\\x80\\x9d, he encouraged. And I was permitted to assemble a team of whoever I chose, which included two people from each of the five Makeevka regional departments. Which made a total of 10, plus me and two investigators from Makeevka City Internal Affairs Directorate. I asked my higher-ups for expert support and received it. \\nOur group worked with four experts, including Bogdan Olegovich Maklakov and the head of the Donetsk Regional Medical Forensics Bureau, Dmitriy Anatolyevich Kalashnikov. \\nOn the morning of July 18, we were met by DPR Prosecutor General office representatives with two cars to take us to the site. Although at that time Ukraine prosecutorâ\\x80\\x99s office still function and DPR MVD entities were not yet formed. While in transit, I got a call from Col. Goncharov who wanted to learn where we were? â\\x80\\x9cWhere are you?â\\x80\\x9d he asked insistently. I, naturally, told him about the route we were taking, together with DPR colleagues, toward Rassypnoye and Grabovo to the crash site, where Ukraineâ\\x80\\x99s Emercom was already beginning to function. Goncharov then categorically ordered me to return, citing orders he received from Ukraine MVD not to inspect the crash site. Naturally, I refused, since I was in a vehicle that belonged to DPR colleagues. They even made a bit of fun at me, proposing I jump off from a moving vehicle. \\nI have to add that at that time there was an ongoing cadre reshuffle, with the regional MVD leadership in toto moving to Mariupol, with their direct subordinates, the law enforcement officers in Donetsk and Makeevka, continued to work as before. There was no sense of division into us and them, though there was some alienation in interpersonal relations. Upon arriving at the site, we were greeted by Emercom and local self-government who already had a basic idea of what happened. It turned out that the main wreckage mass, including the tail section, engines, wings, and most of the corpses were on the outskirts of Grabovo. They were scattered all over the field. \\nBut we, upon the request of local authorities, started with inspecting Rassypnoye and its surroundings where, according to the reports from inhabitants, there were corpses in the back yards and even on the streets. The cabin with remains of the crew was also found there. Therefore we quickly started to investigate in the village, and the surrounding fields only later. Even as we were resolving all manner of questions, including organizational ones, it was almost evening. Therefore I decided that, given the huge volume of work, to inspect corpses, of which there were 36 in the village, note where they were found, and enter them into protocol. I was taking into consideration the heat, the pouring rains, and the livestock, all of which were threatening to nullify our efforts. Moreover, I earlier discussed with Col. Goncharov and Col. Miroshnichenko, the head of Makeevka UVD, who ordered me to go to the crash site, various technical aspects of working on the site. \\nIn particular, this concerned obtaining a truck with a crane, a refrigerator for corpses, and a hangar to store aircraft remains so that they could be subsequently laid out. Particularly since we already knew what caused the crash, which meant a more thorough inspection of crash site in order to locate killing elements which could be inside the bodies of the passengers, the fuselage skin, or the topsoil, and to find traces of the explosives. In order to identify the munition which brought down the Boeing. \\nWe already had the sad experience of similar type of work, when we investigated crash sites of several airliners in the Donetsk Region though, to be sure, we experienced no outside interference in those cases. The most recent such crash took place in 2006, when a Tu-154 with 176 passengers flying from Anapa to St. Petersburg went down. Therefore the initial crash site inspection is crucial to any such investigation, because it contains all the clues to reconstructing the tragedy. \\nThe regional center assigned us a facility on the territory of a vehicle park in their jurisdiction, complete with vehicles and a crane. So we began inspecting the site. What we saw shocked us. In one house, a female corpse broke through the roof and was stuck in the ceiling tiles, though one leg broke off and landed directly on a bed. On another property, six sets of passenger remains landed on garden vegetables. The shattered pilot cabin crashed just outside the village. The remains of the crew were scattered nearby, and we recognized them by the remnants of their uniforms. Having placed our investigators throughout the site, I called Col. Goncharov. He did not even want to listen to me, demanding that I explain why I disobeyed his order to turn around and not to investigate the site. In response, I said literally the following: first of all, the group was traveling on a vehicle belonging to DPR Prosecutorâ\\x80\\x99s Office, secondly, how could I have done that in the presence of armed people, and moreover the inspection had already begun. \\nThen he demanded that I sabotage the investigation in any way possible and create delays. Naturally, I asked him why the confusion. One minute Iâ\\x80\\x99m ordered to go, and now Iâ\\x80\\x99m to return. So he explained that orders came from Kiev not to inspect anything, because the SBU will look into it. But he did allow me to carry away the 36 corpses found in Rassypnoye. \\nNaturally, we havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen any SBU people, ever, because they left Donetsk already in May. We, of course, packed up the found and labeled human remains and sent them to the morgue at the Kalinin regional clinic. At the last minute, we were brought the corpse of a child found somewhere in Grabovo. We sent it to the morgue with the others. Our activities were curtailed by that very same Goncharov who first approved of us visiting the site, and then categorically forbade to inspect it. Then everything became clear to me. If Ukraine were interested in investigating this case in which, according to the official Kiev version, both local militia and Russia were implicated, nobody would have held us up. Rather to the contrary, theyâ\\x80\\x99d be asking us to leave no stone unturned to find every last piece of evidence, monitoring my every move confident in my thoroughness and professional ability. We arrived at the local Emercom HQ, located in Grabovo, close to the evening. Naturally, I told DPR Prosecutorâ\\x80\\x99s Office about orders from higher up, but I responded in the affirmative to their question whether Iâ\\x80\\x99d continue, believing that the innocent victims of this tragedy ought to be collected and inspected, otherwise who would do it otherwise. After that, we departed. On Saturday morning of July 19, we returned to the site as if nothing had happened yesterday. While traveling, I once again got a call from Goncharov who wanted to know where I was, and then we engaged in verbal sparring. I told him point blank: fields are littered with corpses of innocent people, we canâ\\x80\\x99t just leave them, which weâ\\x80\\x99d do had we obeyed Kievâ\\x80\\x99s orders. â\\x80\\x9cIn that case, Aleksandr Vasilyevich, you have made your choice,â\\x80\\x9d he replied and ended the conversation. I never heard his voice again. \\nOur first find that day was part of fuselage skin, in which some penetrating objects left punctures, with edges bent inward. This suggested the penetrations were made from the outside. Upon our arrival in Rassypnoye, we continued inspecting the site, though we were immediately warned not to wander into the woodline unless necessary. Because of tripwire mines placed there by both warring parties. At that time, volunteers from among the miners came up to help, so that we could cover as much of the site as possible. It was then that 20 corpses were found in a wheatfield on the edge of Grabovo. But, as a rule, the corpses were scattered: one here, another or a few somewhere else. \\nIt was then that members of the OSCE mission, accompanied by Berkut troops and the deputy director of Donetsk Region MVD, Colonel Aleksey Aleksandrovich Dikiy, arrived. \\nI turned to Dikiy for help, because I did not have enough people to do everything necessary: inspecting, extracting, packaging and, most importantly, recording all these actions in the protocol. He connected me to Gen. Pozhidayev, who initially was surprised by my presence there contrary to orders. He silently listened to my arguments about Christian and human duties, but was curious to know where we were sending the bodies, and directed to send them to Kharkov instead of Donetsk. But he did not explain how to do that, given the ongoing fighting, particularly since cannon fire was drawing closer. After he learned of DPR officialsâ\\x80\\x99 presence, he hung up. But in any event a group of investigators from Shakhtyorsk, 4 total, came to help me. \\nIn a command tent I was shown an announcement on some Ukrainian site which stated that local Emercom workers and the Donetsk investigative group went over to the separatists, helping them hide the corpses. Nevertheless, all the remains found on July 19 were properly inspected, in accordance with all the relevant procedures, and sent to Kharkov. Subsequently we suspended our work on the insistence of our security force, because gunfire was clearly approaching our location. After that we went home, but ended up in Rassypnoye. In order to question the witnesses of Boeingâ\\x80\\x99s crash among the local inhabitants who were quite happy to see us. \\nBut it is the actions of the Ukrainian side that give reasons to wonder. First they approved the inspection, then forbade it. If the militias were involved in that, the situation would have looked very different. Itâ\\x80\\x99s no coincidence that two days later all law enforcement officials received orders, of which I did not know, to take back roads to Slavyansk. The majority obeyed, but some, mainly those born on the Donbass, stayed. \\nThe conclusion practically asks to be drawn, in accordance with the ancient â\\x80\\x9ccui bono?â\\x80\\x9d maxim. If one looks at who the beneficiary was, then it makes no sense for Russia to have instigated the shoot-down. Given the international situation, it drew no benefit from it. Rather to the contrary, the Russian side was the most interested one in a transparent investigation. But it was labeled the guilty party already on the next day by the Western media. There is likewise little to point at the militia. There are all kinds of people among them, certainly. But downing a Boeingâ\\x80\\x94pardon me, thatâ\\x80\\x99s a whole different ball game. Because they would have been labeled terrorists on the international level. Shooting down a plane flying at an altitude of 10km is beyond their ability even now, let alone two years ago when some of them were carrying hunting shotguns. Promoting hysteria aimed at Russia was very telling in itself. As usual, the guilty party usually yells â\\x80\\x9cstop thief!â\\x80\\x9d the loudest. But the whole story was very convenient for Ukraine and its sponsors. The Americans have long mastered similar provocations. Black rectangles were added to hide the graphic content \\nI canâ\\x80\\x99t even call the Dutch specialists, who picked up where we left off, proper investigators. To be honest, they picked all manner of rejects for this important task. It may be they were in law enforcement of some sort. But they are no specialists. I came to that conclusion for one simple reason. After their departure from the crash site, they left behind a lot that would have drawn attention of professional investigators. In such cases, not only the wreckage and corpses are transported away, but also a layer of topsoil underneath. The Dutch did not hing of the kind, having collected only big pieces and leaving the rest behind. They did not even ask anyone for help, considering the large territory on which the wreckage was scattered. Therefore the site inspection was done in an unprofessional manner by the Dutch. After their visit, the locals kept finding pieces from the plane.â\\x80\\x9d \\nThe next direct participant of the investigation is the director of the DPR Medical Forensics Bureau, Dmitriy Anatolyevich Kalashnikov. At the time, he led the same bureau, though at the time it was the Donetsk Regional Bureau. Some 27 departments scattered all over the region answered to him. Now there are only 13 left in DPR, the rest are on the territory controlled by Ukraine. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s what he said: \\nâ\\x80\\x9cI received the news of the crash on the evening of the same day from a worker at a local office, who lived in Rassypnoye. She saw everything with her own eyes. Itâ\\x80\\x99s then that I started to get ready to go to the site. I had some experience with such work, when a Tu-154 crashed in our region in 2006. Moreover, I had to deal with the victims of major accidents in coal mines. At times, there were 30-40, or even 80 corpses to examine. \\nWe worked around the clock, without breaks, due to the ongoing fighting. It took about a day and a half before a decision was made and coordinated with other agencies. The weather at that time was very humid: heat interspersed with showers, which also played its role. On the site, I worked jointly with criminal investigators. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t think it necessary to bring along my subordinates, who were busy themselves, therefore I went alone. I expressed my view at the Emercom field HQ on how I viewed my responsibilities. In order to thoroughly record all the finds, I proposed to divide the area of the crash into squares. For example, one spot with burn spots had dimensions of 200 by 200 meters. Quite a large area. \\nAnother such spot was near Rassypnoye, where the crew cabin was. We decided to go there first, record the location of everything, and start describing the corpses. Because the corpses were scattered among the village houses. These are old buildings, and human remains falling from great height literally broke through roofs. I numbered every square and labeled all the pieces of evidence, corpses, fragments, personal effects, naturally with coordinates. Human remains were described in a most detailed fashion, including such details as tattoos, jewelry, and other important visible characteristics. \\nMost of the corpses were found naked. It later led to the speculation that the Boeing was loaded with dead corpses. In actuality, the corpses fell from great height, and the air resistance stripped clothing off them, except for tight articles. For example, shorts, underwear, and watches. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why we found them that way. Practically without any visible injuriesâ\\x80\\x94few external injuries and heavy internal ones. It was a sign that the fall came from a great height, when the plane broke apart. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t affirm whether the plane was downed by an external or internal action, but everything suggests it broke up in midair. If one examines, by comparison, the crash of the Russian airliner, it fell like a leaf following engine failure. Which is why its crash site could fit in a single photo. The Tupolevâ\\x80\\x99s remains were all togehter and the corpses of 176 passengers were inside the cabin. But here everything was scattered over a big territory, which immediately prompted me to say the explosion took place at great height. During the inspection, as I went from one spot to another, I was told the crew remains were discovered. They were near Rassypnoye, together with pilot cabin wreckage which confirmed by theory it was an explosion (internal or external) at great height while the plane was over this village, causing the separation of pilotsâ\\x80\\x99 cabin from the rest of the plane. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I believe the blow happened near the cabin, which led to the further disintegration of the plane whose fragments were so widely scattered. At first I was surprised by the sheer amount of seemingly unrelated personal belongings from passenger baggage. And also by one corpse that clearly was not a member of the crew. But everything became clear after I studied the Boeing 777 design on the internet, and realized that the baggage compartment begins right under the pilotsâ\\x80\\x99 cabin. \\nCharacteristically, one of the pilots was tightly buckled into his seat. Which means he was not running around the cabin at the time of the explosion but was behind the controls. Several other crew bodies were next to him. We identified them by the remains of the uniforms still on their bodies. We discovered 37 corpses in Rassypnoye, all of which were sent to the Donetsk morgue. Out of that total, we inspected 27 sets of remains, before receiving an order to send all remains to the Kharkov morgue in a specially assigned refrigerator. I was leaving body inspection for later. Now I regret doing that. Because we would have definitely found pieces of shrapnel and all manner of other things that could have shed light on this tragedy. But who would have believed us then, or now for that matter. They would have said we planted the evidence. \\nIncidentally, nobody has said anything about evaluation of human remains in Netherlands. Apparently they have something to hide . But I can show photographs which clearly show penetrating punctures in the corpse of the crew member who was strapped into his seat. His uniform shirt looks like a sieve. Two months later we were visited by an international commission, 6 people total, interested in that question, which contained Dutch and Canadian specialists, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know who else. We provided them with all the collected materials and photographs. We donâ\\x80\\x99t understand why they are keeping quiet about it. Perhaps they contain evidence thatâ\\x80\\x99s inconvenient for the West. Even though we did not dissect the corpses for ethical reasons (most of the passengers were Muslim) as well as political ones (because they were foreigners), instead we performed an external inspection to ascertain external injuries. We had no right to act as we pleased. We were waiting. For someone from a diplomatic post, but nobody ever showed up. \\nDutch specialists appeared only a week after the crash, when all the corpses were in Kharkov. Morgues in Europe, including Netherlands, are much better equipped than ours. With the aid of x-ray machines, they could have easily discovered the multiple fractures or the metallic shrapnel inside human remains or inside airliner parts. But since the Dutch have so far not shown anything of the sort to the rest of the world, it seems that they have something to hide. Moreover, we took samples from all the corpses for future DNA analysis. The Dutch categorically refused to take them along, and I barely managed to force them to take them. I also insisted on a formal transfer of the remains. They did not want to sign any official papers.â\\x80\\x9d \\nThe general picture of the July 17, 2014 tragedy is completed by the words of the members of the investigative team headed by Col. Gavrilyako. They are now law enforcement officials at DPR. They are Evgeniy Anatolyevich Bazilskiy, Andrey Yuryevich Mozgunov, and Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Murvyov, currently still serving with Col. Gavrilyako, and Bogdan Olegovich Maklakov, currently the deputy director of the Criminology Scientific Research Center at the Main Directorate of Internal Affairs of Donetsk Region. \\nThey said they divided themselves into pairs and began to inspect the site with the help of the locals. They were following the routine procedure of entering everything into a protocol, including the human remains and aircraft fragments. It was a sad sight, many corpses looked terrible, but they were â\\x80\\x9cfresh.â\\x80\\x9d They began to smell the next day. On the first day, the Makeevka investigators were exclusively describing the found corpses. Punctures were found in the wing found at a farm near Grabovo, which looked like entry holes from shrapnel. Returning from a second working day, the investigators talked to the eyewitnesses in Rassypnoye. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s what they said into the protocol. First of all, they heard multiple aircraft. In one of the houses, its owners, husband and wife, said that they saw a Ukrainian fighter fall down, nose up, behind a forest on Ukraine-controlled territory. They even watched two pilots descend by parachute. \\nSimilar testimony was given by another inhabitant of Rassypnoye, a former soldier, who was even offended when he was being checked using leading questions. He even observed the explosion at the fighterâ\\x80\\x99s crash site. Though he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t confirm it, because the whole woodline was full of tripwire mines. But hereâ\\x80\\x99s the most important thing: several witnesses heard the sound coming from another plane which circled for some time above the crash site of its colleague, then flew toward Debaltsevo. It couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be seen due to the low clouds. But it could be heard. This testimony was, naturally, entered into the protocol. And they are kept in DPR Prosecutorâ\\x80\\x99s Office archives. So the mystery of the Malaysian Boeingâ\\x80\\x99s death on July 17, 2014, is still awaiting its day. Without any doubt, the facts discovered and recorded by the experts listed above, all of whom are acknowledged professionals, and whom Ukraine hastened to call traitors due to their honesty in discharging their professional duties, will play an important role. \\nMore photos from the scene:\",\n",
       " 'The Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, appeared on Meet The Press with Chuck Todd on Sunday to discuss his state s new open carry law. Now, while we must say Mr. Patrick did a pretty good job at making it seem like he defended the merits of the law, in reality, all he did was provide outdated, heavily debunked statistics.Here s what Dan Patrick had to say about the relation of guns to crime data: Everywhere that we have more citizens carrying guns, crime is less. There s a study showing that where states have open carry, or concealed carry, but particulary open carry, crime is down 25%, murders are down (even). Having law-abiding citizens having guns is a good thing. In fact, Chuck, every one of the mass-shootings except two in America since 1950 have been gun-free zones. Where people have guns, bad guys don t go. Lt. Governor Patrick doesn t cite his source in the interview, but given how he just said open carry causes crime to go down 25%, we re going to assume he s referring to Florida State Rep. Matt Gaetz s (R-Fort Walton Beach) research. Matt Gaetz is the guy who came up with all this from when he sponsored a bill in October to allow open carry in his state.During a press conference, he claimed to show research that proved violent crime was  23 percent lower in states that allowed open carry, and the murder rate was 5 percent lower.  There are just a few problems with this. Politifact decided to fact-check this and determined that it was very misleading. For one, Gaetz only used data for one full year (not very historical by any means) and compiled it in such a manner that would make it impossible to draw a reasonable conclusion from. It noted that no policy makers should rely on it. Yes, anyone can come up with stats, but that doesn t make them applicable. If a policy maker were to try then and use these stats to make the claim that this proves open carry laws make people safer, then that deserves the title of fake.Florida State University criminology professor Gary Kleck doesn t think you can use just one statistic to back up a claim when several other studies are proving otherwise. Plenty of research has found rates of carry permit holding having no net effect on crime rates, including violent crime rates, one way or the other. And, not only that but the opposite appears to be true. The Washington Post published an article entitled: More gun, more crime: New research debunks central thesis of the gun rights movement. In it, it points out how Stanford law professor John Donohue has advanced decades of analysis showing that guns do in fact equal more crime. So much for the Texas Lt. Governor s argument that we need more guns to be safe. I guess this is what you get when you pick and choose your facts, heavily debunked ones at that.Featured image via screen capture.',\n",
       " '10-27-1 6 The first Bill and Hillary Clinton co-presidency included eight years of Balkan and other wars of aggression. Bush/Cheney exceeded their lawlessness. Obama outdid the worst of both previous administrations - attacking seven countries, destabilizing others, orchestrating coups in Honduras, Paraguay and Brazil, threatening Venezuelan democracy, enforcing puppet rule in Haiti, continuing Plan Colombia aid, responsible for massacres, disappearances and torture of regime opponents, along with instituting increasingly anti-Sino/Russia policies, risking confrontation with both countries. On October 27, the Wall Street Journal said 2016 electoral politics Â\\x93scrambled traditional positions on foreign policy and international intervention, obliterating many of the usual partisan distinctions and presenting political challenges for whoever wins in November.Â\\x94 Hillary will likely exceed the worst of ObamaÂ\\x92s aggressiveness Â\\x93on the international stage, according to her public statements and (what) top aidesÂ\\x94 say. SheÂ\\x92ll be more hardline on Russia, China and Iran, risking direct confrontation. Earlier she said Â\\x93I think IÂ\\x92ve been very clear that my position is in favor of what I called smart power that uses all the tools at our disposal, and military power always should be a last resort.Â\\x94 Her views as first lady, US senator and secretary of state show how often she favors it aggressively, her rage for wars insatiable. As president and commander-in-chief, sheÂ\\x92ll likely circumvent international and constitutional law like her predecessors, waging war on any nation she chooses. Former acting CIA director Michael Morell, a likely Hillary administration appointee, urges a more muscular US geopolitical role, including new sanctions on Russia and Iran, earlier saying: Â\\x93Ships leave Iran on a regular basis carrying arms to the Houthis in Yemen. I would have no problem from a policy perspective of having the US Navy boarding their ships and if there are weapons on them to turn those ships around.Â\\x94 This type aggressiveness would risk greater Middle East war than already, maybe involving Russia and China, challenging US interventionism - knowing their nations are next if itÂ\\x92s not stopped. Earlier, HillaryÂ\\x92s top national security advisor Jake Sullivan said Â\\x93(w)e need to be raising the costs to Iran for its destabilizing behavior, and we need to be raising the confidence of our Sunni partners.Â\\x94 Last yearÂ\\x92s nuclear deal failed to change overall US policy toward Iran - wanting pro-Western puppet governance replacing its sovereign independence. Instead of cooperating with Iran in furthering regional peace and stability, a Hillary administration appears planning to challenge it confrontationally - perhaps with another war in mind, a far greater challenge than against other Middle East states, especially with Russia likely to intervene if asked.

       " 'TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese police said on Wednesday they have arrested a couple whose 33-year-old daughter froze to death in a tiny room where they had confined her for years because they believed she had a form of mental illness that made her violent. Western Japan s Osaka Prefectural Police Department said Airi Kakimoto s body was found in a state of extreme malnutrition after her parents reported the death on Saturday. She was 145 cm (4.76 ft) tall and weighed just 19 kg (42 lb). Police said Yasutaka Kakimoto, 55, and Yukari Kakimoto, 53, had confessed that they fed their daughter only once a day and kept her in a 3-square-metre room for some 15 years.  Our daughter was mentally ill and, from age 16 or 17, she became violent, so we kept her inside the room,  police quoted her parents as saying. People with mental and physical disabilities and their families can still suffer stigma and shame in Japan despite some changes in public attitudes. Police said the parents added the small room - fitted with a camera and a double door that could only be unlocked from the outside - to their house and equipped it with a makeshift toilet and tube to a water tank outside. About 10 surveillance cameras were installed outside the single-storey home, which was surrounded by a 2-metre high fence, police said. The parents found their daughter dead on Dec. 18 but they reported the death Saturday.  We wanted to be together with our daughter,  police quoted them as saying. Police said the couple were arrested on suspicion of illegally disposing of a body, a step that often precedes more serious charges. ',\n",

       " 'LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Wednesday summoned a police officer investigating the case of a missing peace activist who is believed to have been kidnapped by unidentified men this month. Four activists critical of the army and its attitude towards militant groups went missing this year but reappeared after about a month. Two later said Pakistani military intelligence agents abducted and tortured them. The military denied the accusations. The latest activist to go missing is Raza Mehmood Khan, 40, a member of Aghaz-i-Dosti (Start of Friendship) group that works to build peace between arch-rivals Pakistan and India. He has not been heard from since Dec. 2 and his family filed a writ of habeas corpus in a court in the eastern city of Lahore in the belief he has been unlawfully detained, a lawyer acting for his family said. The Lahore High Court took up the case on Wednesday and the presiding judge, Anwar ul Haq, asked for the officer in charge of the police station handling the case to appear at the next hearing on Dec. 19. The lawyer, Usama Malik, told Reuters a neighbor had called police on the night of Dec. 2 to report that Khan was being kidnapped by unknown men. Khan s brother and police arrived to find Khan gone, along with his mobile telephones and computer, the lawyer said. Police were not available for comment on the court summons on Wednesday. Police said earlier they had no suspect in the case and they were investigating. On the day of his disappearance, Khan had spoken at a forum on militancy.  Everyone discussed their views and, of course, Raza was very critical,  said a friend, Rahim-ul-Haq. Khan had also posted comments on Facebook critical of the military and its suspected link to some Islamist hardliners who at the time were protesting against the civilian government.  Liberals in Pakistan have long criticized what they see as the military s use of some militant factions to further its political and security objectives. The army denies sponsoring militant factions. It regards security policy, especially towards neighbors India and Afghanistan, as its responsibility. ',\n",

       " 'Grand Central Terminal, the main building on Ellis Island and the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory at the New York Botanical Garden  â\\x80\\x94   all among the greatest New York City landmarks  â\\x80\\x94   look better today than they have since their earliest years. Many hands were responsible. John Belle was the common denominator. Mr. Belle, the retired founding partner of Beyer Blinder Belle, an architectural and planning firm that has specialized in preservation, restoration and contextual design, died last week at 84. With his death, the city has lost an architect who conveyed a genial joy in resuscitating the masterworks of his predecessors. That made him an appealingly modest figure in a room full of big architectural egos, since he was at his best when his own interventions were least obvious. New York has also lost a link to the intellectual crucible of the 1960s, when Jane Jacobs and others demanded that architects stop obliterating the past and, instead, take time to understand the many ways in which people were well served by older buildings and neighborhoods. â\\x80\\x9cPreservation is one of the highest forms of good citizenship,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Belle said on his firmâ\\x80\\x99s website. â\\x80\\x9cAs a witness to the aftermath of the urban renewal movement in New York, I was determined to find a different way. â\\x80\\x9d For her part, Ms. Jacobs held Beyer Blinder Belle in high regard. â\\x80\\x9cThey were looking at the fabric of the community,â\\x80\\x9d she said in an interview in 1998. â\\x80\\x9cThat was very welcome and very exciting, that there were professionals who were, at last, doing that. â\\x80\\x9d She added: â\\x80\\x9cA community canâ\\x80\\x99t just come by waving a wand. It has history. History was, to the modernists, an enemy. So this was a very radical realization. And an important one. â\\x80\\x9d John Belle was born on June 30, 1932, in Cardiff, Wales. His father, Arthur, was a clerk at a Lyons tea shop in Cardiff. His mother, Gladys, was a housewife. Mr. Belle received diplomas from the Portsmouth School of Architecture in England and the Architectural Association in London before moving to the United States in 1959. Once in America, Mr. Belle worked for Josep LluÃ\\xads Sert and Victor Gruen before starting his own firm in 1968 with Richard L. Blinder and John H. Beyer. Mr. Blinder died in 2006. Mr. Beyer is still active. Mr. Belleâ\\x80\\x99s early work included community planning projects in Manhattan. With the addition of James Marston Fitch to the practice in 1979, Beyer Blinder Belle began moving to the forefront of   architecture. The firm attracted wide attention in 1990 with its renovation and restoration of the abandoned Ellis Island immigration station into the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration. The vaulted ceiling in the former Registry Room, made of 28, 258 Guastavino tiles, was cleaned until it looked  â\\x80\\x94   as Mr. Belle aptly put it  â\\x80\\x94   like   . Where modern interventions were needed, they were made as inconspicuous and respectful as possible. When the Haupt Conservatory at the botanical garden in the Bronx was restored in 1997, Herbert Muschamp, who was then the architecture critic at The New York Times, said it could â\\x80\\x9conce again hold its sparkling glass head up high amid the great architectural symbols of New York. â\\x80\\x9d Though critics have faulted Beyer Blinder Belleâ\\x80\\x99s conservatism, it is worth recalling that the firm was associated in 1998 with the daring architect Santiago Calatrava in what proved to be a losing bid to redesign the James A. Farley Building, also known as the General Post Office, as a Pennsylvania Station annex. Penn Station was not where Mr. Belle was to win his greatest renown. That was at Grand Central. You almost had to have been there in the 1970s and â\\x80\\x9980s to believe how far the   terminal had fallen into decrepitude, even after its status as a landmark was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 1978. Travelers shared Grand Central with a large homeless population. â\\x80\\x9cThe building was divided into turf claimed by different drug dealers,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Belle and Maxinne R. Leighton wrote in â\\x80\\x9cGrand Central: Gateway to a Million Lives. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCommuters were scared to take trains there at night. Parents warned their children not to use the dangerous bathrooms. â\\x80\\x9d In 1990, a design and engineering consortium led by Beyer Blinder Belle began work. Their strategic first strike was to demolish a billboard called the Kodak Colorama, which had blocked daylight into the main concourse for 40 years. â\\x80\\x9cIt was as if life were being breathed back into the building,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Belle and Ms. Leighton wrote. â\\x80\\x9cMany commuters stopped in their tracks, speechless and amazed at the change that had so instantly brought back the majesty of the space. â\\x80\\x9d Their astonishment increased as the concourse ceiling was cleaned by workers on a scaffold that was rolled slowly through the room over a   period. The mud brown sky turned a startling teal, with stars, constellations and zodiac signs popping out in   contrast. Besides restoring the past, Beyer Blinder Belle made fundamental changes, too, starting with the construction of an entirely new marble staircase to the east balcony. It echoed, but did not replicate, the ornate western staircase. Some preservationists hated the idea. But the firm prevailed before city and state preservation agencies after it uncovered a plan by the original architects, Warren  Wetmore, that showed a staircase to the east balcony. That proved, Mr. Belle and Ms. Leighton wrote, that the idea â\\x80\\x9cwas not an   ploy to have our personal imprint on the building, but that in fact our goal was to complete the original design. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Muschamp, the architecture critic, approved. â\\x80\\x9cThe new eastern staircase, which threatened to diminish the roomâ\\x80\\x99s amplitude, has the opposite effect of magnifying it,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote in 1998, as the $425 million renovation neared completion. He continued, â\\x80\\x9cEven more impressive is the uncovering of the ramps, located just behind the ticket windows, that lead down to the lower level and its fabled Oyster Bar. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBeyer Blinder Belleâ\\x80\\x99s greatest accomplishment,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Muschamp said, â\\x80\\x9chas been to reveal that Grand Central is above all a monument to movement. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Belleâ\\x80\\x99s first wife, Wendy Adams Belle, an artist and teacher, died in 1974. His second wife, Anne Belle, a documentary filmmaker, died in 2003. He died on Thursday in Remsenburg, N. Y. where he had a home. He also lived in Manhattan. The cause was Lewy body disease, said his son David Belle, who survives him, along with another son, Sebastian three daughters, Amelia, Fenella and Antonia Chapman and eight grandchildren. Mr. Belle knew his work would never fully be done. â\\x80\\x9cThe act of restoring a building to its original state is only half the battle,â\\x80\\x9d he and Ms. Leighton wrote. â\\x80\\x9cThe other half is to guard against its denigration throughout its future existence. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

And let s just say that Judd s story about Trump takes him to a whole new level of creepy perv. I ve known Donald for 15, 17 years?  she began. I m friends with someone who married into the family.

And then she demonstrated exactly what Trump does. If I may, this is what it s like to talk to Donald Trump.  Judd stopped and stared pointedly at my chest.  He s a chest gazer, a breast gazer, let s be more specific and, referring to the person who at that time was married into the family, he just sexualized her.  Doesn t she look great? Doesn t she look ?  He s just revolting. And it s not like Trump hasn t publicly displayed his creepiness.On multiple occasions, Trump has fantasized about his own daughter.

I don t think Ivanka would do that, although she does have a very nice figure. I ve said if Ivanka weren t my daughter, perhaps I d be dating her. And that was just in 2006.

If I weren t happily married and, ya know, her father . . . So yeah, Donald Trump treats all women, even his own daughter, as sexual objects. He s disgusting.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a challenge by Procter & Gamble Co and other companies to the way California imposes taxes on businesses that operate in multiple states. The justices left in place a December 2015 ruling by the California Supreme Court that California is not bound by a 1967 agreement between states that set a formula for calculating taxes. California, which joined the Multistate Tax Compact in 1974, changed the formula in 1993. California has since withdrawn from the state compact. Several companies, including two Procter & Gamble subsidiaries, Kimberly-Clark Worldwide Inc and Merck KGaA subsidiary Sigma-Aldrich Corp, sued in 2010 after being denied refunds for the tax they paid between 1993 and 2005. The companies said they overpaid their taxes by $34 million. Lawyers for the companies had said $750 million in potential tax refunds in California and additional amounts in other states were at stake in the case. Many states have moved away from the Multistate Tax Compact formula. To favor and attract businesses within their borders, these states have rearranged the way they tax business income so that in-state businesses pay less and out-of-state businesses pay more. ',\n",
       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - An aardvark was killed and four meerkats are missing believed dead after a blaze tore through part of London Zoo early on Saturday, destroying a cafe and gift shop. The fire broke out shortly after 0600 GMT at the zoo s Animal Adventure section before spreading to the shop and cafe, near to an area where visitors can handle and feed animals, the zoo and London Fire Brigade said. More than 70 firefighters took three hours to bring the fire under control while desperate keepers who live on the site in Regent s Park in central London moved animals to safety. Some of the staff needed treatment for smoke inhalation and shock. Ten-year-old Misha the aardvark, one of the zoo s best-loved animals, perished in the fire and four of the meerkats were unaccounted for and are also presumed to have died. Taking their name from the Afrikaans word for  earth-pig , aardvarks are large burrowing mammals found across much of Africa.  We re absolutely devastated that Misha the aardvark has been killed and we re still trying to find out what happened to the meerkats, but at the moment the site where this fire took place is closed down,  Dominic Jermey, the zoo s Director General, told BBC TV.   At the moment we re not certain what has happened to the meerkats but I m not optimistic at this stage, unfortunately.  Other animals nearby are being monitored by vets, but the zoo said indications were that they were unaffected. It said it hoped to reopen on Sunday. It is the world s oldest scientific zoo, dating from 1826, and houses 20,166 animals, according to its inventory for 2017.  The fire brigade said it had sent 10 fire engines and 72 firefighters to the scene and added that the cause of the blaze was under investigation.

       " 'Last week, news broke that white supremacist and former Breitbart head Stever Bannon had been given a seat on the  principals committee    a role usually reserved for generals   while the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence had been  downgraded  and they were told to only attend meetings when issues in their direct area of expertise are being considered.But why would Trump choose to place this much power in the hands of Steve Bannon? It turns out it wasn t a choice. The New York Times reports that Trump is signing executive orders without bothering to find out what is in them, and that it was not until after he had signed it that Trump realized one of his numerous executive orders had made Bannon one of the most powerful men in the country:Mr. Priebus bristles at the perception that he occupies a diminished perch in the West Wing pecking order compared with previous chiefs. But for the moment, Mr. Bannon remains the president s dominant adviser, despite Mr. Trump s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban.Yes, you read that correctly: our President cares so little about doing his job properly that he doesn t even bother to find out the details of the executive orders he is signing   even if he is granting an insane amount of power to someone who should not be taken seriously when offering his opinion on ice cream flavors.Bannon s influence has steadily grown as Trump s time in office has passed, to the point that it is not unreasonable to call him   not Trump    President.  While this is a popular turn of events among white supremacists, a group that was courted heavily by Bannon s propaganda outlet, the rest of the country is steadily growing weary of dealing with someone like Bannon   who has described himself as a  Leninist  who wants to  destroy the state    having any power at all.Featured image via screengrab',\n",

       " 'SYDNEY (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea will delay by at least 24 hours a plan to forcibly evict hundreds of men from an abandoned Australian detention center, three asylum seekers said on Saturday. Hundreds of men have barricaded themselves into the Manus island center for more than 11 days without regular food or water, defying closure bids by Australia and Papua New Guinea in what the United Nations calls a  looming humanitarian crisis . Rejecting United Nations calls to restore utilities to the camp, Papua New Guinea this week said it would  apprehend  those responsible for the stand-off when it forcibly evicted the men on Saturday. But several asylum seekers said Papua New Guinea officials told them detainees could remain until Sunday.  Police are talking on a microphone outside prison,  Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran, who has spent more than four years detained in the camp, told Reuters.  They re telling the refugees to leave, saying tomorrow will be the last day you are here,  he said in a text message. It was not immediately clear what caused the postponement. Pressure on the asylum seekers, drawn largely from Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Syria, has grown in recent days as Papua New Guinea tries to get them to  move to three transit centers. The asylum seekers fear reprisals if they move to the transit centers, pending possible resettlement in the United States. The main camp was closed on Oct. 31 and water and power have been cut off. Some island-dwellers are angry at what they perceive as preferential treatment for the asylum seekers, many of them well educated, in a poor, rural society, and some detainees have come under attack when on release from the camp. The patience of Papua New Guinea authorities has begun to wane, however, and they moved this week to remove camp fences and dismantle rainwater collection bins and makeshift shelters built to ward off the tropical sun and rain. Under pressure, groups of men have elected to move to the transit centers.  But the exact number left is difficult to ascertain, though Manus Island police commander David Yapu told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation about 400 remain. Several of those remaining told Reuters they would not move, setting the scene for a potential clash, which would further stoke international criticism of Australia. Australia has used the center, and a camp on the tiny Pacific island of Nauru, to detain asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat. It says boat arrivals will never enter Australia, even if found to be refugees, as this would encourage people smugglers in Asia. Australia says the policy prevents people drowning at sea, but it has been widely condemned. Acting Prime Minister Julie Bishop said there was no reason for the remaining men to choose to stay, rejecting criticism of inadequate facilities at the transit centers.  Over the last few months they have traveled to East Lorengau on many occasions and never raised any concerns,  Bishop told reporters in Perth. ',\n",

The joke seemed to have gone stale after a while, so I switched to Britain.

       " 'WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday he would end the United Statesâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9cdealâ\\x80\\x9d with Cuba unless a better one was made, reflecting his campaign pledge to reverse President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s moves to open relations with the Cold War adversary. â\\x80\\x9cIf Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said in a Twitter post.  Some Cubans are worried Trump will shut down the U.S.-Cuban trade and travel ties that have begun to emerge in the past two years since Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s historic decision to end decades of Cold War hostility and open an embassy in Havana. U.S. airlines launched the first regular flights to Havana in more than five decades on Monday. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s tweeted as Cubans commemorated Fidel Castro, the guerrilla leader who led a revolution in 1959 and ruled the Caribbean island for half a century. Castro died on Friday. During Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign for the White House he had said he thought restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba was fine but that Obama should have cut a better deal. Newsweek reported that one of his companies had attempted to do business in the Communist-ruled island. Later in the campaign, he toughened his rhetoric, seeking to reassure Cuban-American voters in Florida that he opposed Castro and his brother, Raul, to whom he turned over power in 2008. On Saturday, Trump said in a statement that his administration would â\\x80\\x9cdo all it canâ\\x80\\x9d once he takes office on Jan. 20 to boost freedom and prosperity for Cubans after Castroâ\\x80\\x99s death. Cuba always has fiercely resisted what it sees as U.S. involvement in its politics. The government has stayed mostly quiet on Trump, waiting to see whether he converts his rhetoric into policy change. The makeup of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s transition team has suggested he could with the inclusion of Mauricio Claver-Carone, a leading advocate for maintaining a tough economic embargo, and Robert Blau, a hard-line anti-communist who was openly hostile toward the Castro government while posted as a diplomat in Havana during the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. Many Cubans are defiant, however, saying their main problem was the U.S. economic embargo. â\\x80\\x9cWe have lived for 50 years with the blockade so we are going to continue living the same way with or without Trump,â\\x80\\x9d Teresa Almentero, 52, a cigar roller, said after paying tribute to Castro in Revolution Square. â\\x80\\x9cHe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t scare me, nor does he scare any Cuban.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",
       " 'Humans Are Free Baking Soda & Coconut Oil Can Kill Cancer: Eye-Opening Evidence \\nA woman diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma skin cancer located on the crown on her head managed to cure it by applying baking soda paste directly on the affected area. \\nAt first, when her daughter insisted, she refused, but then she decided to give it a try. After three major surgeries, the cancer returned and each time it was even worse, so she decided to trust nature and started using pure cold pressed organic coconut oil instead of water and baking soda . \\nCoconut oil has cellular regenerative powers, which is why she applied the thick paste directly onto the affected area. \\nAzizo, her daguhter, used only Polysporin Triple 3 Antibiotics, and she applied them only at night. \\nYou are allowed to use other antibiotic ointment just as a precaution against bacterial infections within the sore area. For instance, you can use colloidal silver soaked cotton as well. \\nOnce the wound is closed, you can stop using the ointment. Azizo continued applying the combination of baking soda and coconut oil, but she also applied cotton ball soaked in ACV and taped it to the skin. \\nAs a result, this induced the penetraton of baking soda to the basal cell carcinoma roots beyond the skinâ\\x80\\x99s surface. Yet another even better solution for this purpose is DMSO. \\nAzizo continued applying this remedy to her mother for 38 days, and finally, the woman was completely free from skin cancer and the wound healed in no time. \\nYou can read their story and learn more about the method she used by following this link . \\nEven though this skin cancer is nor deadly as melanoma can be, it can still continue spreading on the skin if itâ\\x80\\x99s not properly cured. \\nIf you didnâ\\x80\\x99t know, tumors only thrive in acidic environments, which makes baking soda an excellent solution since it provides only alkaline environment. \\nDramatic Life and Death Story \\nVernon Johnson, recently divorced and low on cash was diagnosed with stage III prostate cancer, which metastasized into the hip area and soon developed in stage IV. \\nHe was supposed to be examined about the therapy he needed to undergo in several weeks, when his son suggested him to try several substances that could rapidly alkalize on a cellular level. \\nEven though he ordered cesium, it never arrived, so he used baking soda and blackstrap mollases, instead of maple syrup. \\nThe Trojan Horse sugar should open cancer cells wide so that they could receive the highly alkaline influence of baking soda. This should eventually result in destruction of cancer cells. \\nAfter two weeks of using this natural solution, his bone scan showed that there is no spreading of the cancer. The PSA dropped from 22 to 5 to 1 over the course of his treatment and pharmaceutical prescriptions. \\nHowever, beside his treatment, Vernon started spending a lot of time on sunlight, switched to a healthier plant based diet and did breathing exercises on a regular basis in order to increase the oxygen delivery to the cancer affected area. \\nMoreover he wrote a book called â\\x80\\x9c Vernonâ\\x80\\x99s Dance With Cancer: After the Jolt â\\x80\\x9d, where he shared his experience with cancer. \\nHe wrote this book over five years after the original baking soda alkaline producing treatment. Five years later, he is cancer free and he gives lectures about the treatment. \\nIt should be mentioned that there are certain foods that produce alkalinity in the body, while certain acidic foods such as lemon and limes become alkaline in the body right after their ingestion. Make sure to incorporate baking soda in your life since it is alkaline and produces alkalinity. \\nDr. Mark Sircus is an Italian former physician who is now an alternative health practitioner. Based on his experience as an oncology surgeon, he injects baking soda solution into the blood vessels that feed tumors. \\nAccording to Dr. Simoncini , there is no pharmaceutical anti-fungal that is more effective and safe than baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate. \\nMoreover, he also claims that cancer thrives on fungal colonies which also create cancer. His claim resulted in removing of his physician certification in Italy. \\nAs you can see, baking soda is extremely powerful natural ingredient which should receive more attention and examination, or at least is should be considered as a complementary treatment for severe ailments and a total approach for minor ailments.',\n",
       " 'MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) said on Thursday registration for PRI contenders in the July 2018 presidential election will begin on Dec. 3, and that a national convention would pick the candidate on Feb. 18. In a statement, the PRI said the national convention would be made up of around 19,100 delegates to be chosen during the second week of December. President Enrique Pena Nieto is barred by law from seeking a second six-year term. Ruling Mexico continuously from 1929, the PRI had become a byword for corruption by the time it was voted out in 2000. Pena Nieto returned the party to power in 2012, but a slew of corruption scandals, ongoing gang violence and anemic growth have sapped the PRI s credibility in the past five years. The party faces an uphill struggle to hang on to power, and veteran leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, twice a runner-up for the presidency, has led most early polling for 2018. The run-up to the election takes place in the midst of fraught discussions between Mexico, the United States and Canada over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which underpins much of the region s commerce. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to walk away from the accord if he cannot rework it in favor of the United States. The three nations have pledged to keep talking through March.  ',\n",

       " 'The   psychiatric hospital here in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, has long been a forgotten place, filled with forgotten people. But with Venezuela suffering from a severe economic crisis, this mental institution has almost no drugs to control the afflictions tormenting its patients. At the invitation of doctors, reporters from The New York Times visited six psychiatric wards across the country. All reported shortages of medicine, even food. The one here, El Pampero Hospital, hasnâ\\x80\\x99t employed a psychiatrist in two years. It has running water for only a few hours a day, and food is scarce. Omar Mendoza, pictured above, is one of many undernourished patients. He lost half his weight this summer and is down to about 75 pounds. The glue that keeps this hospital in order  â\\x80\\x94   the sedatives, tranquilizers and medications  â\\x80\\x94   is nearly all gone. In courtyards, women who are functional while medicated are now curled on the floor hallucinating, crying, screaming, rocking back and forth for hours. The doctors and nurses here are aghast at what is taking place, caught between anger and feelings of helplessness. The nursing staff debates daily: Who gets the few remaining pills? Who is the most unstable, or suffering the most? They reduce doses, doling out pills into small metal cups with the fluidity of Las Vegas casino dealers. El Pampero also suffers from shortages of basic   and cleaning supplies. There is no soap, no shampoo, no toothpaste, no toilet paper. Patients relieve themselves in the common areas and patio area, and clean themselves only with water. Nurses fear that patients in the menâ\\x80\\x99s ward are more likely to become violent when they are unmedicated. Two of the men in this photograph murdered members of their families before their schizophrenia was diagnosed. One decapitated his mother, and the other stabbed his stepfather. We found Cleofila Carillo crying softly under a mosquito net. The morning before, her unmedicated bunkmate had leapt on top of her, beaten her, bitten off her nose and eaten it. Doctors said she needed full reconstructive surgery, but because of the shortages, they did not have the medical supplies to perform it. All they could do was apply a bandage. Without sedatives, nurses say, they must restrain patients or lock them in isolation cells to keep them from harming themselves. That is what happened to Raul MartÃ\\xadnez, who was suffering a psychotic episode. A nurse tied him to a gurney. Patients eat three times a day, but there is never enough food from the government. Members of the hospital staff solicit donations during their time off. Medical records show that over half of the patients in the menâ\\x80\\x99s ward are underweight. Clothes are also in short supply at the hospital. Many patients in the womenâ\\x80\\x99s ward wear only   and few have shoes. The clothing they do have is ill fitting and threadbare. Nurses fashion belts out of surgical gloves and pieces of rope to keep patientsâ\\x80\\x99 pants from sliding off their slight frames. Down the hall, Ms. Carilloâ\\x80\\x99s attacker had been isolated and locked inside a small solitary confinement cell. She yelled at nurses when they asked why she had bitten off and swallowed her roommateâ\\x80\\x99s nose. â\\x80\\x9cIt wasnâ\\x80\\x99t me, I did not do it,â\\x80\\x9d she repeated, claiming that she did not know what they were talking about. When Yusmar Torres had no medication to control her mood disorder and depression, she constructed a noose out of a bedsheet and threatened to commit suicide. The staff stripped her of her clothes for safety and put her in a solitary confinement cell, where she was left for days. There are few light moments in El Pampero, but every Friday morning, therapists put on salsa music and hold a dance for the 10 percent of patients who are stable enough to participate. Before the medicine shortages, the recreation center held weekly sewing, cooking and sculpture classes, even a farming program. One therapist said: â\\x80\\x9cWhen patients have their medicines, they can do really complex crafts. Now they just do simple tasks. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. MartÃ\\xadnez, who suffers from schizophrenia but has little medication, took a nap under his bed. He also suffers from depression. The head nurse, Evila GarcÃ\\xada, fed a blind patient as a stray cat roamed the womenâ\\x80\\x99s ward dining hall. Several stray dogs and cats live in the hospital, and the dogs often sleep with patients in their beds. Nurses worry about parasites because the animals have not had their shots and have not been dewormed, but some patients find comfort in them. The Venezuelan government denies that its public hospitals are suffering from shortages, and has refused multiple offers of international medical aid. Josefina Zapata, a patient suffering from psychosis and epilepsy, was in solitary confinement. She was not violent, but the hospital staff did not have the anticonvulsants she needed. The staff regularly kept her locked in this cell, on a mattress on the floor, so that when she started convulsing, she was less likely to hurt herself. The vast majority of patients living at El Pampero have been abandoned by their families and rely completely on the state to meet their basic needs. â\\x80\\x9cMay God have mercy on us,â\\x80\\x9d the head nurse said.',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials are discussing whether to withhold a portion of U.S. assistance to Egypt to protest Egyptian passage of a law that imposes restrictions on non-governmental organizations, a senior administration official said on Wednesday. Officials have not reached an agreement on whether to proceed with a recommendation to President Donald Trump and his senior leadership, but there is a feeling that some action is necessary in reaction to the move by Egypt, the official told Reuters. U.S. aid to Egypt has long been sacrosanct. Egypt is one of Washingtonâ\\x80\\x99s closest allies in the Middle East, receiving $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid and about $200 million in economic assistance annually. â\\x80\\x9cWe told them over and over again donâ\\x80\\x99t do this, that they are putting at risk U.S. aid, but they did it anyway,â\\x80\\x9d the official said. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re figuring out how to respond.â\\x80\\x9d The discussions involve cutting off a portion of American aid, not all of it, the official said. The Egyptian law restricts NGO activity to developmental and social work and introduces jail terms of up to give years for non-compliance. Egyptian lawmakers said the law was necessary to protect national security. The government has long accused human rights groups of taking foreign funds to sow chaos and several are facing investigation over their funding. In May, when the law was issued after being ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, U.S. senators criticized it. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham called it â\\x80\\x9cdraconian legislationâ\\x80\\x9d and they said the U.S. Congress should in response â\\x80\\x9cstrengthen democratic benchmarks and human rights conditions on U.S. assistance for Egypt.â\\x80\\x9d  U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, and nine other senators sent Trump a letter on June 19 urging the president to press Sisi on the issue. â\\x80\\x9cThe U.S. Congress will take the Egyptian governmentâ\\x80\\x99s recent actions into consideration as we review our bilateral assistance to Egypt to ensure that the American peopleâ\\x80\\x99s tax dollars are used appropriately,â\\x80\\x9d the letter said. U.S. President Barack Obama froze aid to Egypt for two years after Sisi, then a general, overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in mid-2013 after mass protests against Mursiâ\\x80\\x99s rule. Trump has been intent on rebooting the bilateral relationship with Sisi and building on the strong connection the two presidents established when they first met in New York last September. Trump gave Sisi firm backing and vowed to work together to fight Islamist militants when Sisi visited the White House in April. ',\n",
       " 'If Donald Trump picked retired General David Petraeus as the next Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense, it would be his worst hypocrisy to date.For months, Trump attacked Hillary Clinton relentlessly for keeping a private email server as Secretary of States, accusing her of exposing classified information even though the FBI cleared her of any such wrongdoing.You know who the FBI didn t clear of such wrongdoing? David Petraeus.And that s why Trump would be a hypocrite if he actually offered him either significant government posts. But he is doing exactly that.Back in 2012, Petraeus infamously resigned as Director of the CIA after it was revealed that he had been engaged in an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, whom he gave access to eight  Black Books  filled with highly classified information, which included  the identities of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence capabilities and mechanisms, diplomatic discussions,  and discussions he had with President Obama.It was such a terrible breach in national security that the Justice Department wanted to prosecute him for committing a felony, and would have if Petraeus had not agreed to a plea deal in 2015.So while Hillary Clinton was doing nothing different from what other Secretaries of State have done, it s pretty clear that what Petraeus did makes him the real threat to national security.And it s unclear if he could even get the security clearance necessary for a Secretary of State or Defense to have in order to do the job. After all, Trump said of Clinton in September that,  If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldn t even get a security clearance. Obviously, Trump could always pull strings and we already know that Republicans in Congress are hypocrites who can be easily bought. But picking Petraeus for either one of these top jobs would demonstrate that he is a hypocrite who doesn t give a damn about national security and that he has a double standard.By picking Petraeus, Trump would also be admitting once again that he lied to his supporters. Trump has been stringing them along for months getting them to chant  Lock her up  every time he calls Hillary Clinton a criminal. But if anybody should be locked up, it s Petraeus. He literally shared highly classified information that could have put people and the country at risk. But Trump is considering him anyway and that is infuriating.Featured Image: Wikimedia',\n",

       " 'BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian and U.S. officials are in talks about a White House visit by President Michel Temer to discuss bilateral trade and investment issues, two sources in Temerâ\\x80\\x99s office said on Wednesday.   U.S. President Donald Trump invited Temer for a visit during a March 18 phone call, when the two leaders discussed deepening commercial and business ties between the Western Hemisphereâ\\x80\\x99s largest economies, the sources said. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s promises to defend U.S. companies from foreign competition have worried Washingtonâ\\x80\\x99s partners in much of Latin America, especially Mexico which is under pressure to rework a free-trade deal with its northern neighbor.       But the center-right Temer government hopes to see business opportunities opening up with the United States as it struggles to rescue the Brazilian economy from a two-year recession. Industries in Brazil, whose biggest trading partner is China, are benefiting from a weaker real currency. They could potentially increase their U.S. market share, if Trump advances on his threats overhaul or pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. â\\x80\\x9cWe are not a threat to the United States and there are plenty of investment opportunities in both countries,â\\x80\\x9d one of the sources, a senior government official, said. The sources asked not to be identified because they had not been authorized to speak about Temerâ\\x80\\x99s possible White House visit publicly. No date for the visit has been set, they said.

       " 'IT S TIME TO DRAIN OBAMA S SWAMP! Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the head of the House Oversight Committee, criticized the director of the federal Office of Government Ethics on Thursday over his criticism of Donald Trump s plan to address conflicts of interest. And he threatened to subpoena the official, Walter Shaub, if he refuses to participate in an official interview. He seems to be acting prematurely at best, without doing investigations or thorough looks,  Chaffetz said in an interview.  He s rendering opinions publicly that really cause you to scratch your head. We need the Office of Government Ethics to act ethically. Ironically, that s not what they re doing. Shaub, an appointee of President Barack Obama, has been a frequent critics of the incoming administration s ethics plans, peaking Wednesday when he called Trump s newly unveiled conflicts of interest policy  meaningless. The public rebuke of Trump s business arrangements came during a press conference at the Brookings Institution that included the outspoken former White House ethics lawyers for Obama and former President George W. Bush. In his remarks, Shaub said the president-elect  stepping back from running his positions is meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective. The plan does not comport with the tradition of our presidents over the last 40 years,  he added.Chaffetz said Shaub has refused since the election to agree to a meeting to discuss matters related to OGE s public remarks about Trump, as well as the Republican-led panel s plans to pass language reauthorizing the office. If Shaub continues to resist, Chaffetz said he d issue a subpoena  if we have to. He is coming in. This is not going to be an optional exercise,  Chaffetz said, adding that he expected a meeting within a few weeks.Shaub s 5-year term expires in January 2018. We need a fair person behind the plate that s going to call balls and strikes,  Chaffetz said.  What they re supposed to do is help work with somebody to comply with the ethics requirements. But when you talk publicly about private conversations, that s not ethical. And when you refuse to come in and talk to the committee when you re doing reauthorization, when you start tweeting and issuing press statements on things you never looked at, that shouldn t be the case at all. This isn t Chaffetz s first time challenging Shaub. In late 2015, the Republican accused the Obama appointee of giving Hillary Clinton a pass on conflict-of-interest laws over speaking fees she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, were supposed to disclose. But Chaffetz said he s grown more frustrated with Shaub since the November election and also singled out the OGE s use of its official Twitter account to issue a bizarre series of posts   in Trump s own staccato style   congratulating the president-elect for making major changes to his business arrangements.For entire story: POLITICO ',\n",
       " 'THE STING videos targeting Planned Parenthood are hard to watch. Doctors talk clinically, some say callously, about harvesting fetal tissue. Technicians identify and isolate tiny organs. References are made to â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a babyâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s another boy.â\\x80\\x9d The videos were taken surreptitiously and were artfully edited to produce maximum discomfort about complicated issues that, for many, are inherently uncomfortable.\\n\\nThat truths were distorted to paint an inaccurate and unfair picture of a health organization that provides valuable services to women â\\x80\\x94 as well as to demonize research that leads to important medical advances â\\x80\\x94 doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter to antiabortion activists. Or, sadly, to the politicians who pander to them.\\n\\nPlanned Parenthood is under virulent attack for the role a small portion of its affiliates play in helping women who want to donate fetal tissue for medical research. The antiabortion group Center for Medical Progress has orchestrated a propaganda campaign accusing the nationâ\\x80\\x99s largest provider of abortions of profiting from the illegal sale of fetal tissue, a charge refuted by Planned Parenthood.\\n\\nNone of the videos released shows anything illegal and, in fact, the full footage of Planned Parenthood executives meeting with people presumed to be buyers for a human biologics company include repeated assertions that clinics are not selling tissue but only seeking permitted reimbursement costs for expenses. Indeed, the Colorado clinic featured in the videos refused to enter into a contract with the phony company because of its failure to meet its legal and ethical standards.\\n\\nSuch facts, though, havenâ\\x80\\x99t stopped officials in several Republican-led states, including Texas, Louisiana and Ohio, from launching investigations of Planned Parenthood, even though affiliates in those states donâ\\x80\\x99t facilitate fetal tissue donations. In Washington, Senate Republicans have fast-tracked a bid to defund Planned Parenthood, with a vote set for Monday. Fortunately, itâ\\x80\\x99s unlikely there will be 60 votes to advance the bill, as cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood would be irresponsible.\\n\\nNo federal money is used by Planned Parenthood to provide abortions except in some rare exceptions. So cutting off government funds, mostly through Medicaid and grants, would only hurt the thousands of people, most of them low-income women, who each day depend upon Planned Parenthood for birth control, cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and other health services. Given that many of the clinics are in medically underserved areas, itâ\\x80\\x99s a myth, as Republicans claim, that other providers can fill the gap. Shutting down clinics would make it harder for many women to obtain birth control â\\x80\\x94 and the last thing either side of the abortion debate should want is an increase in unwanted pregnancies that result in more abortions.\\n\\nWe are under no illusions that the vendetta against Planned Parenthood will end. Conservative Republicans are already threatening to shut down the federal government in the fall by blocking any spending that includes money for Planned Parenthood. Itâ\\x80\\x99s clear from how quickly Republican presidential hopefuls seized on the issue that it will be a staple of the campaign trail. Consequently, itâ\\x80\\x99s important that congressional Democrats and others continue to stand up for Planned Parenthood and the women whose health depends upon its services.',\n",
       " 'ABOARD WAVERTREE IN KILL VAN KULL  â\\x80\\x94   In the 131 years since the   cargo ship Wavertree was built, it has been tossed and tattered  â\\x80\\x94   its main mast ripped away in a hurricane, and its role demoted to sand barge. So when the vessel sailed from the South Street Seaport to Staten Island last year for a    restoration, the crew feared that the extensive damage would draw out repairs and delay the shipâ\\x80\\x99s return to its Manhattan berth. They should have known better. Wavertree, which has endured no shortage of natural and economic calamity, turned out to be more resilient than anyone anticipated. In September, after more than a year away, it is set to return to the South Street Seaport Museum, mended, gleaming and ready to remind visitors of the ships that define New York Cityâ\\x80\\x99s history. The   $13 million   undertaking has progressed ahead of schedule, hastening the goal of once again sailing Wavertree through New York Harbor. â\\x80\\x9cWe were pleasantly surprised,â\\x80\\x9d Jonathan Boulware, the executive director of the seaport museum, said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a real testament to the eraâ\\x80\\x99s wrought iron. â\\x80\\x9d When it was commissioned in Southampton, England, by R. W. Leyland  Company of Liverpool, Wavertree was among the last   sailing ships fashioned from wrought iron and it remains the largest afloat, according to the museum. Last May, workers brought it by tugboat to the Caddell Dry Dock and Repair Company in the Richmond Terrace section of Staten Island and expected to replace 10 large metal plates on the hull. Instead, the 4     slabs of iron, which sit below the water line, needed only minor repairs. Wavertree has nonetheless required an ambitious overhaul, carried out by a crew of up to three dozen. The ship spent five months in dry dock, where workers scrubbed away barnacles, seaweed and other gunk before adding layers of protective paint to its underside. The team has also been replacing three decks. The wood that once covered the main deck has been exchanged for steel to keep out water. The poop deck is being repaired traditionally, using wooden planks caulked with cotton and oakum then sealed with pitch. And Wavertree once again has its â\\x80\\x99tween deck, a modest level between the main deck and the cargo hold that had been absent for decades. The most daunting task, workers said, has been the renovation of the shipâ\\x80\\x99s three   masts and their rigging. For that, Caddell built a pair of    sheds outfitted with both   and highly modern tools. Inside one, the crew is building 16 spars from laminated timber. The other has held more than three miles of wire, which was stripped of its old protective coating and wrapped in a new layer of   pine and leather. Though the crew did not expect to fully rig the ship by September, time and money saved on the hull plates accelerated the schedule. â\\x80\\x9cI marvel at how effectively and efficiently weâ\\x80\\x99ve been able to conduct the restoration,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Boulware said. Although its immense iron frame and masts give Wavertree a distinguished profile today, it was a relatively common model when it was built by Oswald Mordaunt  Company in 1885. A plaque identifies the   Wavertree as the companyâ\\x80\\x99s hull No. 231. Mr. Boulware noted that stringers, which fortify the hull, on the shipâ\\x80\\x99s port side dip below those on its starboard  â\\x80\\x94   one of several imperfections in the construction. The cramped quarters once held bunk beds stacked tightly to accommodate a crew of 35 men in the shipâ\\x80\\x99s heyday. Over the years, Wavertree circumnavigated the globe nearly 30 times, ferrying sundry cargo  â\\x80\\x94   coal, kerosene, jute, cotton, tea, coffee, molasses, timber. On Jan. 14, 1895, it called on the Port of New York, bearing a load of nitrate from Chile. In 1910, a violent storm off Cape Horn splintered Wavertreeâ\\x80\\x99s masts, ending its   days. Its owners sold the ship to Chilean businessmen, who used it as a warehouse for 30 years. It transferred hands again in 1947, beginning a career as a sand barge in Buenos Aires. Wavertree was acquired by the museum in 1968. The shipâ\\x80\\x99s homecoming was made possible in part by the impending departure of Peking, another   sailing ship, which has graced the seaport since 1974. Peking, too, has been battered  â\\x80\\x94   by war, by waves and by weather. It suffered through plummeting tourism in Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks, and the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Faced with mounting financial difficulties, the museum considered dispensing with the   barque, which was built in Hamburg, Germany, in 1911. However, salvation came from the German government, which is spending 30 million euros (about $33 million) to bring Peking home, carried across the Atlantic Ocean on the back of a   ship. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll be sad to see her go, but itâ\\x80\\x99s whatâ\\x80\\x99s best for everyone,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Boulware, said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s about resource allocation. â\\x80\\x9d Funding for Wavertreeâ\\x80\\x99s restoration has come from the City Council, the office of the Manhattan borough president and the cityâ\\x80\\x99s Cultural Affairs Department. â\\x80\\x9cWavertree is an incredible object with a direct connection to the site that really gives the area an authentic sense of its past,â\\x80\\x9d Tom Finkelpearl, the departmentâ\\x80\\x99s commissioner, said. The Wavertree project was also helped by a $4. 8 million grant given to the museum in March by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. The money will go toward improving safety and accessibility at the museum, and adding an    education center, Mr. Boulware said. â\\x80\\x9cThe port is what built the city and what continues to build it today,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Boulware said, showing off the museumâ\\x80\\x99s first new exhibition since 2012, â\\x80\\x9cStreet of Ships: The Port and Its People. â\\x80\\x9d It plumbed the museumâ\\x80\\x99s collections to tell the history of the Port of New York, once the fulcrum of world shipping. That exhibition will be complete, Mr. Boulware said, when Wavertree assumes its place again in the museumâ\\x80\\x99s marina.',\n",

If the two of them decide they don t want you running for office, you likely won t stand a chance The tens of thousands of emails on Hillary Clinton s private server from when she was secretary of state could also be on a second device or server, according to news reports.The FBI now has the only confirmed private server, as part of a Justice Department probe to determine whether it sent of received classified information for Clinton when she was the country s top diplomat from 2009 to 2013.Platte River Networks, which managed Clinton s server and private email network after she left the State Department, has indicated it transfer   or  migrated    emails from the original server in 2013, according to The Washington Examiner.However, Clinton, the front-running Democratic presidential candidate, has suggested that she gave the department 55,000 pages of official emails and deleted roughly 30,000 personal ones in January, which raises the possibility they were culled from a second device.Neither a Clinton spokesman nor an attorney for the Colorado-based Platte River Networks returned an Examiner s request for comment, the news gathering agency reported Saturday.The DailyMail.com on Aug. 14 was among the first to report the possibility of a second server.The FBI took the server last week, after a U.S. Intelligence Community inspector general reportedly found two Clinton emails that included sensitive information, then asked the FBI to further investigate.Platte River Networks has told news agencies that the server, now in New Jersey, has been wiped clean. But forensics experts still might be able to recover some information.There have been reports that some of the emails that Clinton turned over included classified information. Clinton maintains that she neither sent nor received classified data, which suggests the missives might have been marked after the fact as classified or with some other top-secret classification.The emails that Clinton gave to the State Department were on multiple storage devices. A Clinton lawyer turned over at least one thumb drive that reportedly included copies of the emails that his client has already given to the federal government.Clinton has maintained that she has done nothing wrong or illegal and says she will cooperate fully with the non-criminal investigations.Via: FOX News ',\n",

       " 'LOS ANGELES  â\\x80\\x94   Nine days after Nikolas Michaudâ\\x80\\x99s latest heroin relapse, the skinny    sat on a roof deck at a new drug rehabilitation clinic here. He picked up a bong, filled it with a pinch of marijuana, lit the leaves and inhaled. All this took place in plain view of the clinicâ\\x80\\x99s director. â\\x80\\x9cThe rules here are a little lax,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Michaud said. In almost any other rehab setting in the country, smoking pot would be a major infraction and a likely cause for being booted out. But here at High Sobriety  â\\x80\\x94   the clinic with a name that sounds like the title of a Cheech and Chong comeback movie  â\\x80\\x94   it is not just permitted, but part of the treatment. The new clinic is experimenting with a concept made possible by the growing legalization of marijuana: that pot, rather than being a gateway into drugs, could be a gateway out. A small but growing number of pain doctors and addiction specialists are overseeing the use of marijuana as a substitute for more potent and dangerous drugs. Dr. Mark Wallace, chairman of the division of pain medicine in the department of anesthesia at the University of California, San Diego, said over the last five years he has used marijuana to help several hundred patients transition off opiates. â\\x80\\x9cThe majority of patients continue to use it,â\\x80\\x9d he said of marijuana. But he added that they tell him of the opiates: â\\x80\\x9cI feel like I was a slave to that drug. I feel like I have my life back. â\\x80\\x9d Dr. Wallace is quick to note that his evidence is anecdotal and more study is needed. Research in rats, he said, supports the idea that the use of cannabinoids can induce withdrawal from heavier substances. But in humans? A report published in  January from the National Academy of Sciences on the health effects of cannabis â\\x80\\x9cfound no evidence to support or refute the conclusion that cannabinoids are an effective treatment for achieving abstinence in the use of addictive substances,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. Marie McCormick, a Harvard professor who was the chairwoman of the report committee. The groupâ\\x80\\x99s research did find strong evidence to support that cannabis or related compounds can be used to treat chronic pain in adults. But that is different from using it safely and effectively to wean people off drugs, and some experts in the addiction field are highly skeptical. â\\x80\\x9cThe concept on its face is absurd,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. Mark Willenbring, a psychiatrist who treats addicts and formerly oversaw research at the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. He said that alternative approaches are needed to traditional drug treatment, but not this. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not prone to making exaggerated or unqualified statements and in this case I donâ\\x80\\x99t need to make any: It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t work,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cLike trying to cure alcoholism with Valium. â\\x80\\x9d The idea stems not only from the legalization of marijuana in several states, including California, but also from a broader reckoning taking place in the traditional addiction treatment business:   treatment often fails, costing families, the government or insurers tens of thousands of dollars per therapy. Many patients quit partway through treatment, or relapse time and again. These failings have become more apparent owing to a handful of developments: a growing death toll from opiates and an increase in the death rate of young white adults caused by drug overdoses. There also is a growing conversation about whether some update is needed to the bedrock   program: It demands total abstinence but many people fail and ultimately die. Some research suggests that marijuana might help stem the tide. A study published in 2014 in JAMA Internal Medicine found that states with medical marijuana laws have lower rates of death from opiate overdose. Another paper, published this year in The International Journal of Drug Policy, found that 30 percent of the 271 respondents reported that they used marijuana as a substitute for opiates. (But the researchers noted that the sample could be unrepresentative and that it was not known if marijuana provided a partial or total substitute for other drugs, and how much other drug use was displaced.) More concrete and direct evidence has been hard to gather given that marijuana is still seen as a   Schedule 1 drug by the federal government, which severely limits availability of funding for studies on humans. Amanda Reiman, a   expert and lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, called the lack of such studies â\\x80\\x9ca huge barrier. â\\x80\\x9d She said that the dearth of evidence argues not just for further study, but for pushing ahead with clinics like High Sobriety. Her main point is that opiates and other addictive drugs kill people so why not make every effort to find a better way. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no scientific reason to believe that somebody is better off being completely miserable and sober than using cannabis occasionally, or even fairly regularly, as an adult and being functional and happy and productive,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. Reiman, an unpaid consultant with High Sobriety, who added, â\\x80\\x9cUsing cannabis is a relatively safe practice. â\\x80\\x9d The   and main investor in High Sobriety, Michael Welch, is a recovering heroin addict who was helped by a traditional,   program. He also   and operates several    rehabilitation clinics that have a total of 100 beds. (Charges range from $25, 000 to $80, 000 a month for a private room). â\\x80\\x9cEvery single treatment center knows it, and we know it,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 Mr. Welch said. â\\x80\\x9cSome of us have had the same clients, five, 10, 15 times over. We say: â\\x80\\x98We just canâ\\x80\\x99t reach Billy, we just canâ\\x80\\x99t reach Joe. â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Why not, he said, try marijuana to help take the edge off for clients who â\\x80\\x9ccanâ\\x80\\x99t face the emotional thresholdâ\\x80\\x9d of abstinence. â\\x80\\x9cPeople are dying,â\\x80\\x9d he said. His   Joe Schrank, argued that marijuana will not kill patients as opiates do. But it does help clients sleep, relax and develop an appetite. The drug, he said, gives addicts some sense of emotional control. High Sobrietyâ\\x80\\x99s first inpatient was Mr. Michaud, who shared his story in February and it seems tailor made to test their hypothesis. A military brat who moved around, he said he felt traumatized when his homosexuality surfaced as a child and he was told in places like Kansas and South Carolina that he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t gay but suffering from various mental disorders.   led to   until his life, he said, was a cocktail party of morphine, heroin and pills. His mother, Kristen Michaud, said that over the years she sent him to half a dozen programs, several of them more than once, and spent more than $300, 000. But so far he has stayed the course at High Sobriety, which Mr. Schrank attributed to the availability of marijuana. â\\x80\\x9cIf this kid doesnâ\\x80\\x99t get cannabis, heâ\\x80\\x99s a goner,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Schrank, himself a recovering addict who previously founded and ran a clinic in Brooklyn. â\\x80\\x9cIf it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t for cannabis, heâ\\x80\\x99d have bolted in the middle of the night. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " \"Shawn Helton 21st Century WireAnother shocking active-shooter incident rocks America. This time, according to Florida s Broward County Sheriff s Department, thirteen people were shot, including five dead, after an apparent shooting rampage took place at Fort Lauderdale s Hollywood International Airport yesterday.At the moment, there is still no clear motive for the shooting attack and no evidence linking the suspect to terror. However, officials have yet to rule out the possibility of terrorism.The timing of this shooting attack cannot be overstated, as there was a major US intelligence review over an alleged Russian hack influence on America s 2016 election that was scheduled on the very same day   KNOWN WOLF?    What really happened at the Fort Lauderdale airport? (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)NOTE: It only took a matter of hours for the Fort Lauderdale shooter s back story to emerge.According to authorities, the suspected airport shooter, 26-year-old Esteban Santiago-Ruiz, checked a declared handgun inside his luggage, later retrieving it at Fort Lauderdale Airport s Terminal 2 baggage claim. Santiago then reportedly loaded the gun in a bathroom came out in the terminal opening fire on fellow travelers   including a series of head shots.After the shooting spree, the suspect was reported to have calmly turned himself into the police.#Florida #BreakingNews #FLLSHOOTING Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport #Shooting#Warleak pic.twitter.com/XkU79MTx1J  WarLeak (@WarLeak) January 6, 2017According to Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel,  The shooter is in custody and unharmed,  said .

No record he flew Air Canada? Only 2 cops escort away? Friday aftrn standard Dem fake news time pic.twitter.com/8qpi4tnGwL  NeuroTrade (@neurotrade) January 6, 2017The whole series of events is strange to say the least, but the oddities didn t stop there. Santiago-Ruiz s US military background includes service in the Puerto Rico Army National Guard in 2007, according to the Department of Defense. Santiago-Ruiz was listed as a combat engineer who had been deployed to Iraq in April 2010, returning to US soil in 2011. Later in November of 2014, following a move to Alaska, he became a member of the Alaska National Guard. In August of 2016, Santiago-Ruiz was transferred to Inactive Ready Reserve.Additionally, Santiago-Ruiz was stated to be employed by an as of yet unnamed Anchorage security company while living in Alaska.According to the Associated Press and Miami s local CBS News affiliate,  The Pentagon said he [Santiago-Ruiz] went AWOL several times as a specialist during a stint with the Alaska National Guard and was demoted to private first class, the Associated Press reported. He was given a general discharge, which is lower than an honorable discharge. Earlier reports stated that Santiago-Ruiz flew on a flight from Canada. Air Canada promptly denied that the suspected airport shooter was on any of their flights. Other US mainstream outlets later stated that he arrived on an in-bound Delta Airlines flight instead.  AIRPORT SHOOTING     Esteban Santiago is in custody following a shooting at a Fort Lauderdale airport. Authorities gathered travelers on the tarmac after the incident. (Image Source: Chicago Tribune)Interestingly, former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was on the scene of the shooting, and was  live-tweeting :I'm at the Ft. Lauderdale Airport. Shots have been fired.  Everyone is running.  Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 6, 2017Another Known Wolf?As 21 WIRE has documented over the years, many so-called shooting/terror/attacks involve individuals being monitored by security services prior to an alleged act taking place. A place where a  lone wolf  graduates into the ranks of a known wolf. In fact, very often those being watched by authorities exhibit all the tell-tale signs of a patsy or an informant, working either for a law enforcement or intelligence agency. Historically, government operators have often made use of low-life criminals, and mentally disturbed individuals to fulfill various role in entrapment stings or sometimes as bonafide actors in an actual attacks.  In any case, alleged attackers and security agencies have a dicey relationship, making any link between them highly suspect in nature.In January of 2015, a strategic security service think-tank known as The Soufan Group, reported that a larger national security threat resides with radicals who ve had a lengthy criminal background with known ties to security agencies: The Soufan Group, a New York think tank, said a better term for  lone wolves  would be  known wolves , given how many are already known to Western intelligence agencies before they strike. These individuals, acting alone or in small groups   have been on the radar of various agencies and organisations, highlighting the difficulty of effectively monitoring and managing people at the nexus of criminality and terrorism,  it said in a report this week The Fort Lauderdale shooting story rapidly emerged out of corporate media halls looking to sell the public on the latest tragic shooting in America. The Hollywood International Airport shooting has elements of other high-profile shooting events in recent history, such as the TSA/LAX shooting, the the Tucson shooting, Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting, the San Bernardino shooting attack, the Chattanooga military base shooting siege, as well as the aspects of the Aurora theater shooting and the Grand theater shooting in Lafayette and many others.Is the Fort Lauderdale airport shooter another case of a known wolf   triggered into action?The apparent Fort Lauderdale airport shooter, Santiago-Ruiz, who is said to be Puerto Rican was born in New Jersey (living in Alaska), and was well-known to authorities, having recently undergone a mental health evaluation after allegedly visiting an FBI office in Alaska where he claimed he was under  CIA mind control,  with voices in his head telling him to join ISIS : They say last November, he walked into the FBI s office in Anchorage, Alaska, claiming that  his mind was being controlled by the CIA and that it was forcing him to join ISIS. He appeared agitated and incoherent, and made disjointed statements   and although he said he didn t wish to hurt anyone, agents were concerned by his erratic behavior and decided to call local authorities, a senior federal law enforcement official said.Local police took him to a local medical facility for evaluation, and the FBI closed its assessment of Santiago after conducting database reviews, interagency checks and interviews with family members, the official said. NEW: In Nov. 2016, FLL suspect walked into FBI office in Anchorage, claiming he was being forced to fight for ISIS, sources tell CBS News.  CBS News (@CBSNews) January 6, 2017Shades of the Manchurian Candidate?We re also told that the suspect s aunt had flagged his mentally unstable condition previously. According to USA Today:Yet the troubling episode is now part of an emerging profile of a deeply disturbed man described by his aunt Friday as someone who had  lost his mind. Maria Luisa Ruiz of Union City, N.J., said her nephew, who had moved to Alaska for work as a security guard, only recently began to show signs of instability. Like a month ago, it was like he lost his mind,  she said He said he saw things. The inclusion of Santiago-Ruiz s alleged  voices  in his head, supposedly triggered by the CIA, immediately recalls another bizarre case that was also difficult to comprehend   the Navy Yard Shooter from 2013.Here s a passage from a 21WIRE report discussing the apparent Navy Yard shooter, Aaron Alexis: Rather than get caught up in the  fear campaigns  sold to us by our favorite news anchor-zombies, its important to consider another aspect of these mass shootings by making a tally of  the trigger points that media uses to manipulate public perception, as they carefully propagandize certain elements within a crisis making sure to illicit  the right  reaction from every major demographic. Is this what we are seeing in the aftermath of the Fort Lauderdale shooting?Heavy.com added the following details about the supposedly troubled Santiago-Ruiz:The shooter   whose troubled behavior had already drawn the attention of the FBI, Army, and Anchorage police   arrived Friday afternoon at the busy airport on a flight from Alaska, with the gun used in the shooting properly stored in his checked baggage, NBC News reports.One report said the shooter, who lived in Alaska, had no other luggage but the gun, which federal rules allow a person to declare at a ticket counter and check under the plane but not carry on. In addition to Santiago-Ruiz s lengthy time with the US military and the National Guard, in recent years, the suspected shooter was involved in various crimes. Here s a passage from The Daily Beast describing some of Santiago s background: According to charging documents provided by the Anchorage prosecutor s office to The Daily Beast, on January 10, 2016, Santiago verbally assaulted his then girlfriend, a 40-year old mother of one child from a previous marriage whom The Daily Beast is not naming, through a locked bathroom door, telling her to  Get the fuck out, bitch.  After he forced his way in by breaking down the door, he smacked her in the head and strangled her. By the time police arrived, Santiago had fled the scene.Santiago was arrested days later and released on the condition that he have no contact with the victim, but in February, Anchorage police found him at his girlfriend s residence and he was charged for violating the conditions of his release. That case is still pending.Alaska court records show a criminal record under Santiago s name for minor traffic infractions including operating a vehicle without insurance and a broken taillight. Records also show his landlord evicted him for non-payment of rent in February 2015.The assault case was resolved in March when Santiago entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, an alternative to adjudication where prosecutors agreed to dismiss the charges in exchange for Esteban s completion of requirements, the details of which are unknown. While Anchorage municipal prosecutor Seneca Theno told The Daily Beast that previous charges against Santiago-Ruiz are unlikely to be dropped following the airport shooting   you still have to wonder what  requirements  were asked of Santiago-Ruiz to get the alleged assault charges dropped from his record in the first place, given the brutal nature of them.FOX NEWS echoes a Sun Sentinel report,  Why the gunman may have chosen South Florida was unclear. He had no clear connection to the state aside from relatives in the Naples area, a two-hour drive away, the Sun Sentinel reported.The same FOX report adds the following about Santiago-Ruiz s alleged lengthy mental health battle: Bryan Santiago said his brother never spoke to him directly about his medical issues. We have not talked for the past three weeks,  Bryan Santiago said.  That s a bit unusual   I m in shock. He was a serious person   He was a normal person. Mass Shooting Distraction?Another aspect to these highly emotive and polarizing known wolf shooting events, is that usually they dominate US media coverage for several days. As other charged elements of an alleged shooter/attacker are propagandized, such as Santiago-Ruiz s Palestinian scarf image (seen on the left) seized upon by FOX News anchors who fused Santiago-Ruiz s allegedly  ISIS-like  hand gesture with the Gaza-Israeli conflict.The shocking scene at Fort Lauderdale s Hollywood International Airport occurred the same exact day US intelligence leaders briefed President-elect Donald Trump on so-called Russian hack allegations in the lead up to the 2016 election.Back in September of 2016, while examining the aftermath of the New York and New Jersey bomb plot/attack, we analyzed whether a deeper social engineering agenda might have been at play   as part of a larger geopolitical drama unfolded in Syria appeared to be masked by media.When looking deeper, we discovered other overlapping stories that coincided alongside the  known wolf  NYC bomber. Here s a passage that discussed the NYC attack that seemed to bury Western coverage regarding a vicious airstrike campaign that killed dozens of members of Syria s army: You have to wonder, were the events in New York and New Jersey also a weapon of mass distraction, following a major international embarrassment for the United States both at home and abroad   the brutal airstrike campaign in Syria that killed over 70 Syrian troops? This unlikely bombing incident just happened to also coincide with the UN General Assembly in NYC, where President Obama was delivering among other speeches, his War on Terror  addresses to the international community. No surprise then, with the city suddenly on  high terror alert    that Obama quickly, confidently and comfortably used his center stage spotlight at the UN, shifting into  national security  mode   boasting how quickly his police forces solved the case. It was almost if he was ready for events that weekend. Similarly, you have to consider if this new high-profile shooting event at Fort Lauderdale s Hollywood International Airport will dominate the news cycle, as the US intelligence community scrambles to prove Russian hack allegations over the next week.On January 4th ABC News reported the following: The classified report requested by President Barack Obama detailing Russia s alleged role in cyberattacks during U.S. presidential elections dating back to 2008 is now complete, and he is expected to receive the first briefing on its findings on Thursday afternoon, U.S. officials tell ABC News.President-elect Donald Trump, who said last week he would receive his briefing on the matter on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week, is scheduled to receive his briefing on Friday. Both briefings will be conducted by the heads of relevant agencies, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency, the FBI and the CIA.U.S. officials denied claims from Trump that his special briefing was delayed so the U.S. intelligence community could strengthen its case against Russia. Officials instead said there may have been a scheduling disconnect or some confusion on the part of the Trump transition team. Interestingly, other explosive high-profile stories went to the back burner, such as the Chicago kidnapping and teen torture story  and the fallout from CNN s Don Lemon following his egregious comments after the tragic racially motivated attack.Media Memory: Reports of a  Second Shooter  at Terminal 1During the later hours of the US mainstream media coverage, networks like CNN were still floating the possibility of a second shooter, as reports emerged of shots fired in the adjacent terminal housing United Airlines, Terminal 1.Interestingly, local reports also reported eye-witness accounts of a  second gunman  involved in the Fort Lauderdale shooting. Here s a passage from an ABC News affiliate discussing the reports of a second gunman at the Fort Lauderdale shooting: All day I ve heard people talking about second incidences,  Catie Rutledge wrote on Instagram.  After waiting on the tarmac for hours and hunting someone down to get our bags, we are now waiting for a bus, so that we can leave the airport. There was panic when authorities feared there was a second gunman. Law enforcement asked travelers to seek shelter. Fear prompted many to say their final good byes to loved ones. Some frightened parents were in tears as they tried to protect their children. This aspect of the case seemingly disappeared from media outlets following Santiago-Ruiz s arrest.The phenomena of multiple shooters being immediately reported after an apparent mass shooting event was also echoed during both the Orlando nightclub shooting and the San Bernardino attack in 2015.Later in the evening, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel confirmed that there was no second shooter   despite previous reports. The suspect was being interrogated by the FBI. This statement was in stark contrast to multiple witness statements made on national TV, placing the series of shots, or perhaps an additional series of shots and subsequent crowds fleeing in panic at Terminal 1  that would either be instead of Terminal 2, or in addition to it. This wasn t just an anomaly   this was backed up by at least 2 different witnesses on CNN, perhaps more in other reports which 21WIRE has yet to collate here.Was this a case of something that happened in Terminal 1  either part of a drill, or another gunman   which was memory-holed by the media and DHS, or could this be we are looking at planted witnesses who got their lines wrong? This is a fair question to ask, considering we are talking about multiple witnesses stating the shots and crowds panicking in Terminals other than the official story in Terminal 2.Here are four alternative witnesses:Witness 1: CNN s coverage of the  Active Shooter  festival at Fort Lauderdale Airport reveals yet another anomaly in their story. CNN reported the alleged shooter, Esteban Santiago, shot 5 people dead in the Delta Terminal 2, and yet, all the witnesses reported 4 shots fired in the United Terminal 1. When this witness, a father who flew in from Chicago, tells of the United T1 shots fired, CNN s reporter Boris Sanchez appears to panic, possibly then receiving a feed in his ear and then essentially tells the witness  you are wrong, there were no shots fired in United Terminal 1.  Was this bad reporting, or bad stage management by CNN? Watch:  Witness 2: Immediately after CNN s Boris Sanchez mix-up with man flying in from Chicago at United Terminal 1, another CNN witness was suddenly produced, going by the name of  Ryan Ward , interviewed by Jim Sciutto, then comes on, using very scripted language apparently in an attempt to clean-up the inconsistent statements of the last witness. Ryan Ward describes the mayhem, people running,  luggage flying  and  people screaming, gunman coming    even though he admits he was NOT in Delta Terminal 2 where police report the actual shooting took place. Ward claims he was in a wheel chair because of back surgery, but then claims he  got up and ran over  to save a little girl and  I ran back over and pushed the mom into a corner and laid on top of her . He then says that,  It does sound like it was an unsubstantiated second threat, but people certainly weren t acting like it    here he was mirroring the identical language used by the previous CNN reporters. Coincidence? Even more oddly, Ward claims he was flying Jet Blue, and that the,  Jet Blue staff were really great    only problem is that Jet Blue is in Terminal 3, and not in T1 or T2. Watch: Witness 3: Another witness, testifying multiple gunman on the scene, although the Terminal location being referenced by this 3rd witness is somewhat unclear:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBhiSblZtJs . Also, there is an additional media report by Intellihub of a pilot, in uniform and on-site, who also testifies about a loud commotion, with police in pursuit of a perpetrator seen in Terminal 1   a stark contrast to the official story: The pilot believes that  there was another shooting  in Terminal 1 that law enforcement and the F.B.I. are likely covering up.  I could hear females screaming and people running away from terminal 1. The pilot said he feels that it was definitely  some kind of combined effort to attack  the airport.In addition to that, here is a fifth witness, seen in this unconfirmed cell phone video from a female passenger out on the airport tarmac   apparently from Terminal 1, and referencing a second shooter event located after the TSA barrier   which seems to be a different location to the baggage check area:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tayCW0pTBF8 . EDITORS NOTE: If readers have any other witness reports of a  Second Shooter  or shots fired in Terminal 2, please leave them below in the comment section.Here s an ABC News feature with Mark Lea, an apparent eye-witness (later photographed the crime scene) who came  face-to-face  with Santiago-Ruiz   who also rather incredibly, managed to not get shot during the encounter Fort Lauderdale s  Active Shooter  DrillsVery often preceding an apparent shooting/attack there is the presence of mass casualty drills. Fort Lauderdale was no exception.In 2015, the Sun Sentinel reported the following: At a Fort Lauderdale cinema Wednesday, two men in camouflage gear calmly walked down the aisle and fired rifles and handguns at moviegoers.Twenty-seven volunteers were  injured  in three theaters during the drill.Fort Lauderdale police guarded and escorted paramedics wearing protective gear to tend to the wounded actors, even though the  shooters  weren t captured and blank gunfire echoed elsewhere in the Riverwalk movie complex.The agencies  goal is to speed up paramedics  responses during mass killings, domestic calls and other violent incidents. Similarly, in June of 2016, an inter-agency meeting described future protocols regarding mass drills: The meeting, held every quarter, is an opportunity for agencies to coordinate with one another and discuss the latest techniques in fighting domestic terror attacks.Last month, agencies participated in an active-shooter exercise at the Fort Lauderdale Postal Facility.In February, the group participated in Operation Heat Shield, consisting of weapons of mass destruction and an active shooting drill.Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward County Sheriff s Office and Sheriff Rick Bradshaw of Palm Beach County Sheriff s Office said these training exercises are important. With such a large law enforcement effort to tackle the active-shooter, you have to wonder why and how these events seem to coincide with major attacks on US soil.Here s a YouTube video from commentator Peekay Truth discussing aspects of this latest mass shooting tragedy in America https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYY0EgDRYgcDupes, Informants and PawnsAdditionally, as we ve mentioned before, during the aftermath of 2014 s Canadian Parliament Shooting in Ottawa, we outlined many of the primary markers used in certain terror related events globally and other mass casualty incidents often seen in America.The shocking event, like other bizarre attacks in recent years, have often distorted public opinion, pushing the populace towards new security measures in the wake of heavily coordinated and stylized crimes.The suspected Parliament Hill and National War Memorial shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, (Left Image: therightscoop) had the perfect  modus operandi  and r sum  to be an informant for either a law enforcement or intelligence agency.According to the Globe and Mail, Zehaf-Bibeau was already designated as a high risk traveller by the Canadian government s security services   who had also seized his passport. Was this the reason why the Zehaf-Bibeau snapped? Was he being targeted or being pressured into becoming an informant?Other terror stooges and suspicious intelligence  informant  cases include the following:Tamerlan Tsarnaev (see his story here) Buford Rogers (see his story here) Jerad Miller (see his story here) Naji Mansour (see his story here) Quazi Mohammad Nafis (see his story here) Mohamed Osman Mohamud (see his story here) Timothy McVeigh (see his story here) Salim Benghalem (see his story here) Michael Adebolajo (see his story here) Daba Deng (see his story here) Elton Simpson (see his story here) Man Haron Monis (see his story here) Abu Hamza (see his story here) Haroon Rashid Aswat (see his story here) Glen Rodgers (see his story here) Omar Mateen (see his story here) Tashfeen Malik (see her story here) Djamel Beghal  (see his story here) Anjem Choudary (see his story here) Cherif Kouachi (see his story here) Said Kouachi (see his story here) Amedy Coulibaly (see his story here) Hayat Boumeddiene (see her story here) Salah Abdeslam (see his story here) Michael Zehaf-Bibeau (see his story here) Nidal Malik Hassan (see his story here) Abdelhakim Dekhar  (see his story here) Abdelhamid Abaaoud (see his story here) Samy Amimour (see his story here) Isma l Omar Mostefa  (see his story here) Mohamed Lahouij Bouhlel (see his story here) Anis Amri (see his story here)As we ve mentioned here at 21WIRE before, many political leaders and media operatives bang the drums of security over so-called terror  sleeper cells hiding in a nation near you   none of them acknowledge the historical fact that they themselves have also helped to harbor, grow, foment and radicalize individuals through counter-terrorism operations for decades.It is important to mention again, that the FBI created the counter-intelligence program (COINTELPRO) to influence and disrupt political factions from the inside out. Between 1956 and 1971 (including the Socialist Workers party in 1973), the FBI s controversial program infiltrated and radicalized hundreds of left-wing and right-wing groups to control and neutralize political dissidents across America.As we stated after the suspicious Oregon campus shooting in 2015, mass media has worked out their own formula for laying out a familiar series of polarizing political points in the aftermath of any  tragic  event, as they have with many others incidents. The Fort Lauderdale shooting appears once again, to purposefully redirect the public to look at a ready-made laundry list of items (in this case mental-health, supported by online rants on social media) about the persona of a shooter as an ironclad motive for a crime. The aftermath in the case of Fort Lauderdale is no different, as it rapidly descended into an overindulgent barrage of media speculation and theorizing.All too often we ve seen the  stage persona of any alleged attacker or killer being touted as hard evidence, despite the fact that even strong circumstantial evidence of any apparent crime would likely result in many hours of analysis and debate, potentially without a definitive conclusion, even if the evidence reaches a court room.For the average person, it s hard to differentiate from a drill or a real event, causing one to scrutinize the legitimacy of such an operation.In recent years, the investigative tactics of various intelligence agencies have come into question, none perhaps more dubious than the Newburgh FBI sting that involved entrapping four men to participate in a fabricated event created by the bureau. Here s a 2011 passage from The Guardian describing how an FBI informant named Shahed Hussain coerced four others into a fake terror plot: The  Newburgh Four  now languish in jail. Hussain does not. For Hussain was a fake. In fact, Hussain worked for the FBI as an informant trawling mosques in hope of picking up radicals.Yet far from being active militants, the four men he attracted were impoverished individuals struggling with Newburgh s grim epidemic of crack, drug crime and poverty. One had mental issues so severe his apartment contained bottles of his own urine. He also believed Florida was a foreign country.Hussain offered the men huge financial inducements to carry out the plot   including $250,000 to one man   and free holidays and expensive cars.As defence lawyers poured through the evidence, the Newburgh Four came to represent the most extreme form of a controversial FBI policy to use invented terrorist plots to lure targets.  There has been no case as egregious as this. It is unique in the incentive the government provided. A quarter million dollars?  said Professor Karen Greenberg, a terrorism expert at Fordham University. The whole episode seemed akin to the WTC 1993 bombing case, which involved yet another informant working alongside officials.The Gun Control & Security AgendaAs pointed out in 21WIRE during 2015 s Oregon campus shooting, the primary focus for mass media concerning the Fort Lauderdale incident, will now be all of the hot button socio-political issues including  gun control-reform  and those concerned over  mental illness  background checks, along with those who constitutionally oppose such restrictive legislation.It should be obvious by now that events like Fort Lauderdale, along with other  mass-shootings , have become a sharp catalyst to usher in calls for endless new  mass shooting  protocols, inter-agency  fusion ,  first-responder  emergency medical protocols, and also for injecting more and more military terminology into civilian life   with the media playing a critical role in steering the public away from questioning any of the dubious elements surrounding any shooting event.In a sense, the media is helping to nudge these shooting events out of the forensic sphere and into the political arena as quickly as possible, effectively closing the feedback loop of concerned citizens and those who may have been affected by an event.The Fort Lauderdale shooting has prompted the mainstream media to feed into concerns over airport security, gun ownership and a persons mental health background. All of media s fear-inducing drama regarding the Fort Lauderdale shooting boils down to a contentious battle over gun reform and mental health as the Obama administration comes to a close. No doubt this latest shooting will give cause to new security measures in airports across America.Here s another look at outgoing President Obama discussing his frustration on gun control in a  legacy  interview with the BBC from 2015   amazingly, only a few hours before a mass shooting in Lafayette *UPDATE*  Broward Sheriff Scott Israel stated that deputies arrived on the scene between  60 to 70 seconds  after the Fort Lauderdale shooting took place   quite an incredible response time by most law enforcement standards.TMZ acquired footage of the Fort Lauderdale shooter in action   the video appears to display elements of staging   decide for yourself According to reports,  Airport officials, along with federal and local authorities, are investigating who had access to the footage and who allowed it to be taped without authorization, Broward Mayor Barbara Sharief told the Sun Sentinel. *UPDATE* Just one week prior to the Fort Lauderdale shooting,  Florida lawmakers began rallying support for SB 140, a state bill that would repeal laws which, among other things, ban guns in airport terminals like the one where the shooting occurred.

       " 'Officials in El Salvador held emergency meetings after seeing a sharp increase in the number of violent gang members being deported back to the country from the United States under the Trump administration. [Salvadoran authorities have held emergency meetings and proposed new legislation to monitor returning criminals and gang members that are returning to El Salvador after deportation, according to the Washington Post.  The move by Salvadoran officials comes as a direct result of the Trump administrationâ\\x80\\x99s crackdown on illegal immigration and efforts to deport more criminal illegal aliens from the U. S. This year the U. S. has already deported 398 gang members back to El Salvador  â\\x80\\x94   compared to only 534 for all of 2016. It is due to this rapid increase in deportations that Salvadoran officials like HÃ©ctor Antonio RodrÃ\\xadguez, the director of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s immigration agency, are worried about the impact the returning gang members will have in the country. â\\x80\\x9cThis clearly affects El Salvador. We already have a climate of violence in the country that we are combating,â\\x80\\x9d RodrÃ\\xadguez said. â\\x80\\x9cIf gang members return, of course this worries us. â\\x80\\x9d Many of the returning gang members belong to   a notoriously violent street gang that has plagued communities throughout the U. S. with horrific acts of violence. Although   started out in Salvadoran communities in Los Angeles sometime during the 1980â\\x80\\x99s, lax immigration policies and weak border security helped the gang explode in size as   originated from illegal immigrants, Breitbart Texas reported. The recent murders of four teens in New York City have put   in the national spotlight with Attorney General Jeff Sessions declaring that U. S. authorities are going after the gang. â\\x80\\x9cThe   motto is kill, rape, and control,â\\x80\\x9d Sessions said. â\\x80\\x9cI have a message to the gangs that are targeting our young people: We are targeting you. We are coming after you. â\\x80\\x9d Speaking at a rally in April, President Trump highlighted the importance of removing illegal alien   gang members from the U. S.: At the heart of my administrationâ\\x80\\x99s efforts to restore the rule of law has been a nationwide crackdown on criminal gangs, and that means taking the fight to the sanctuary cities that shield these dangerous criminals from removal. The last very weak administration allowed thousands and thousands of gang members to cross our borders and enter into our communities, where they wreaked havoc on our citizens. The bloodthirsty cartel known as   has infiltrated our schools, threatening innocent children. We have seen the horrible assaults and many killings all along Long Island where I grew up. We are seeing the vicious spread of transnational gangs into all 50 states and the human suffering they bring with them. I have been with the parents. It is devastation. A very respected General recently told me that   are the equivalent in their meanness to Al Qaeda. My administration will not rest until we have dismantled these violent gangs, and we are doing it rapidly, and we are sending them the hell out of our country. On Wednesday, Breitbart Texas reported that Sen. Ron Johnson ( ) Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said recently obtained documents from a whistleblower show that the Obama administration knowingly admitted 16   gang members in 2014.

       " 'WIMBLEDON, England  â\\x80\\x94   The    Kingdom clearly has bigger concerns than a mere tennis tournament, with the focus on the countryâ\\x80\\x99s leaving the European Union and on Englandâ\\x80\\x99s remaining in soccerâ\\x80\\x99s European Championships. Itâ\\x80\\x99s rather strange how that timing has worked out. But no matter what is transpiring in the wider, less orderly world, there is still plenty to play for in the bubble of Wimbledon, where the grass  â\\x80\\x94   at least on Henman Hill  â\\x80\\x94   looks even greener than usual this year. On the eve of the tournament on Sunday, the defending champions Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams spoke    in the interview room at the All England Club. Neither has played an official event since the French Open. Both sat with their hands folded in front of them. Both spoke more softly and slowly than usual, but only Williams seemed subdued, keeping her answers terse, even to questions that lent themselves to rambling on, and not so subtly checking her watch as the allotted 15 minutes neared an end. She has had a fine season by nearly anyone elseâ\\x80\\x99s standards, reaching the finals at the Australian Open and the French Open and remaining No. 1 in the rankings. But it has definitely been a downbeat year for her, with upset losses to Angelique Kerber in Melbourne and to GarbiÃ±e Muguruza in Paris. Williamsâ\\x80\\x99s mood on Sunday could be taken two different ways: One, she is still reeling, or two (and much more likely) she is simmering and much more interested in crushing serves and returns and restoring the tennis universe to its natural order than in the    game. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m definitely ready to start playing at this point,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m kind of over practicing every day for two hours, then going to the gym. â\\x80\\x9d When she won here last year, Williams held all four of the Grand Slam singles titles. Now she holds only Wimbledonâ\\x80\\x99s. Djokovic, her dancing partner at last yearâ\\x80\\x99s champions dinner, is the one on the   roll now. Heâ\\x80\\x99s the first man to hold all four major titles since Rod Laver in 1969 and the player with a chance to do what Williams could not quite manage last year by completing the Grand Slam and winning all four majors in the same calendar year. I asked Williams what she might tell Djokovic after her unsuccessful chase last year, which ended two rounds short of the Grand Slam when she was stunned in the United States Open semifinals by Roberta Vinci. â\\x80\\x9cYou know, he has every opportunity to do it,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cI think heâ\\x80\\x99ll get it easy, so he should be fine. â\\x80\\x9d Easy sounds unlikely, given the pressure and fatigue that will surely build up in a year that also features the Olympics. Less than an hour after Djokovic won the French Open this month for his first Roland Garros title, the former star Henri Leconte walked past the Djokovic camp in the playersâ\\x80\\x99 lounge and said theatrically: â\\x80\\x9cTwo to go! Two to go! Oh, my God! Two to go!â\\x80\\x9d Marian Vajda, one of Djokovicâ\\x80\\x99s coaches, laughed. This was Leconte, one of tennisâ\\x80\\x99s class clowns, after all. Vajda, in typical fashion, then acknowledged the reality. â\\x80\\x9cReal Grand Slam, now we can think about it,â\\x80\\x9d Vajda said. â\\x80\\x9cThis was a real mental breakthrough for Novak, to win in Paris. And now he needs to focus on going to Wimbledon fresh and going for the U. S. Open, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s obviously the Olympic Games in the middle, so itâ\\x80\\x99s too many goals in a row. It makes it more complicated. â\\x80\\x9d More compelling, too, and all the more so because Djokovic surely never gave the Grand Slam too much serious thought earlier in his career. He was too preoccupied with leveling the playing field with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to think about outclassing the field to this degree. Even Djokovicâ\\x80\\x99s biggest supporters  â\\x80\\x94   his family  â\\x80\\x94   were not thinking about it. Vajda said he ran into Djokovicâ\\x80\\x99s father, Srdjan, at a restaurant in Paris during the French Open. Srdjan was with a group of friends and asked Vajda to tell the group what Srdjan had told him when they first met. â\\x80\\x9cYou told me he will be No. 1,â\\x80\\x9d Vajda replied, â\\x80\\x9cand I started laughing because I thought you were joking with me. And Novakâ\\x80\\x99s father said: â\\x80\\x98No, I was not joking. I knew he was going to be No. 1, knew it, but I forgot one thing. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know he would be dominating so much in the tennis world one day.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9d But here Djokovic is, undoubtedly the worldâ\\x80\\x99s top player on all surfaces, with a   record against the top 10 during the past two seasons. He has done it, in part, by learning how to conserve his physical and emotional energy  â\\x80\\x94   unplugging from the game when necessary, which he did again before Wimbledon. â\\x80\\x9cWinning Roland Garros was obviously one of the most memorable and beautiful moments of my career,â\\x80\\x9d said Djokovic, who will face James Ward of Britain in the opening match on Centre Court on Monday. â\\x80\\x9cAlso, it took a lot out of me. I thought that itâ\\x80\\x99s more important for me to just rejuvenate and rest a little bit from tennis and then come back preparing for Wimbledon. â\\x80\\x9d He does not plan to overplay. Defend his title at Wimbledon, and it is entirely possible that he will play only the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and the United States Open in the two months that follow. But there are other temptations, including a Davis Cup quarterfinal versus Britain (and Andy Murray) in July and the Rogers Cup in Toronto, which could serve as a hardcourt   for Rio. The Grand Slam is such a rare prize that it bears sacrificing other worthy goals, as Williams is better placed than anyone to grasp. She has not been the same irresistible force since that loss to Vinci in September, and Wimbledon is full of ghosts as well as big victories for her. Not that she remembers them all. On Sunday, she could not recall any of the details of her first appearance in 1998 (she retired in the third round versus Virginia Ruano Pascual of Spain). But she surely remembers losing to Sabine Lisicki in the fourth round in 2013 and to AlizÃ© Cornet in the third round in 2014, just as she surely remembers beating Muguruza in straight sets last year to win her sixth Wimbledon singles title. â\\x80\\x9cThis year, I donâ\\x80\\x99t feel as much tension as I usually do,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cWell, thereâ\\x80\\x99s some years that I havenâ\\x80\\x99t felt any tension, either. Iâ\\x80\\x99m feeling pretty good. I donâ\\x80\\x99t feel any pressure or stress. â\\x80\\x9d In truth, it was a challenge to sense what Williams was feeling on Sunday, and she will now let her racket do the talking, beginning with her   match on Tuesday versus Amra Sadikovic of Switzerland, 27, who retired in May 2014 but is now back for more and making her Grand Slam debut. Williams, at 34, knows too well that life is full of such surprises, and surprise has been the rule of late in the womenâ\\x80\\x99s game, with the   Flavia Pennetta, Kerber and Muguruza winning the past three major titles. â\\x80\\x9cThink about how many women now know that they have an opening,â\\x80\\x9d said Pam Shriver, an ESPN analyst. â\\x80\\x9cDuring most of the Serena era, the players have felt there was no opening for them,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, â\\x80\\x9cso the question is, who is big enough to walk through it, especially at Wimbledon, where thereâ\\x80\\x99s more media and where you better have control of your breathing and know how to manage your nerves more than anywhere else? Because thereâ\\x80\\x99s a quietness and an aura about the place, and if youâ\\x80\\x99re not firmly planted with two feet with your confidence, it will knock you off balance. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'For most of the past two years, it looked like Bashar al-Assad\\'s campaign to hold on in Syria was working. Syria\\'s weak, uncoordinated, and increasingly Islamist rebels were being gradually pushed back. And while ISIS had seized vast parts of the country, it and Assad appeared to tolerate one another in a sort of tacit non-aggression pact designed to crush the Syrian rebels. It seemed that Syria, and the world, would be stuck with Assad\\'s murderous dictatorship for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nBut in the past few weeks, things appear to have changed â\\x80\\x94 potentially dramatically. The rebels have won a string of significant victories in the country\\'s north. Assad\\'s troop reserves are wearing thin, and it\\'s becoming harder for him to replace his losses.\\n\\nA rebel victory, to be clear, is far from imminent or even likely. At this point, it\\'s too early to say for sure what this means for the course of the Syrian war. But the rebels have found a new momentum against Assad just as his military strength could be weakening, which could be a significant change in the trajectory of a war that has been ongoing for years.\\n\\nBashar al-Assad\\'s forces are losing ground against the rebels, for example in northern Idlib province, where two recent rebel victories show how strong the rebels have gotten. First, in late March, Assad\\'s forces were pushed out of Idlib City, the region\\'s capital. Second, in late April, rebels took Jisr al-Shughour, a strategically valuable town that lies on the Assad regime\\'s supply line in the area and near its important coastal holdings.\\n\\n\"Jisr al-Shughour is a good example of how the regime is, indeed, losing ground,\" Noah Bonsey, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, told me. \"Most observers were surprised at how quickly it fell, given that it is a town of some strategic importance.\"\\n\\nWhile rebels\\' most dramatic victories are in Idlib, they\\'re advancing elsewhere as well. They\\'ve seized towns in the south and have repelled Assad offensives around the country.\\n\\n\"Losses in Idlib and the southern governorate of Deraa have placed great pressure on Assad,\"Â\\xa0Charles Lister, a fellow at the Brookings Doha Center, writes. \"Frustration, disaffection and even incidences of protest are rising across Assadâ\\x80\\x99s most ardent areas of support on Syriaâ\\x80\\x99s coast â\\x80\\x94 some of which are now under direct attack.\"\\n\\nBonsey concurs. \"Rebels have seized momentum in recent weeks and months,\" he says. \"The regime is clearly weakening to an extent that was not widely reflected in the English-language narrative surrounding the conflict.\"\\n\\nRecent regime defeats reflect growing unity among the rebels as well as fundamental weaknesses on the regime\\'s side.\\n\\nThe Idlib advance, in particular, was led by Jaish al-Fatah, a new rebel coalition led by several different Islamist groups. While the coalition includes Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda\\'s Syrian franchise, the jihadis don\\'t appear to dominate the group.\\n\\n\"The operations also displayed a far improved level of coordination between rival factions,\" Lister writes, \"spanning from U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) brigades, to moderate and conservative Syrian Islamists, to al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra and several independent jihadist factions.\"\\n\\nRebel coordination is nothing new in Syria. But this coalition stands out for its size and breadth.\\n\\n\"The number of fighters mobilized for the initial Idlib city campaign has been significant, and that\\'s been just as true in subsequent operations in the north,\" Bonsey says. \"The level of coordination we\\'ve seen over several weeks, on multiple fronts, is something that we have rarely, if ever, seen from rebels in the north.\"\\n\\nAnd as the rebels have gotten more united, the regime has gotten weaker. The basic problem is attrition: Assad is losing a lot of soldiers in this war, and his regime â\\x80\\x94 a sectarian Shia government in an overwhelmingly Sunni country â\\x80\\x94 can\\'t train replacements quickly enough.\\n\\nBonsey calls this an \"unsolvable manpower problem.\" As a result, he says, Assad is becoming increasingly dependent on his foreign allies â\\x80\\x94 Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah specifically â\\x80\\x94 to lead the ground campaign.\\n\\nBut Iran has shown limited willingness to commit heavily to areas like Idlib, and rather is concentrating principally on defending the regime\\'s core holdings around Damascus and the coast. According to Bonsey, \"it\\'s a matter of priorities,\" which is to say that their resources aren\\'t unlimited, and they\\'ve (so far) preferred to concentrate them in the most critical areas.\\n\\nIran\\'s involvement in conflicts in Iraq and Yemen on top of Syria has left it \"really overstretched,\" according to Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. The cumulative resource investment has \"certainly had an impact on Assad losing territory in Syria,\" he concludes.\\n\\n\"For the regime, the status quo militarily is not sustainable,\" Bonsey says, and \"Iran\\'s strategy in Syria does not appear sustainable. The costs to Iran of propping up Assad\\'s rule in Syria are only going to rise with time, substantially. And what\\'s happened with Idlib in recent weeks is only the latest indication of that.\"\\n\\nBonsey, like most Syria experts, does not believe Assad is on the road to inevitable defeat.\\n\\n\"While much of the subsequent commentary [to the Idlib offensive] proclaimed this as the beginning of the end for President Bashar al-Assadâ\\x80\\x99s regime, we are still a long way from that,\" Lister writes.\\n\\nFor one thing, Iran sees the survival of the Assad regime as a critical strategic priority, as it allows Iran to supply Hezbollah and maintain a close ally in the Levant. Any post-Assad government is likely to be Sunni-dominated,and quite hostile to Iran. Tehran is probably willing to go to some lengths to keep that from happening, and Iranian intervention in the war has been a significant force.\\n\\n\"In strict military terms, there isn\\'t yet a direct threat on the strategically essential territory that the regime and its backers continue to control,\" Bonsey says, \"and there isn\\'t yet a reason to think the rebels are capable of threatening\" such a region.\\n\\nSince Assad can\\'t crush the rebels in their strongholds, then, the conflict is looking a lot like a stalemate â\\x80\\x94 which it already was before this rebel offensive began.\\n\\nMoreover, the unity of this new rebel coalition could collapse. The broad alliance we\\'ve seen in Idlib is held together by victory: the more they push back Assad, the more willing they are to cooperate. But if Assad\\'s forces start beating them, the ideological and political fault lines in the coalition could cause rebel groups to turn on one another. It\\'s happened â\\x80\\x94 many times â\\x80\\x94 before.\\n\\nThe \"big question now,\" according to Bonsey, is \"how the regime and its backers choose to respond to these defeats.\" A major decider, in other words, is Iran. But as long as they see protecting the Assad regime as vital, they are likely to do what it takes to keep his core territory intact.',\n",

       " '(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s administration on Sunday: Trump ramps up his criticism of a federal judge who blocked a travel ban on seven mainly Muslim nations and says courts were making U.S. border security harder, intensifying the first major legal battle of his presidency. Many of those caught up in Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s travel ban last weekend took advantage of a federal judgeâ\\x80\\x99s order temporarily suspending the order to complete their disrupted journeys to the United States. Trump faces an uphill battle to overcome a federal judgeâ\\x80\\x99s temporary hold on his travel ban, but the outcome of a ruling on the executive orderâ\\x80\\x99s ultimate legality is less certain, experts say Several technology companies plan to send a letter Trump on Monday urging his administration to follow through on proposed changes to the travel ban, sources familiar with the letter say. Washington stateâ\\x80\\x99s lawsuit challenging Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s executive order on immigration emerged out of a chaotic, 48-hour period in which the need for immediate action held sway over the kind of carefully thought-out strategizing that usually leads up to the filing of a major legal complaint, according to state Attorney General Bob Ferguson and other attorneys involved in actions against the order. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel says he was reassured after meetings last week with top U.S. officials that the United States is committed to a united Europe and to the NATO alliance. Despite declarations of unity at a recent European Union summit in Malta, EU countries are split on how to respond to policies from Trump, who has reversed staunch postwar U.S. support for European integration and suggested others follow Britain out of a bloc he has called â\\x80\\x9ca vehicle for Germany.â\\x80\\x9d Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s first two weeks in office have left some European politicians leaders aghast but are drawing cheers from Franceâ\\x80\\x99s far-right National Front, as its leader, Marine Le Pen, launches her own bid for power. The governor of Colorado says he believes the Cuban government wants to further improve relations with the United States under Trump, as he wraps up a three-day visit to the Communist-run island nation. Trump says in remarks broadcast on Sunday that he would put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of a commission to probe what he believes was voter fraud in last Novemberâ\\x80\\x99s election. ',\n",
       " 'SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc, Alphabet Incâ\\x80\\x99s Google and Facebook Inc are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U.S. President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s controversial travel ban, deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order. A legal brief filed in federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed the support of 58 companies, less than half the 127 signatories to a similar brief filed in an appeals court last month after Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s first executive order banning travel from a number of countries the administration said posed a security risk. Airbnb Inc, Dropbox Inc and Kickstarter are among the companies that did sign the brief.  Major tech companies that signed on to the earlier effort but not this week included Microsoft Corp, eBay Inc, Intel Corp, Netflix Inc and Twitter Inc. The lawsuit may succeed despite losing the overt support of such big names. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu on Wednesday ordered an emergency halt to Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s executive order that aimed to temporarily bar entry to the United States of most refugees as well as travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The halt is temporary.  Trump says the ban is necessary for U.S. national security, and called Watsonâ\\x80\\x99s order â\\x80\\x9cunprecedented judicial overreach.â\\x80\\x9d Tech companies, which generally rely on skilled workers from overseas more than other industries, played a large part in the legal effort to halt the first version of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s executive order, which was put on hold by a Seattle judge in early February.  It was not immediately clear why fewer of them signed on to the â\\x80\\x9cfriend-of-the-courtâ\\x80\\x9d brief this time around.  Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. â\\x80\\x9cWe do expect the group to expand.â\\x80\\x9d  Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc was in the process of adding its name, a spokesman said.  Box Inc, a file-sharing service, said that although it did not sign the brief, there had been no change to its position. A Twitter spokeswoman pointed to past company statements opposing Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s initial travel ban in January but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment.  Representatives of Apple, Google, eBay, Intel, Microsoft and Netflix did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ',\n",
       " 'German police are said to have uncovered evidence of a plot to carry out chemical attacks in British seaside towns while raiding a huge migrant camp. [The authorities were searching the camp for Christmas market killer Anis Amri, but the Tunisian migrant easily evaded his pursuers by taking advantage of the European Unionâ\\x80\\x99s borderless Schengen Area, travelling through several countries before being discovered by two Italian police officers in a random   . He shot and injured one of them in the ensuing gunfight, before being killed by rookie cop Luca ScatÃ\\xa0.

Democrats tried to do something about it, but Republicans, who are apparently with Trump till the very end, stopped them.House Democrats proposed an amendment that would strip Kushner of his security clearance. Republicans certainly have to be seeing the writing on the wall at this point   Trump and his crew (especially Kushner) are going down   but instead of using this opportunity to tell their constituents that they truly stand for law and order, Republicans are digging their heels and are prepared to go down with the ship (excuse the mixed metaphor). They blocked the amendment.Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who chaired the Democratic National Committee during much of last year s campaign cycle, proposed an amendment targeting Kushner during a House Appropriations Committee markup session Thursday. It was voted down, 22-30, along party lines.The measure would have barred the government from issuing or maintaining a security clearance for any White House individual  under a criminal investigation by a Federal law enforcement agency for aiding a foreign government. This amendment is an important step in protecting the American people from the threat of hostile foreign interference. That is not a controversial or a political goal,  Wasserman Schultz said during the hearing. Revoking Jared Kushner s security clearance would send a clear signal to anyone who would consider aiding and abetting a foreign enemy state to affect the outcome of a U.S. presidential election that they will not be entrusted with our nation s most sensitive information,  she added.Source: Huffington PostThis proves that Republicans have lost all claims to patriotism. They have put party and even Russia before country. That s okay, though. The Trump ship is sinking and Republicans who refuse to jump off will pay dearly at the polls.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'The Attorney representing the illegal aliens who were arrested alleges that, Other than drunken driving, and driving without a license, and entering the country illegally, they ve done nothing wrong LOL! The popular Aroma Buffet & Grill in York, Pennsylvania reopened Wednesday after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweep that nabbed several employees forced owners to close down.The restaurant s new manager, Kyle Lin, told the York Daily Record he was recently hired to run the place but he s not sure whether the former manager s role in hiring four kitchen employees who were arrested by ICE agents two weeks ago. I m not sure if the previous manager hired them or knew of their proper status, or if those employees provided false information,  Lin said.Attorney Stephen Converse is representing the four employees   all men in their 20s   who were in the country illegally from Guatemala, Mexico and El Salvador.Converse would not identify his clients, but told the news site they re not serious criminals. He alleges that other than drunken driving, and driving without a license, and entering the country illegally, they ve done nothing wrong.Converse credited the Trump administration with removing them and numerous other illegal immigrants he is currently representing. The Obama administration very methodically focused on criminal aliens,  he told the Daily Record.  Now they re targeting everyone. The defense attorney said he s personally spoken with 16 illegal immigrants arrested by ICE agents in York County over the last three weeks, and contends another 14 were arrested in Carbon County.Converse also complained that local courts will no longer simply release illegal immigrants back into society as they await a hearing, and are now holding them for ICE.ICE officials would not discuss operations with the Daily Record, which cited a U.S. Department of Homeland Security statement that more than 680 illegal immigrants were arrested last month in large metropolitan cities.ICE field office director for greater Los Angeles, David Marin, told the Associated Press in mid-February that those sweeps were planned  before the (Trump) administration came out with their current executive orders  on immigration.

       " 'Rachel Maddow decided to scrap a segment and go off-script to warn her viewers about Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. Donald Trump has offered Flynn the position of National Security Advisor and the MSNBC host finds this revelation too worrying to put off discussing. At this point in the show, I had something else we were going to cover, but I scrapped it because there s a thing I feel like I need to say about the Mike Flynn security announcement,  Maddow said.Maddow explained that no one, such as Congress, has to approve this appointment in any way. Trump makes the offer and if Flynn accepts, then boom, it s a done deal. She then told America just why it is that this is such concerning news. So, this Mike Flynn thing is done,  Maddow explained.  But the choice of Mike Flynn is a different kettle of fish than anything we might have expected from the Trump campaign. Mike Flynn calls Islam a political ideology hiding behind a religion. He calls Islam a malignant cancer. He really did sit next to President Putin and take money to go to a gala. He s been a frequent guest on Russian state television, and says he sees no difference between Russian state television, and for example, MSNBC. After laying out her list of reasons why Flynn shouldn t be considered for any government position, let alone at the top of national security, Maddow explained to viewers what he will be doing in this position if he accepts it. He will now be the closest person to the president on a day-to-day basis on all foreign policy issues, on all military issues, on all national security issues, and he is way outside anything that anybody on the left, right or center might consider to be the mainstream, either in thought or temperament in terms of national security issues, and it s done,  Maddow said.Maddow laid out Flynn s shady business dealings with Turkey. She also slammed his habit of handing out classified information that he wasn t even supposed to have in the first place, which has happened at least twice. Two former government officials with direct knowledge of the issue tell CNN that while Flynn oversaw intelligence in Afghanistan, he shared classified information with Pakistan on terror networks responsible for killing American troops,  CNN recalled this week when Flynn s name was floated.  The intelligence, the sources say, came from another agency. Flynn wasn t supposed to share it. They say he was trying to convince Pakistan to stop sheltering terrorists. Maddow concluded: I know he s not going to get as much coverage as the other people who have to get confirmed over the next few days but stick a pin in that. It s really, really important.

       " 'UKIP leader Paul Nuttall has used a landmark speech to brand Islamist extremism a â\\x80\\x9ccancer within our societyâ\\x80\\x9d proposing a range of robust actions to ensure it is â\\x80\\x9ccut outâ\\x80\\x9d. [The Liverpudlian MEP described how, in the past, the police and MI5 had â\\x80\\x9cfoiled plot after plot in the nick of timeâ\\x80\\x9d but are now â\\x80\\x9cbeing overwhelmed by the impossible scaleâ\\x80\\x9d of the problem.  He criticised an establishment which has been complacent in allowing Islamists to â\\x80\\x9cset up home in Britainâ\\x80\\x9d since the 1980s, on the mistaken assumption that they would not attack the country which had given them shelter. Nuttall also singled out particular actions undertaken by Theresa May in her former role as Home Secretary for denunciation, such as the massive police cuts carried out at the behest of former Chancellor of the Exchequer Geroge Osborne, and the abolition of control orders in favour of weaker TPims at the behest of former Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg.

Nuttall also pledged to tackle the â\\x80\\x9crampant radicalisation within our prisonsâ\\x80\\x9d by reversing cuts to prison funding and officer numbers, and to train 4, 000 new border guards to â\\x80\\x9cproperly control our bordersâ\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   which experts now believe to be â\\x80\\x9cporousâ\\x80\\x9d particularly along the coast. Asked how he would fund these changes, along with a â\\x80\\x9cmajor increase in resources for MI5â\\x80\\x9d the UKIP leader pointed to Â£35 billion in savings identified in his partyâ\\x80\\x99s manifesto, mainly from reducing the ballooning foreign aid budget, cutting the controversial High Speed Rail 2 project, and changing the Barnett formula  â\\x80\\x94   described as a â\\x80\\x9cterrible mistakeâ\\x80\\x9d by its late creator  â\\x80\\x94   which sees Scotland receive higher levels of funding than elsewhere in Britain.

The UKIP leader also demanded the Government â\\x80\\x9cclose down mosques where extreme Wahhabi or Salafist versions of Islam are preachedâ\\x80\\x9d and to bar the funding of religious institutions in Britain by Saudi Arabia and Qatar the latter of which was recently isolated by key Arab nations for its alleged support for overseas extremism.

       " 'It looks like Donald Trump can add another case to the list of lawsuits he is facing. An attorney, based in Washington, D.C., has filed suit in federal court alleging that the financial disclosure Trump filed in May 2016 was not even close to accurate.Jeffrey Lovitky filed the lawsuit on March 14. According to Politico, Trump mixed his personal liabilities in with his business liabilities, making it impossible for voters to get a true picture of his potential conflicts of interest. The purpose of these disclosure requirements is to allow members of the public to make informed judgments as to whether candidates for federal office have financial conflicts of interests that may impair their ability to faithfully execute their duties as public servants,  Lovitky explained in the complaint.Lovitky s suit does not accuse Trump of any improprieties, but it does allege that the public has not been given truthful information regarding Trump s many debts due to the lack of clarity in the financial disclosure. If you just look at the statement on its face, all those liabilities are assumed to be personal liabilities, but I just do not think that s the case. I have information that says otherwise,  Lovitky said during an interview with Politico.When Lovitky was asked why he decided to pursue this issue in court, he said that when it comes to Trump, there are  very serious concerns about conflicts of interest. It s mostly the fact that with this president there are very serious concerns about conflicts of interest in this particular administration, and I think it s important that those concerns be addressed thoroughly,  the attorney explained.Lovitky is not seeking damages in the suit and is only asking the court to declare Trump s financial disclosure illegal and order him to file a new one that accurately represents his personal debts. Currently, his next financial closure is not scheduled to be released until May 2018. U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who was appointed by Bill Clinton, has been assigned the case.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images',\n",

Your campaign has been involved in a series of incidents that people are calling dirty tricks. In Iowa, the Cruz campaign sent out tweets saying Ben Carson was suspending his campaign. That was false. The campaign put out fliers accusing people of voting violations, that was false. In South Carolina, a Cruz super PAC attacked Trump over the Confederate flag. And your then-communications director posted a link this week accusing Rubio of disrespecting the Bible. That was false. Do you take personal responsibility   this was your campaign except for the super PAC   do you take personal responsibility for this series of incidents? And what does it say about the culture of the campaign you are running? Cruz not only failed to take personal responsibility for his campaign s actions, he called Wallace a liar and accused him of being a Donald Trump pawn. Every accusation you raised there is incorrect,  Cruz replied.  I appreciate your reading the Donald Trump attack file on that. And that did NOT sit well with Wallace at all, and he proceeded to take Cruz to the woodshed for it.WALLACE:  Oh, come on, sir. Wait a minute, sir. You personally apologized to Ben Carson on a debate stage. CRUZ:  Chris, don t interrupt me. WALLACE:  You fired your communications director. CRUZ:  Chris, don t interrupt me. WALLACE:  Don t say this in an oppo file on our part, sir. CRUZ:  Chris, please don t interrupt me. WALLACE:  Please don t accuse me of something I didn t do. CRUZ:  Let me know when I m allowed to answer. WALLACE:  Well, don t accuse me of doing something I didn t do. Two of those things, you apologized for one and you fired your communications director. Don t say this is the oppo file. After his ass-whooping by Wallace, Cruz went on to unbelievably claim that his campaign is running at the  highest level of integrity,  completely unfazed by the facts presented by Wallace to his face.Here s the video via YouTube.This is the perfect example of Ted Cruz saying and doing anything to be president. Rather than explain himself and accept personal responsibility, Cruz flat out lied to Wallace and pretended his campaign has never done anything wrong. And then he complained about the line of questioning and claimed they were part of a Donald Trump-approved attack line.Ted Cruz definitely could have handled this better, but now all he has is egg on his face.Featured image via video screen capture',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON  â\\x80\\x94   The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for just the second time since the financial crisis of 2008, saying the American economy is expanding at a healthy pace and setting itself up as a counterweight to   Donald J. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s push for considerably faster growth. The Fed cited the steady growth of employment and other economic measures, and signaled that it expects to raise rates more quickly next year to prevent the economy from growing too quickly. â\\x80\\x9cMy colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made,â\\x80\\x9d Janet L. Yellen, the Fedâ\\x80\\x99s chairwoman, said at a news conference after the announcement. â\\x80\\x9cWe expect the economy will continue to perform well. â\\x80\\x9d The widely expected decision moves the Fedâ\\x80\\x99s benchmark rate to a range of 0. 5 percent to 0. 75 percent, still very low by historical standards. Low rates support economic growth by encouraging borrowing and  . The American economy has expanded by about 2 percent a year over the last six years, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 4. 6 percent. The Fedâ\\x80\\x99s assessment that the economy is growing at a healthy pace  â\\x80\\x94   not too hot, not too cold  â\\x80\\x94   is starkly at odds with Mr. Trump, who has promised 4 percent growth and has described job creation as â\\x80\\x9cterribleâ\\x80\\x9d and economic growth as anemic. Already on Wednesday, one Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee, Representative Roger Williams of Texas, criticized the Fedâ\\x80\\x99s move. â\\x80\\x9cTodayâ\\x80\\x99s decision by the Fed to raise the interest rate is entirely premature and will be burdensome to a nation already struggling to pull itself out of this   Obama economy,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Williams said in a statement. â\\x80\\x9cBy making rates even higher, the Fed is effectively making our hardships even harder. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Williams did not object when the Fed raised rates last December. In announcing the decision after a   meeting of the Fedâ\\x80\\x99s   committee, the central bank gave little indication that Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s election had altered its economic outlook. The Fed said it still expected a slow economic expansion and a steady march toward higher rates. In separate forecasts also published Wednesday, Fed officials predicted three rate increases in 2017. For the first time in recent years, however, there is a real possibility of significant changes in fiscal policy. Republicans will control the White House and both chambers of Congress, and Mr. Trump has promised to increase economic growth and job creation through tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Those measures could spur faster growth after a presidential campaign in which Mr. Trump regularly disparaged the economyâ\\x80\\x99s performance under President Obama. But the Fed reiterated Wednesday that the economy is already expanding at roughly the maximum sustainable pace. Fed officials also see evidence that the labor market is tightening. Several Fed districts reported labor shortages in the central bankâ\\x80\\x99s most recent compilation of economic reports. In the Philadelphia district, construction workers are hard to find. Atlanta reported a shortage of nurses Kansas City, truck drivers Dallas, tech workers. Faster growth, in the Fedâ\\x80\\x99s judgment, would probably lead to higher inflation. As a result, if Republicans succeed in invigorating growth, the Fed is likely to raise rates more quickly. The greater the stimulus, the faster interest rates are likely to rise. â\\x80\\x9cYour expectation should depend very little on what you think that the F. O. M. C. is thinking and very much on your view of Trump policies and their macro effects,â\\x80\\x9d said Jon Faust, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to Ms. Yellen, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t focus on the Fed. As James Carville regularly reminded the other Clinton on the campaign trail: Itâ\\x80\\x99s the economy, stupid. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Yellen emphasized that the Fed was not prejudging the likely course of events. She declined several times to comment on the merits of Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s plans or to predict their consequences for the economy. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Yellen said. Fed officials predicted that they would raise the Fedâ\\x80\\x99s benchmark rate a little more quickly in the coming years, reaching 2. 1 percent by the end of 2018. In September, they had predicted that it would reach 1. 9 percent by the end of 2018. The new projections, however, reflect a significantly slower pace of increase than last December, when they expected the rate to reach 3. 3 percent by 2018. The combination of steady growth and faster rate increases indicates that some Fed officials expect the central bank to end up offsetting a modest increase in fiscal stimulus. But Ms. Yellen said most Fed officials were reserving judgment. â\\x80\\x9cChanges in fiscal policy or other economic policies could affect the economic outlook,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cOf course, it is far too early to know how those changes will unfold. â\\x80\\x9d The tensions between monetary and fiscal policy will develop slowly. Legislation takes time to write, and any economic impact would generally be felt in coming years. Political pressures, however, may build more quickly. Mr. Trump has made clear in the past that he likes low interest rates  â\\x80\\x94   and some of his plans, like infrastructure investment, will be much easier to fund if rates remain low. â\\x80\\x9cThe Fed is in a tricky place,â\\x80\\x9d said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re trying not to prejudge how Congress and the administration duke it out, but once they see that, I think they will respond. â\\x80\\x9d There is also uncertainty about the Fedâ\\x80\\x99s leadership. Ms. Yellenâ\\x80\\x99s term as chairwoman ends in February 2018, and Mr. Trump has said he would prefer a Republican. Ms. Yellen could remain on the board, a possibility she said Wednesday she had not ruled out. But the Fed, under different leadership, might well choose a different path forward. Some conservative economists, notably John Taylor of Stanford University, argue that the bank should already have raised rates above 1 percent. The economy, for now, keeps plodding along. Steady job growth has reduced the unemployment rate to a level the Fed considers healthy. A little unemployment is natural as people change jobs and businesses close. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have said they see some signs of stronger wage growth. Inflation, too, has picked up a little in recent months, although both wages and inflation continue to rise more slowly than the Fed would like to see. Ms. Yellen described the rate increase as â\\x80\\x9ca vote of confidence in the economy. â\\x80\\x9d The decision was made by a unanimous vote of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the first time in recent months the Fed has acted by consensus. Some economists argue that the Fed should wait until inflation strengthens before raising rates, to test whether a stronger economy would persuade some people sidelined during the downturn to start looking for jobs. That would expand the labor force. Unemployment remains particularly high among minorities. That view, however, has found little support among Fed officials, who worry that interest rates will have to be raised more quickly if they wait too long, increasing the chances of pushing the economy into recession. â\\x80\\x9cApparently, Fed officials think the economy is growing too quickly,â\\x80\\x9d said Ady Barkan, the director of Fed Up, a coalition of liberal groups that has pressed the Fed to continue its stimulus campaign. â\\x80\\x9cI doubt you can find many other Americans who share that opinion. And itâ\\x80\\x99s a strange conclusion to draw in the wake of an election that was so heavily impacted by votersâ\\x80\\x99 economic discontent. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

According to a source, nine Mosul youths were killed, all accused of belonging to an anti-ISIS resistance faction. \\nIraqi News reported August 31 that nine youths were convicted in an Islamic State sharia court of being members of a resistance faction in the city. They were summarily sentenced to a public execution.

       " 'PARIS (Reuters) - Four months after a heavy electoral defeat, France s National Front is on the verge of a split between its leader and her chief deputy that could open the way to a policy change on the euro as the far-right party seeks to rebrand itself.   Marine Le Pen s relationship with Florian Philippot, for years her closest aide, has become so strained since she lost the presidential election to centrist Emmanuel Macron that far-right experts say it has reached the point of no-return. A rupture would mark an important change for the FN and Le Pen because she has for years defended Philippot s anti-euro, protectionist line against critics in the party, and built her 2012 and 2017 presidential campaigns on his advice. Philippot has been under fire in the party over its setbacks in this year s presidential and parliamentary elections, with many blaming the anti-euro line he has backed so strongly.  Le Pen, whose leadership is also under scrutiny, has increasingly distanced herself from Philippot, focusing on the party s anti-immigration, identitarian roots in speeches rather than the party s stance on the euro. Philippot has stood firm, maintaining that opposing the euro is a vote winner.  Le Pen has now issued him an ultimatum, saying he must decide between his party role and a think-tank group known as the Patriots that he has set up focused on an anti-euro policy.   I don t intend to abandon the Patriots nor my convictions nor my ideals,  a visibly shaken Philippot said in an interview on CNews.  If they want to get rid of me and prevent me from working on the relaunch of the National Front, then let it be done,  he added. Minutes later Le Pen issued a terse statement saying she had decide to revoke his responsibilities for strategy and communications, but stopped short of firing him as vice president - for now. Jerome Fourquet, a specialist on the far-right at pollster Ifop, sees the split as definitive.   This seems to have escalated to a point of no-return,  he said. If Philippot leaves the party or is forced out, it could at first cause further turmoil for the far-right as it struggles to portray itself as the main opposition to Macron, despite having reached the second round of the presidential election in May. In the presidential run-off, Le Pen secured 34 percent of the vote against 66 percent for Macron   its strongest election performance but still a disappointment. In June s parliamentary election, the national Front won only eight seats.   The role of chief opponent has been assumed by Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed), who together with unions is leading calls for mass protests against reforms planned by Macron. The departure of Philippot, a graduate of France s top ENA administrative school, could be followed by others in the party with a similar profile walking out, depriving the party of figures who were key to policy-making. Le Pen and her party might, however, see long-term gains as his exit could enable her to reassert her authority and make it easier to shift policy on the euro. This might in turn help the FN forge alliances with other right-wing politicians.   If Philippot was to leave there would be a negative buzz, there would be turmoil in the FN, but after a while that would likely be digested and overcome,  Fourquet said. He underlined that the party had survived previous crises, such as the departure in the late 1990s of Bruno Megret, once a political star who took allies with him. Analysts say Philippot has fewer loyal allies and a smaller political capital than Megret did at the time and would therefore be unlikely to create a rival party that would pose a serious threat to the FN.              The deadline for the FN to decide how it wants to rebrand itself is March, when it will hold a party congress to decide on a new name and what its strategies and policies should be for the next presidential election due in 2022.         Jean Messiha, who coordinated Le Pen s presidential manifesto, said the party was in a difficult phase where it was adapting to France s changed political landscape.  We need to get our act together and, most importantly, we need Marine Le Pen to reaffirm, to reassert her authority,  he told Reuters. Le Pen s partner, senior FN official Louis Aliot, made a similar point, telling supporters at the weekend not to give in to  defeatism .  In politics, you re never dead,  he said. ',\n",
       " 'HOUSTON  â\\x80\\x94   The chants rang out loud and long at NRG Stadium in South Texas, not from bars or living rooms across New England, until a wall of sound enveloped a team and a quarterback on a mission. â\\x80\\x9cBrady, Brady,â\\x80\\x9d the fans screamed, and it is in moments like this  â\\x80\\x94   the first overtime in Super Bowl history  â\\x80\\x94   that Tom Brady appears most comfortable, as if lounging on his sofa in his beloved Uggs. In each of his previous four Super Bowl victories, Brady guided   drives for the Patriots. However sublime, those efforts against the Rams, the Panthers, the Eagles and the Seahawks all seemed quaint before Sunday night. That is when Brady again summoned the sorcery of his right arm to stun the Atlanta Falcons in what is undoubtedly the greatest late surge in a Super Bowl. When James White sneaked into the end zone from 2 yards away, completing a   victory that defied the bounds of credulity and secured the Patriotsâ\\x80\\x99 fifth title, his teammates stormed onto the field, flung their helmets and hugged anyone who moved. Across the field, the Falcons watched from their sideline as if fossilized in amber, too exhausted and dumbstruck to move. The Patriots trailed by 25 points with 2 minutes 12 seconds remaining in the third quarter  â\\x80\\x94   and by 19 with 9:48 left in regulation  â\\x80\\x94   and they won. They won because of Dontâ\\x80\\x99a Hightowerâ\\x80\\x99s critical   and Julian Edelmanâ\\x80\\x99s Velcro hands and the clock management and coaching of a maestro, Bill Belichick, but mostly because of a truism that has beleaguered the leagueâ\\x80\\x99s other 31 teams for 16 years running: the Patriots have Brady, and no one else does, not even the Falcons, who boasted the N. F. L. â\\x80\\x99s most valuable player in Matt Ryan. Super Bowl LI Box Score Not including their   possession at the end of regulation, the Patriots, after mustering only a field goal on their first seven drives, scored on their final five possessions. â\\x80\\x9cAt halftime, I would say we werenâ\\x80\\x99t down at all,â\\x80\\x9d Brady said. â\\x80\\x9cWe were disappointed in the way we played, and we knew that we could go out and do a lot better in the second half. â\\x80\\x9d Brady completed 43 of 62 passes for 466 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception, a performance that earned him Super Bowl M. V. P. honors for the fourth time in his career. In none of the other three instances did he handle a season as challenging as this, from the illness plaguing his mother, Galynn, to the   suspension served for his role in that protracted saga known as Deflategate, after the underinflated footballs meant to give him a throwing advantage. In accepting the Vince Lombardi Trophy from Commissioner Roger Goodell, who meted out the punishment, the owner Robert K. Kraft did not outright address the scandal. But he did allude it to it in perhaps the strongest possible terms. â\\x80\\x9cA lot has transpired in the last two years, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t think that needs any explanation,â\\x80\\x9d Kraft said. Because of that, he said, this title is â\\x80\\x9cunequivocally the sweetest. â\\x80\\x9d His reputation sullied, Brady embarked on a nationwide tour of vindication that reached its climax in the venue where he won his second Super Bowl, back in February 2004, long before the Patriots achieved modern dynasty status in an era designed to encourage parity. Brady was 26 then, and it is possible that he is now superior in all facets, six months shy of his 40th birthday, at an age when most of his peers have either retired or entered a noticeable decline. By going   during his suspension, the Patriots created the farcical perception that they no longer needed him  â\\x80\\x94   that quarterbacks in New Englandâ\\x80\\x99s ruthless machinery are interchangeable, even Brady. He turbocharged the Patriotsâ\\x80\\x99 offense with 33 touchdowns to four interceptions heading into Sunday, when he toiled, misfiring wide and long, until late in the third quarter. Powered by three touchdowns in a 9:54 span of the second quarter, Atlanta led by   with 10 minutes left before the Patriots unleashed 10 minutes of mayhem. Hightowerâ\\x80\\x99s   catalyzed the comeback, with Brady capitalizing on excellent field position to find Danny Amendola from 6 yards out. Less than 6 minutes remained, and though the Falcons advanced deep into New England territory, a holding penalty knocked them out of   range, forcing them to punt. This might be the appropriate point to note the travails of the Falcons franchise. Their woeful inaugural season of 1966, completed weeks before the first Super Bowl, presaged Atlantaâ\\x80\\x99s struggles for the next  . It took more than a decade for the Falcons to reach the playoffs, more than three to advance to a conference championship and more than four to stack consecutive winning seasons. The Falcons traded Brett Favre and had a coach, Bobby Petrino, notify players that he was quitting by leaving notes at their lockers. The only other time Atlanta reached the Super Bowl, in January 1999, one of its best defensive players, Eugene Robinson, was arrested for soliciting a prostitute the night before. They have lost far more than they won, endured more agony than ecstasy and been lampooned for everything from their attendance to their uniforms, and for all those reasons  â\\x80\\x94   and more  â\\x80\\x94   a city that had not claimed a champion since the Braves won the World Series in 1995 was ready to celebrate with abandon once more. But first, Brady. He still had to contend with a defense overseen by the Falconsâ\\x80\\x99 coach, Dan Quinn, who nearly foiled him two years ago, when he worked in Seattle. For all of Belichickâ\\x80\\x99s experience, Quinn had coached in more Super Bowls recently, three in the last four seasons. The memory of that loss to New England still smolders for Quinn, who from that game remembers not the     interception by Malcolm Butler, but how the Seahawks went ahead to stay with about two minutes left. Quinn may never again coach a defense as fast and physical  â\\x80\\x94   words emblazoned on a bracelet he has worn  â\\x80\\x94   as Seattleâ\\x80\\x99s, but for the first three quarters on Sunday, the Falcons harassed Brady, swarmed the ball and created turnovers, converting both of New Englandâ\\x80\\x99s mistakes before halftime into 14 points. Most obvious was the Falconsâ\\x80\\x99 speed advantage, and how, as Quinnâ\\x80\\x99s Seahawks did against Denver in the 2014 game, they parlayed it into momentum. Robert Alfordâ\\x80\\x99s   interception return for a touchdown, the   return in a Super Bowl, had the same effect on the Patriots as Malcolm Smithâ\\x80\\x99s for Seattle three years ago. And that, to an extent, was part of the plan Quinn toted along with him to Atlanta, whose ascension under him began with an evolved way of thinking forged by his time in Seattle: He wanted his players to work as hard as they ever have  â\\x80\\x94   but have a great time doing it. The Super Bowl was enjoyable, until it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a hard one in the locker room,â\\x80\\x9d Quinn said. â\\x80\\x9cNo place to put that one mentally for us. â\\x80\\x9d One of the Patriotsâ\\x80\\x99 underappreciated assets during their dominant stretch has been their resilience, which seems odd given how rarely they tend to lose, or even trail. They fell behind Sunday for the first time since Week 12 against the Jets. But the ethos cultivated by Belichick demands an uncommon fortitude. Those who cannot handle the atmosphere are weeded out like overwhelmed med students. Belichick built this reputation by twice smothering prolific offenses in Super Bowls  â\\x80\\x94   the 1990 Bills, when he coordinated the Giantsâ\\x80\\x99 unit, and the 2001 Rams, in the championship that launched New Englandâ\\x80\\x99s dynasty. As potent as that Rams team was, it actually averaged fewer points and fewer yards per play during the season, and committed 33 more turnovers, than these Falcons. Scoring 80 points across two playoff victories emboldened Atlanta running back Devonta Freeman to call the Falconsâ\\x80\\x99 offense â\\x80\\x9cunstoppable. â\\x80\\x9d Except that the Patriots did, in fact, stop Atlanta on all four   possessions, empowering Brady with two timeouts and 3:30 left, chasing an   deficit. They marched 91 yards on a drive extended by a reception by Edelman as absurd as the comeback itself, one that evoked so many catches of past New England Super Bowls. Only this time, instead of watching opponents do the impossible  â\\x80\\x94   David Tyree hugging the ball against his helmet or Mario Manningham tiptoeing along the sideline or Jermaine Kearse contorting himself  â\\x80\\x94   it was the Patriots who amazed. While falling, Edelman caught a tipped pass, then dropped it, then cradled the ball just before it would have touched the ground. â\\x80\\x9cIt was one of the greatest catches Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever seen,â\\x80\\x9d Brady said. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know how the hell he caught it. I mean, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think anybody  â\\x80\\x94   I donâ\\x80\\x99t think he does. â\\x80\\x9d It only mattered that he did, and after White scored with 57 seconds left and Danny Amendola converted the tying   conversion, the Patriots called heads, won the coin toss and never let Atlanta touch the ball again. Only with a cleareyed view of these last five months, after the completion of another N. F. L. season, can it now be said: The anxiety, anger and exasperation that pervaded New England for months, after the scandal that cost the Patriots their sainted quarterback for a spell and dented their reputation  â\\x80\\x94   none of it mattered. The Patriots reached the final game, just as they thought they would. And they won, just as they thought they would all along, even if they never could have conjured how they did it. Brady and the Patriots were down for much of Sunday night, but they reappeared in the fourth quarter. And now, after Sunday, after winning yet another Super Bowl, he struck a familiar pose: holding the Lombardi Trophy as confetti fell.',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - A Kansas state senator on Monday declined to back down from comments comparing Planned Parenthood to Nazi concentration camps, which he made after finding out that a donation had been sent to the organization in his name. â\\x80\\x9cKilling people equals killing people,â\\x80\\x9d Republican state Senator Steve Fitzgerald said in a phone interview when asked about the comparison on Monday, referring to abortion.  â\\x80\\x9cPlanned Parenthood is killing more people than they did in Nazi Germany,â\\x80\\x9d he said.  The Nazis were responsible for the systematic killing of 6 million Jews, as well as others such as homosexuals, Roma people and political opponents during World War Two. Planned Parenthood provides abortions as well as other womenâ\\x80\\x99s health services, including birth control and cancer screenings. It has long been a target of conservative Republicans. Fitzgerald has been in the spotlight since Planned Parenthood on Friday made public a letter from the senator in which he wrote that finding out that a donation had been made to the group in his name was â\\x80\\x9cas bad - or worse - as having oneâ\\x80\\x99s name associated with Dachau.â\\x80\\x9d Dachau was a Nazi concentration camp estimated to have been the site of nearly 32,000 killings.  In his letter, Fitzgerald castigated the organization and the donor, Kansas City, Missouri, resident Ali Weinel, calling the move an attempt to â\\x80\\x9cblackenâ\\x80\\x9d his name by associating him with a â\\x80\\x9cheinousâ\\x80\\x9d group. Weinel said Monday that she made the donation in the senatorâ\\x80\\x99s name about a month ago after a contentious email exchange with Fitzgerald, in which he expressed disgust over her views on abortion. â\\x80\\x9cI was so frustrated by the email exchange that the only thing I could think to do was to donate to Planned Parenthood in his honor,â\\x80\\x9d Weinel said. Making donations to the organization in the name of conservative elected officials has become a tactic among some on the left as a way to make a political statement. Planned Parenthood Great Plains spokeswoman Bonyen Lee-Gilmore called Fitzgeraldâ\\x80\\x99s concentration camp comparison inflammatory. â\\x80\\x9cWe obviously condemn this extreme ideology,â\\x80\\x9d Lee-Gilmore said in a telephone interview on Monday. Lee-Gilmore said that after receiving Weinelâ\\x80\\x99s donation, the organization had last month sent Fitzgerald a form letter, which his Friday letter was apparently a response to. Fitzgerald called the events political theater on the part of Planned Parenthood.  â\\x80\\x9cThe letter they sent me was strictly a poke in the eye,â\\x80\\x9d Fitzgerald said. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I responded to it.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",
       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump lauded his Beijing meetings on trade and North Korea as  very productive , ending a visit which Chinese media declared set a  new blueprint  for handling ties, even as the White House looks set for tougher action on China. Trump pressed China to do more to rein in North Korea s nuclear ambitions and said bilateral trade had been unfair to the United States, but also praised Xi s pledge that China would be more open to foreign firms.  Hours after Trump left Beijing on Friday, China said it would drop foreign ownership limits on local banks and asset management companies while loosening stake restrictions in securities firms and insurers - moves that have been long awaited by foreign financial firms. Beijing faces intensifying pressure from Western governments and business lobbies to remove investment barriers and other rules that hobble overseas firms from operating in the country, as well as intellectual property theft. Washington has refrained from pushing harder on trade because it needs China s cooperation on North Korea, although Xi, at least in public, went no further than reiterating China s determination to achieve denuclearization through talks. Trump and Xi, who call themselves friends, also oversaw the signing of about $250 billion in commercial deals, a show that some in the U.S. business community and others say detracts from addressing structural impediments that puts them at a disadvantage to Chinese rivals. China may be mistaken in thinking it had done enough to address U.S. concerns, and Trump could find people disappointed at home he didn t make more progress on items like market access and North Korea, Paul Haenle, Director of the Carnegie Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, said.  My concern is you may see a shift towards a much harder line coming from the U.S. administration. That will be a huge surprise to China and President Xi, especially given that Xi likely feels he has done a lot for Trump on this visit.  Trump reiterated in a tweet just before leaving Beijing for the APEC summit of Asia Pacific leaders in Vietnam that he didn t blame China for the trade gap between the two countries, adding that he had  very productive  meetings on trade and North Korea with Xi.  I don t blame China, I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100 s of billions. How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue? I would ve done same!  A U.S. industry source said the implication of Trump blaming his predecessors for the trade deficit is that Trump won t make the same mistake - a warning to Xi, not a capitulation.  The Trump administration did not bring hard trade policy items to the discussion with Xi because U.S. officials don t want to  argue over crumbs , the source added.  Barring some dramatic action on North Korea by Xi, there is going to be a hard turn in U.S. trade policy,  the source said. A second source, who is close to the business delegation that traveled to Beijing this week, added that the Trump administration appeared poised to take a much harder line in the weeks ahead. There were no obvious gaffes during the two-night stopover, and Trump and Xi seemed to enjoy being in each other s company. At a banquet on Thursday night in the Great Hall of the People, Trump and Xi dined on coconut chicken soup, spicy chicken, stewed beef with tomatoes and grouper fillets. Chinese state media said the tone and outcome of Trump s visit had been largely positive, saying Trump and Xi were setting a new blueprint for handling relations and managing their differences.    China has tried its utmost, even at the sacrifice of Sino-North Korean relations,  influential tabloid the Global Times wrote in its editorial.   Trump has gradually learned that Beijing is indeed making selfless contributions to promoting the denuclearization of the peninsula. He can t demand more.  ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Saturday it had ordered that Iran, Venezuela and four African nations be added to a U.S. list of countries accused of failing to crack down on human trafficking, a step that further isolates them from the United States.  The White House said it also was increasing restrictions on North Korea, Eritrea, Russia and Syria, which already were on the list, by constraining them from engaging in educational or cultural exchange programs with the United States. In addition, President Donald Trump s administration instructed the U.S. executive director of the International Monetary Fund and U.S. executive directors at other multilateral development banks to vote against extending loans or other funds to North Korea, Russia and Iran for fiscal year 2018, which begins on Sunday. Under a 2000 U.S. law called the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the United States does not provide non-humanitarian, non-trade-related foreign assistance to any country that fails to comply with minimum standards for eliminating trafficking and is not making efforts to do so. The White House said in a notice that Iran, Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Equatorial Guinea, South Sudan and Sudan had been added to the list of countries subject to these restrictions for the new fiscal year. The move came six days after Trump included Venezuela and Iran on a list of eight countries targeted for travel restrictions to the United States. The restrictions on Venezuela focused on government officials who the Trump administration blamed for the country s slide into economic disarray. The travel ban on Iranians was broader. That travel ban list lifted previous restrictions on citizens from Sudan. ',\n",
       " 'ANKARA (Reuters) - The European Union does not share Turkey s view that the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen is a terrorist organization and would need to see  substantive  evidence to change its stance, the EU s counter-terrorism coordinator said. The comments by Gilles de Kerchove are likely to infuriate Ankara, which accuses Gulen of masterminding a failed military coup last year, in which more than 250 people were killed. Gulen has denied the charge and condemned the coup. Turkey has long accused its NATO allies, including the United States and Germany, of failing to condemn the abortive putsch strongly enough, saying they appeared more concerned by Ankara s ensuing crackdown on suspected supporters of the coup.  As for FETO, we don t see it as a terrorist organization, and I don t believe the EU is likely to change its position soon,  Kerchove said, using the Turkish government s acronym for Gulen s network.  You need not only circumstantial evidence - like just downloading an app - but concrete substantive data which shows that they were involved...,  he told Reuters in an interview cleared for publication on Thursday. Turkish authorities have detained some 50,000 people, including teachers, police officers, journalists and U.S. consular staff for alleged links to Gulen s network. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from their jobs. Some have been detained for having downloaded ByLock, a messaging app the government says was used by the coup plotters. Others have been detained for having had telephone calls with ByLock users. Human rights groups and some EU officials accuse Erdogan of using the crackdown to muzzle dissent in Turkey, a charge Ankara denies. It says the scale of the clampdown is justified because the Gulen network threatens national security. Gulen was once an ally of Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party and his movement ran schools, banks and media outlets in Turkey until the two men had a public falling-out in 2013. Germany s BND spy agency has said it is not convinced that Gulen was behind the failed coup, in which rogue soldiers used tanks and helicopters to attack Turkey s parliament and other key targets. Turkey has also sought, so far unsuccessfully, Gulen s extradition from the United States, where the cleric has lived in self-imposed exile since 1999. U.S. officials say their courts require sufficient evidence to order his extradition. As of July, Turkey had supplied 84 boxes of documents to the United States for evidence, Ankara s envoy to Washington has said, although he has acknowledged that more concrete evidence of Gulen s direct involvement has remained elusive. Germany, which has sharply criticized the mass arrests in Turkey, has refused to extradite people Ankara says were involved in the plot or linked to Gulen s network.  The decision on extradition is in the hands of all member states, and most of the time the judiciary, the independent judiciary, and they need hard evidence,  Kerchove said. ',\n",

Hodgkinson:  We don t know what sadness was in this guy s life ,,,,Blah, Blah, Blah INEQUALITY!Matthews had the unbelievable gaul to bring up sympathy for this guy making an excuse for his heinous act by using class warfare  inequality  is exactly the twisted thinking that caused this loser to shoot people:Hodgkinson was a hater of Republicans and President Trump. He volunteered for Sen. Bernie Sanders during the 2016 election. His deranged view of conservatives lead to the shooting.Check out the word salad ramble of Matthews trying to somehow justify what would make someone shoot Republicans: Howard, you and I know each other. You know what goes into somebody s we can say wacky behavior because they re dead. We don t know what sadness was in this guy s life   what his prospects were. Something that made him mad at the world so he focused on Republicans. He did understand inequality as an issue. Bernie Sanders wrote about that in the paper the other day. There s nothing wrong with the issue. It s a great issue to fight for if you re a progressive. But he got it into his head that he was going to get better equality of incomes in this country by killing people. That s not going to happen. ',\n",
       " 'Dominican newspaper El Nacional had a bit of fun with our comically inept President* when they  accidentally  used a photo of Trump s arch-nemesis Alec Baldwin instead of our orange-skinned wannabe dictator in a recent story.The story was regarding Trump s upcoming meeting with war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu following the United States  decision to block a Palestinian official from a U.N. appointment for fear it would hurt Bibi s precious little feelings. The United States was disappointed to see a letter indicating the intention to appoint the former Palestinian Authority prime minister to lead the UN Mission in Libya,  unqualified mess of a human being and U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley said. For too long the U.N. has been unfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel. This, of course, is sure to make Netanyahu happy prior to the meeting, where he and Trump are expected to discuss moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The paper posted what appears to be a  tongue-in-cheek  photo correction, claiming that they were sent the photo by the Associated Press.It is unclear if this was an honest mistake or an  alt-mistake,  but one thing is for certain   Trump is not going to be happy when he sees this.Featured image via screengrab',\n",
       " 'The  law and order candidate  broke the law again.Donald Trump recently declared that he would reverse President Obama s deal with Cuba to reopen diplomatic relations between our two nations after 50 years. All of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done with executive order, which means the next president can reverse them,  Trump said earlier this month.  And that is what I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands. Those demands include freeing political prisoners and expanding religious liberty.That s funny, because the Republican nominee certainly didn t give a shit about either of those things when he violated the United States embargo against Cuba back in 1998.A Newsweek investigation revealed:A company controlled by Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, secretly conducted business in Communist Cuba during Fidel Castro s presidency despite strict American trade bans that made such undertakings illegal, according to interviews with former Trump executives, internal company records and court filings.Trump s company spent a total of $68,000 for the trip to meet with government officials, bankers, and businessmen in order to gain a foothold on the island just in case the American government ended the embargo. But Trump broke the law and he tried to cover up his crime by funneling the money to a consulting firm and making it look like a charitable effort.In 1999, Trump traveled to Miami for the first day of his presidential run as the Reform Party candidate and hypocritically told the Cuban-American crowd that he would keep the embargo in place because any money spent there  goes to Fidel Castro. He s a murderer. He s a killer. He s a bad guy in every respect, and, frankly, the embargo must stand if for no other reason than, if it does stand, he will come down. And so, Donald Trump admitted that he gave $68,000 to  a murderer  and  a killer  who is  a bad guy in every respect. Now to make things clear, President Obama only reopened diplomatic relations with Cuba, which is within his executive power. The embargo is still in effect. But Republicans have whined about Obama s Cuba policy ever since.So what will they say about Trump s blatant violation of the embargo itself and the fact that he spent $68,000 on the trip, money that dictator Fidel Castro must have appreciated?If Republicans don t condemn Trump for this they will be committing hypocrisy at the highest level. It will make it clear for every American that they don t care about law and order as much as they care about power. Donald Trump broke the law and tried to make a deal with Fidel Castro s Cuba and he was merely a businessman. Just imagine what laws he could violate and get away with as president.Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images',\n",

Zachary Cole Fernandez, a    artist, surrendered on Monday with his lawyer at his side, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. He was booked on a misdemeanor trespassing charge and released on bail. The sign was changed about 3 a. m. on Jan. 1, when two Oâ\\x80\\x99s were partly obscured by sheets and turned into Eâ\\x80\\x99s. It remained that way throughout the morning before the sign was restored. In a phone interview, Mr. Fernandez said he considered the results more of an art installation than a prank. â\\x80\\x9cYeah, I broke the rules, but I broke it with good spirit and good intentions,â\\x80\\x9d he said on Tuesday. â\\x80\\x9cIt was just to bring light and positivity and happiness. â\\x80\\x9d But David Ryu, a Los Angeles councilman, remained unamused. â\\x80\\x9cPranks of this nature deplete the resources of our valuable public safety personnel, in both responding to the prank and in responding to the increased crowds and copycat attempts that these incidents generate,â\\x80\\x9d he said in a statement on Monday. â\\x80\\x9cMy office has urged the city attorney and L. A. P. D. to investigate and prosecute this case, as well as all attempts to trespass near, alter, or vandalize the sign. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Fernandez is expected to appear in court on Feb. 15. He said he had been inspired by a similar alteration in 1976, and that he had used clamps and sheets so as not to damage the sign. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want to destroy anything,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m about peace and love and respect and integrity and a lot of things that in some ways are missing these days.

       " 'MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A suicide bomber disguised as a policeman blew himself up inside a police training camp in Somalia s capital Mogadishu on Thursday and killed at least 18 officers, officials said. Police spokesman Major Mohamed Hussein said the attacker strapped explosives to his body and infiltrated the General Kahiye Police Training Academy during an early morning parade.  Police were preparing for the 74th anniversary of police day. As they wanted to start  exercise, a suicide bomber came in and blew up himself. We lost 18 police officers and 15 others   were injured,  Muktar Hussein Afrah, Somalia s deputy police commander, told reporters at the blast scene.  Police will always continue their work despite death.  Police earlier put the death toll at 15. Reuters witnesses who attempted to visit the site of the blast said police had sealed it off. Hours later when they were allowed in, a witness saw body parts suspected to be from the bomber on the ground in the field where police officers had been training. The witness said the ground nearby had also been washed to remove blood stains and people were burying bodies at the police academy. The militant Islamist group al Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack and gave a higher death toll.  We killed 27 police (officers) and injured more,  Abdiasis Abu Musab, the group s military operations spokesman, told Reuters. Al Shabaab carries out frequent bombings in Mogadishu and other towns. The group, which is allied to al Qaeda, is waging an insurgency against the U.N.-backed government and its African Union allies in a bid to topple the weak administration and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam. The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 and have since been steadily losing territory to the combined forces of African Union peacekeepers and Somali security forces. On Tuesday, the U.S. Africom said the U.S. military had conducted an air strike on a vehicle they said was strapped with explosives some 65 km southwest of Mogadishu. Thursday s attack comes at a time when the African Union is finalizing plans to trim its peacekeeping mission called AMISOM. The 22,000-strong AU force is scheduled to leave by 2020 and some security experts say al Shabaab could find it easier to stage attacks as the peacekeeping forces are reduced because government forces will find it hard to replicate their work. At the same time, Somalia could become a safe haven for militants linked to al Qaeda currently in Yemen, the experts said. The peacekeepers were deployed to help secure a government that has struggled to establish central control in a country that plunged into civil war in the early 1990s. ',\n",
       " 'BARCELONA (Reuters) - Brazilian Felipe Massa completed two and a half race distances and put his Williams team on top of the timesheets as Formula Oneâ\\x80\\x99s final pre-season test got underway in Barcelona on Tuesday. Massa, brought back in January after his former team mate Valtteri Bottas moved to Mercedes as replacement for retired world champion Nico Rosberg, completed 168 laps of the Circuit de Catalunya. His eye-catching tally was matched only by Ferrariâ\\x80\\x99s Sebastian Vettel, who ended up third fastest (1:19.906) behind Red Bullâ\\x80\\x99s Daniel Ricciardo (1:19.900). â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t remember before doing a day with 168 laps in my career,â\\x80\\x9d said the 35-year-old Massa, whose fastest was one minute 19.726 seconds. â\\x80\\x9cIt was a lot of laps and I can feel it a bit on my body, but I am good. I feel in good shape for the new season,â\\x80\\x9d he added. Triple world champion Lewis Hamilton, the bookmakersâ\\x80\\x99 favorite for a fourth title this year, was fourth fastest with a total of 49 laps. Bottas, who took over the car in the afternoon, did 86 and was fifth. â\\x80\\x9cI think Ferrari are possibly the favorites,â\\x80\\x9d said Hamilton, whose running was cut short after the champions discovered damage to the floor of the car. â\\x80\\x9cWe canâ\\x80\\x99t take our eyes off them because they have been doing such a great job at the moment. â\\x80\\x9cRed Bull look like they have gone quite quick today as well.

       " 'The majority of Republicans have fought tooth and nail to make sure that the LGBT community could not have the same rights and protections as others. President Barack Obama s presidency has been a major threat to those intolerant values, as marriage equality was finally legalized in all 50 states during his second term. Obama is still this nation s voice of equality, and today marks yet another tremendous win for the LGBT community.On Friday, Obama announced that the Stonewall Inn will become the first LGBT-dedicated National Monument. The Stonewall Inn is a historic landmark, and was the site of the 1969 riots that kicked off the gay rights movement. In releasing the news that the Stonewall Inn will be named a National Historic Monument, the White House released a powerful video, which announces that the Stonewall Inn will be the first official National Park Service unit dedicated to telling the story of LGBT Americans, just days before the one year anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision guaranteeing marriage equality in all 50 states. In the video, Obama delivers a message that is going to have Republicans fuming once again: I believe our national parks should reflect the full story of our country, the richness and diversity and uniquely American spirit that has always defined us: that we are stronger together, that out of many, we are one. The Stonewall National Monument covers almost 8 acres in New York s Greenwich Village, including the Stonewall Inn   the site where LGBT patrons fought police persecution. Obama spoke on the police raids in the video, and noted how the gay bar deserved a place in American history: Raids like these were nothing new, but this time the patrons had had enough. So they stood up and spoke out. The riots became protests. The protests became a movement. The movement ultimately became an integral part of America. Also in the video are the words of LGBT activist Eunic Ortiz, who said: The Stonewall riots in 1969, I think, obviously was a very pivotal point in our history. It was when we all stood up, and a trans woman of color said,  Enough is enough,  and it started a movement. And it started a movement that said,  We re not less than you. We are your equals. You can watch the powerful video below:In a press release, the White House said: Although the LGBT civil rights movement has made significant progress in the pursuit of equal rights and protections under the law, there is still more work to do. As seen two weeks ago in Orlando, FL, LGBT Americans continue to face acts of violence, discrimination, and hate. LGBT people of color are especially at risk. The Administration is committed to continuing the fight for dignity, acceptance and equal rights for all Americans   no matter who they are or who they love. Even decades after the riots, the bar has continued to be an attraction for gay rights activists   last year, after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, LGBT activists gathered there in celebration. Recently, following the tragic mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida earlier this month, mourners gathered at the site.Judging from conservatives  reactions to the news, the GOP isn t taking this very well:YahooYahooYahooYahooMediaiteMediaiteBy now we know that if conservatives are getting this angry over something, that must mean that some real progress in America is being made. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), who helped lead the effort, said: Stonewall is finally taking its rightful place in American history. We are faced with painful reminders daily of how much further we must go to achieve true equality and tolerance for the LGBT community, but honoring and preserving the stories of all of the diverse participants in Stonewall in our National Park System is a clear symbol of how far we have come.

       " 'MANCHESTER, New Hampshire (Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are fighting to be best in class on an issue that resonates loudly with young Americans - runaway student debt. Days ahead of the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary election that kick off the party nomination process, the  White House contenders are shopping rival plans that would make college more affordable. Sanders is pitching a scheme to make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and Clinton is promoting one that would ensure students pay what they can without taking on crippling loans.  â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s important (to address student debt), so I can actually do something with my life,â\\x80\\x9d said Selena Alcantara, a 17-year-old freshman at Southern New Hampshire University, who estimates she will graduate $70,000 in the red. U.S. student debt has surged about 24 percent to around $1.2 trillion since 2012, according to the latest figures from the New York Federal Reserve, leaving many graduates with mortgage-sized tabs before they enter the workforce.  The problem is acute in New Hampshire - which stages its primary on Feb. 9. There, college debt runs about $33,410 per student, 15 percent above the U.S. average, according to The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit advocacy group. Only Delaware has a higher figure, at $33,808.  While Sanders is leading Clinton in New Hampshire polls, they are in a dead heat in Iowa. Nationwide, Clinton has an edge with support from 55 percent of her party compared to 36 percent for Sanders, in the fight to win the party nomination for the November election. But voters aged 18-49, most likely to be affected by student debt, are nearly evenly split between the two, according to recent polls. Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Democratic candidates have targeted the issue of student debt more aggressively than their Republican counterparts. Donald Trump and rival Ted Cruz, for example have not issued formal proposals on the subject.Â\\xa0 TUITION-FREE VS DEBT-FREEÂ\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0  Sanders, who polls show is the favorite to win New Hampshire, has a plan that would make all state colleges and universities tuition-free, a $75 billion per year project that his campaign says would be funded by a tax on Wall Street speculation. â\\x80\\x9cThis country made a commitment a very long time ago to provide tuition free education from kindergarten to the 12th grade,â\\x80\\x9d said Warren Gunnels, a policy adviser to Sanders. â\\x80\\x9cAnd right now a college education is just as important as a high school degree was 50 years ago.â\\x80\\x9d Critics have questioned whether the estimates for both the costs and financing are realistic. When Sanders outlined the plan at Southern New Hampshire University this month, the crowd of several hundred clapped and cheered loudly, even though SNHU is private and not under the purview of Sandersâ\\x80\\x99 proposal. In contrast, Clinton has pushed a more cautious plan targeting â\\x80\\x9cdebt-freeâ\\x80\\x9d college education, with proposals to increase access to tuition grants, push for income-based repayments, and - like Sanders - to allow graduates to refinance student loans at lower interest rates. Addressing a crowd of around 1,000 people in Manchester, New Hampshire last week, Clinton asked how many people carried student debt. â\\x80\\x9cOh my goodness. Yeah, me too, me too,â\\x80\\x9d she said as hands shot up around the room. Her plan would require students to work about 10 hours a week and would require higher-income families to contribute. Her campaign estimates it would cost $350 billion over 10 years - less than half of Sandersâ\\x80\\x99 price tag. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m a big proponent personally that the kids should have to have some skin in the game,â\\x80\\x9d said Scott McGilvray, the president of the New Hampshire branch of the National Education Association, which has endorsed Clinton. Jennifer and David Speidel, an adult couple from New Hampshire, worry their childrenâ\\x80\\x99s student loans will hit shortly after they pay off their own. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no break,â\\x80\\x9d Jennifer said. They are not the only adults who, for one reason or another, are dealing with student debts. About a fifth of households headed by people 45 to 54 years old have them, according to a 2014 study from the Government Accountability Office.  For students already enrolled in college, though, the debts are mounting even as the candidates campaign. â\\x80\\x9cI try not to think about that too much,â\\x80\\x9d said May Mullen, 19, another freshman at SNHU.

In the biblical encounter, David prevailed by keeping his foe Goliath at a distance with a formidable weapon, his sling.\\nToday a modern-day version of David and Goliath is playing out.\\nAlthough granted political asylum by Ecuador, a target of US empire finds himself ensconced under a form of arbitrary detention in Ecuador\\'s London embassy under constant surveillance by British police. The fully weaponized US empire, which boasts of its full-spectrum dominance, has arrayed itself and its allies against one unarmed (as in having no conventional weaponry) man who heads a publishing organization.\\nThis uppity publisher has had the temerity to expose the secret machinations and war crimes of the military-economic (albeit faltering on both fronts) behemoth to the world\\'s public. The pro-transparency publisher Wikileaks, its founder (and de facto political prisoner) Julian Assange, and anti-secrecy collaborators infuriated the United States establishment with a slew of documents, emails, and graphic exposes like the \" Collateral Murder \" video that demonstrated a US military engaged in war crimes.\\nNations states are adamant and fastidious about keeping their internal workings under wraps. But it is a one-way street, as many nation states seek to gather and store any and all information about the citizenry without seeking court approval or the approval of the citizenry in question.\\nMORE... Swedish government implicated in charges against Assange UN body to rule on \"arbitrary detention\" of Wikileaks founder Web-savvy Wikileaks objects to this double standard, and it welcomes, vets, and publishes troves of secret information premised on the principle of the public\\'s right to be informed about what their government is up to.\\nEvidence makes it clear that the violent American establishment engages in browbeating, inciting so-called color revolutions to destabilize and overthrow disobedient governments, military encirclement, and saber rattling. This self-described indispensable nation which preens its might before major nation states such as China and Russia was not about to have its full-spectrum dominance challenged by punk computer hackers.\\nLeaning on its allies, the US enacted a financing squeeze on Wikileaks. Many nation states have been severely crippled and devastated by US sanctions, but tiny Wikileaks proved more resilient and cleverer than the Washington schemers.\\nIn an attempt to topple Wikileaks, the US establishment has sought to lop off the head of Wikileaks. It has kept close tabs on Julian Assange and is purportedly behind a scheme to bring Assange down in Sweden: \"We have been warned that the Pentagon, for example, is thinking of deploying dirty tricks to ruin us.\"\\nIn Sweden consensual sex has been parlayed as rape. In self-defense Assange spoke to the facts of the situation :\\nHere we have a case, the Swedish case, where I have never been charged with a crime, where I have already been cleared [by the Stockholm prosecutor] and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric?\\n... the UN formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, I am subject to persecution by the United States.\\nDisinformation and distraction are among the underhanded tactics of empire.\\nWhile in Britain, Assange was eventually placed under house arrest. Sweden played out the drama while refusing to press charges or interview Assange in Britain on the allegations. It insisted he come to Sweden, which Assange was unwilling to do without an assurance that he would not be deported elsewhere, knowing full well that the US Department of Justice was preparing a case against him. Sweden refused to give such an assurance, which speaks strongly about Sweden\\'s intent to seek justice for any alleged crimes committed against its citizens.\\nDespite all this intrigue, Wikileaks has continued to publish and Assange has continued to give interviews. Assange did not cower, instead he chose to fight back against Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. This is because Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are the principals in power and the grand jury investigation into himself and Wikileaks has been occurring during their time in government.\\nClinton and the Democrats are victims of their own zeal and hubris. Along the way many outs presented themselves to the Democrats. They could have dropped the grand jury investigation. They could have provided an assurance that there would be no request for Assange\\'s deportation from Sweden. The US could even have given a presidential pardon to Assange. Extremely telling about the caliber of man that Assange is, is that he offered himself as a prisoner in exchange for the release of another political prisoner, Chelsea Manning.\\nBut empire and its minions were dismissive as is the way of empire. Empire does not negotiate deals. It takes what it wants because it believes it can.\\nThe result\\nThe corruption in the Democratic party has come to light. Wikileaks revealed that the Democratic National Committee conspired against party aspirant Bernie Sanders and heads fell. Clinton tellingly hired the subsequently fallen DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\\nClinton\\'s emails were leaked as were those of her campaign chair John Podesta. Revelations include \"pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations,\" a \" direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East,\" \"Libya, more than anyone else\\'s war, was Hillary Clinton\\'s war,\" and banks buying cabinet positions.\\nThe Clinton campaign has, predictably, been thrown into disarray.\\nThe Clintonites could not refute what was in their own emails. Instead they sought to deflect attention elsewhere. The Clintonites blamed Russian hacking for interfering in the US presidential race. Finally, Julian Assange felt compelled to state :\\nThe Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source.\\nNeither is Wikileaks complicit with Russia:\\nWe have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our [Russia]documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up.\\nGraciously toward Clinton, Assange said he feels sorry for the woman who wanted to \" drone \" him. Imagine what the response would have been if Assange had discussed the possibility of a drone attack against Clinton.\\nPresently, Assange downplays the damage from the barrage of leaks to the Clinton campaign for the presidency.\\nTrump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he\\'s had every establishment off side; Trump doesn\\'t have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence [agencies], arms companies... big foreign money ... are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves.\\nHowever, a counter coup was announced against the coup by \"Clinton cronyism.\" It is said to include FBI, CIA, military intelligence, other security organizations \"through Julian Assange\" that have promised to stop Clinton from becoming president and to convict and indict her and her cronies.\\nA revolution?\\nNo matter what transpires on November 8, the reverberations from this confrontation should be monumental. US democracy has â\\x80\\x94 again â\\x80\\x94 been revealed to be glaringly corrupt. Most importantly, the world\\'s preeminent military-industrial complex has been shown to be susceptible to the power of one person. Properly framed, it is the power of one person to work with other persons to form a greater consciousness, a consciousness that ultimately will transcend and defeat the corruption of empire.',\n",

Believe me, this was a giant step, in my opinion  â\\x80\\x94   positive, not negative. â\\x80\\x9d Kassam asked about the AHCAâ\\x80\\x99s potential to defund Planned Parenthood and whether such a provision has a chance of surviving in the Senate. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll have to see what the Senate does,â\\x80\\x9d replied Roe. â\\x80\\x9cMy hatâ\\x80\\x99s off to them. This is hard work. Look, we spent hours and hours and hours getting to where we were, getting to 216 votes with hiccups and starts. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI am a   obstetrician,â\\x80\\x9d he declared. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve delivered almost 5, 000 babies in my career before I retired and ran for Congress. Money from the federal government ought to go into health care. What we decided, we have 141 federally qualified health centers that provide health care in the state of Tennessee and three Planned Parenthood clinics. So we want to put that money where health care is going on, not abortions. â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cThis was a   step. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll see what the Senate does. I think most of us are very happy about that, Raheem,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Roe noted that Planned Parenthood provides services other than abortion. â\\x80\\x9cThey do sexually transmitted disease screening. They do breast exams, pap smears,â\\x80\\x9d he said. However, he added, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think any of their clinics actually do mammograms. I think they refer those out. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI know this was a big part for some people but a relatively small part of that whole package,â\\x80\\x9d he said of the Planned Parenthood funding issue. â\\x80\\x9cIn the state of Tennessee  â\\x80\\x94   I got this off of the Planned Parenthood website itâ\\x80\\x99s not a number Iâ\\x80\\x99m making up  â\\x80\\x94    they did 918 breast exams in 2016 in the three clinics in the state of Tennessee. I saw myself, just one doctor, between three and four thousand patients a year, every year. â\\x80\\x9d Roe disagreed with the criticism that the AHCA merely does some â\\x80\\x9ctweakingâ\\x80\\x9d of Obamacare, as Kassam put it, rather than substantially repealing the ACA. â\\x80\\x9cRemember, this is only the first part of this, Raheem,â\\x80\\x9d Roe reiterated. â\\x80\\x9cThis is all we could get in reconciliation, meaning it just takes 51 votes in the Senate. Again, I go back to the Senate rules. We were hamstrung because of what we could do. We passed already across state lines and association health plans. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s already been passed over to the Senate. Now, the Senate will filibuster that. â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not saying there are not ways you can get around it and do it. Remember, we have a Secretary of HHS, Tom Price, who can also do a lot of things just executively with the stroke of a pen,â\\x80\\x9d he added.  â\\x80\\x9cWhat weâ\\x80\\x99re trying to do  â\\x80\\x94   and I did a terrible job of this when we first debated the healthcare bill  â\\x80\\x94   this part of the market weâ\\x80\\x99re talking about, this individual and   market, is seven percent of the entire insurance market,â\\x80\\x9d said Roe, adding that â\\x80\\x9c160 million of us get our insurance through our employer. There are already ERISA protections in there for   conditions. There is no   exclusion if you have Medicaid, which 74 million people do. â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cAnd by the way, this is the first major reform of Medicaid in decades, maybe since it was established,â\\x80\\x9d he continued. â\\x80\\x9cAbout 57 million people get insurance through Medicare, where there is no   condition exclusion. What we tried to do was create a market in that seven percent to reconstruct the small market. Itâ\\x80\\x99s been destroyed by Obamacare. I mean, we have well over a third of the counties in this country, of the 3, 000 or so counties in America, that only have one choice, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s going up every day. That market has been destroyed. This will help recreate it. â\\x80\\x9d Roe said there were other free   features of the Obamacare replacement bill worth praising, such as the expansion of health savings accounts.  â\\x80\\x9cThis is just the beginning,â\\x80\\x9d he promised. â\\x80\\x9cLook, if I could have taken the bill I had written and passed it with 216 votes, as written, it would look different. We want to recreate a situation where doctors and patients are making choices, not bureaucrats. â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cIf we fail at this, if we fail with making it where itâ\\x80\\x99s cheaper, where more people can buy insurance, and the quality goes up, then we will have failed. I admit that fully. I think we can hit those targets, and I believe you can do that,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThis is my third iteration of healthcare reform. I was involved in the Tenncare reform in the nineties in Tennessee, which was a failure,â\\x80\\x9d Roe recalled. â\\x80\\x9cI wrote an editorial in 2010, Raheem, about what I thought would happen to the ACA because of what I had seen almost 20 years before, and it exactly came true. â\\x80\\x9d  Roe argued that Obamacare has failed, according to its own standards and goals. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s intention was to increase access and decrease costs. Well, the costs have just gone through the roof. If we donâ\\x80\\x99t do something with the cost of health care in this country, nobody is going to be able to afford it,â\\x80\\x9d he warned.

       " 'LONDON  â\\x80\\x94   Britainâ\\x80\\x99s opposition Labour Party, already reeling after voters defied its advice and chose to leave the European Union, was plunged further into crisis on Tuesday when its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, overwhelmingly lost a   motion among his fellow lawmakers. The measure, which passed by a vote of 172 to 40, opens the way for a challenge to Mr. Corbynâ\\x80\\x99s leadership. It technically changes nothing, as Mr. Corbyn has refused to step down, though it underscores his loss of authority among colleagues in Parliament. â\\x80\\x9cI was democratically elected leader of our party for a new kind of politics by 60 percent of Labour members and supporters, and I will not betray them by resigning,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Corbyn said after the vote by Labour members of Parliament. â\\x80\\x9cTodayâ\\x80\\x99s vote by M. P. s has no constitutional legitimacy. â\\x80\\x9d He added: â\\x80\\x9cWe are a democratic party with a clear constitution. Our people need Labour Party members, trade unionists and M. P. s to unite behind my leadership at a critical time for our country. â\\x80\\x9d In the aftermath of Britainâ\\x80\\x99s vote to leave the European Union, Mr. Corbyn has been hit by the mass resignation of most of his leadership team. About   of Parliament members opposed leaving the union, including the overwhelming majority of Labour members and a smaller majority of members from the governing Conservative Party. Prime Minister David Cameron announced on Friday, the day after the referendum, that he would resign, and a power struggle has begun within the Conservative Party over who will succeed him. Given the disarray in British politics, many Labour lawmakers are worried that a general election may be held soon, and they fear that, with Mr. Corbyn at the partyâ\\x80\\x99s helm, they will face even bigger losses than they did in the May 2015 election. A   Mr. Corbyn was elected last year by an overwhelming majority of party members and supporters, but his support was very shallow among lawmakers. Discontent at Mr. Corbynâ\\x80\\x99s performance was crystallized by his campaign in the referendum on European Union membership, in which the partyâ\\x80\\x99s policy was to remain within the bloc. While Mr. Corbyn, a lifelong euroskeptic, did urge Labour supporters to vote to remain, critics regarded his campaign as lackluster, and his message as lukewarm. Mr. Corbynâ\\x80\\x99s staunch ally John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor of the Exchequer and the partyâ\\x80\\x99s top spokesman on economic issues, has said that Mr. Corbyn is â\\x80\\x9cnot going anywhere,â\\x80\\x9d and even vowed to run Mr. Corbynâ\\x80\\x99s campaign if there were a new election among Labour Party members. Supporters of Mr. Corbyn have called on his critics to either shut up or challenge him in a formal leadership contest. Under the Labour Party system, the final choice lies with party members and supporters, and Mr. Corbynâ\\x80\\x99s allies, who include influential   activists, are confident that he would win   despite some indications that support for him is weakening.',\n",
       " 'A new poll released from ABC/Washington Post shows some very good news for Democrats: not only is Hillary Clinton crushing Donald Trump, but President Obama s approval rating has hit a five year high   topping off at 56 percent of people who approve of him   a five point gain from the last poll conducted. Only 41 percent disapprove.The last time President Obama s approval rating was that high was when Osama bin Laden was killed in May 2011. It s also worth noting that the President s approval rating was taken in the immediate aftermath of the Orlando shooting, the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.But wait, there s more good news: not only does 56 percent of the American electorate approve of President Obama s presidency overall, 55 percent approve (42 disapprove) of his handling of the economy. Considering Trump likes to paint himself as the  best  man to handle the economy, the news should offer him and his campaign a much needed wake up call.As the Post noted:Obama is more popular now than Republicans George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush in the waning months of their presidencies. Although Obama s approval rating has not reached the level of former Democratic president Bill Clinton s in 2000, his standing suggests that he could be a relatively effective surrogate for Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.Just think about it   Clinton already has a huge lead over Trump, and that s before the very popular President Obama has hit the campaign trail. Once Americans see what will be leaving and what might be succeeding them, one could expect to see not only Clinton s poll numbers to rise, but Obama s as well.So what say you, Republicans? A healthy majority of Americans support the president and loathe your candidate. I don t think Republicans get to talk about the  will  of the American people anymore. They have no ground to stand on, no leverage, and no one seems to be taking them seriously anymore.President Reagan s final year approval high was 65 percent, just nine points higher than President Obama s. The President still has six more months, and considering how unpopular Donald Trump is becoming, America should expect to see it climb higher.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images',\n",
       " ' United States Â\\x96 Reformation or Fracture?\\nBy Thierry Meyssan Observing the US presidential electoral campaign, Thierry Meyssan analyses the resurgence of an old and weighty conflict of civilisation. Hillary Clinton has just declared that this election is not about programmes, but about the question Å¤Who are the Americans?Å¥. It was not for reasons of his political prgramme that the Republican leaders have withdrawn their support from their candidate, Donald Trump, but because of his personal behaviour. According to Thierry Meyssan, until now, the United States was composed of migrants from different horizons who accepted to submit to the ideology of a particular community . This is the model which is in the process of breaking down, at the risk of shattering the country itself. \" Voltaire \" - During the year of the US electoral campaign that we have just weathered, the rhetoric has profoundly changed, and an unexpected rift has appeared between the two camps. If, in the beginning, the candidates spoke about subjects which were genuinely political (such as the sharing of wealth or national security), today they are mostly talking about sex and money. It is this dialogue, and not the political questions, which has caused the explosion of the Republican party Â\\x96 whose main leaders have withdrawn their support from their candidate - and which is recomposing the political chess-board, awakening an ancient cleavage of civilisation. On one side, Mrs. Clinton is working to appear politically correct, while on the other, Å¤The DonaldÅ¥ is blowing the hypocrisy of the ex-Å¤First LadyÅ¥ to smithereens.\\nOn one side, Hillary Clinton promises male / female equality - although she has never hesitated to attack and defile the women who revealed that they had slept with her husband Â\\x96 and that she is presenting herself not for her personal qualities, but as the wife of an ex-President, and that she accuses Donald Trump of misogyny because he does not hide his appreciation of the female gender. On the other, Donald Trump denounces the privatisation of the State and the racketing of foreign personalities by the Clinton Foundation to obtain appointments with the State Department Â\\x96 the creation of ObamaCare not in the interest of citizens, but for the profit of medical insurance companies - and goes as far as to question the honesty of the electoral system.\\nI am perfectly aware that the way in which Donald Trump expresses himself may encourage racism, but I do not believe for a second that this question is at the heart of the electoral debate, despite the hype from the pro-Clinton medias. It is not without interest that, during the Lewinsky affair, President Bill Clinton apologised to the Nation and convened a number of preachers to pray for his salvation. But when he was accused of similar misconduct by an audio recording, Donald Trump simply apologised to the people he had upset without making any appeal to members of the clergy. The currrent divide re-awakens the revolt of Catholic, Orthodox and Lutheran values against those of the Calvinists, mainly represented in the USA by the Presbyterians, the Baptists and the Methodists.\\nWhile the two candidates were raised in the Puritan tradition (Clinton as a Methodist and Trump as a Presbyterian), Mrs. Clinton has returned to the religion of her father, and participates today in a prayer group composed of the army chiefs of staff, The Family, while Mr. Trump practises a more interior form of spirituality and rarely goes to church. Of course, no-one is locked into the systems in which they were raised, but when people act without thinking, they unconsciously reproduce these systems. The question of the religious environment of the candidates may therefore be important.\\nIn order to understand the stakes of this game, we have to go back and look at 17th century England. Oliver Cromwell instigated a military coup dÂ\\x92etat which overthrew King Charles 1st. He wanted to install a Republic, purify the soul of the country, and ordered the decapitation of the ex-sovereign. He created a sectarian rÃ©gime inspired by the ideas of Calvin, massacred thousands of Irish Papists, and imposed a Puritan way of life. He also created Zionism Â\\x96 he invited the Jews back to England, and was the first head of state in the world to demand the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. This bloody episode is known by the name of the Å¤First British Civil WarÅ¥.\\nAfter the monarchy had been reinstated, CromwellÂ\\x92s Puritans fled from England. They set up in Holland, from where some of them left for the Americas aboard the Mayflower (the Å¤Pilgrim FathersÅ¥), while others founded the Afrikaneer community in South Africa. During the War of Independence in the 18th century United States, we saw a resurgence of the struggle of the Calvinists against the British monarchy, so that in current manuals of British History, it is known as the Å¤Second Civil WarÅ¥.\\nIn the 19th century, the American Civil War opposed the Southern States (mainly inhabited by Catholic colonists) to the North (mostly inhabited by Protestant colonists). The History of the winning side presents this confrontation as a fight for freedom in the face of slavery, which is pure propaganda. The Southern states abolished slavery during the war when they concluded an agreement with the British monarchy). As a result, we once again saw the revolt of the Puritans against the Brititsh throne, which is why some historians speak of the Å¤Third British Civil WarÅ¥.\\nDuring the 20th century, this interior confrontation of British civilisation seemed over and done with, apart from the re-appearance of the Puritans in the United Kingdom with the Å¤non-conformist ChristiansÅ¥ of Prime Minister David Lloyd George. It was they who divided Ireland and agreed to create the Å¤ Jewish national homelandÅ¥ in Palestine.\\nIn any case, one of Richard NixonÂ\\x92s advisors, Kevin Philipps, dedicated a voluminous thesis to these civil wars, in which he noted that none of the problems had been solved, and announced a fourth confrontation [ 1 ].\\nI have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton will be the next President of the United States, or that if Mr. Trump were to be elected, he would be rapidly eliminated. But over the last few months, we have witnessed a large electoral redistribution within an irreversible demographic evolution. The Puritan-based churches now account for only a quarter of the population, and are swinging towards the Democrat camp. Their model looks like a historical accident. It disappeared in South Africa, and will not be able to survive much longer, either in the United States or in IsraÃ«l. Beyond the Presidential election, US society will have to evolve rapidly or split once again. In a country where the youth massively rejects the influence of the Puritan preachers, it is no longer possible to displace the question of equality. The Puritans envisage a society where all men are equal, but not equivalent. Lord Cromwell wanted a Republic for the English, but only after he had massacred the Irish Papists. This is how it is at the moment in the United States Â\\x96 all citizens are equal before the law, but in the name of the same texts, black people are systematically condemned, while attenuating circumstances are found for white people who have committed equivalent crimes. And in the majority of states, a penal condemnation, even for a speeding ticket, is enough to cancel the right to vote. Consequently, white and black people are equal, but in most states, the majority of black people has been legally deprived of its right to vote. The paradigm of this thought, in terms of foreign policy, is the Å¤two-stateÅ¥ solution in Palestine Â\\x96 equal, but above all, not equivalent.\\nIt is Puritan thinking that led the administrations of preacher Carter, Reagan, Bush (Sr. and Jr. are direct descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers), Clinton and Obama to support Wahhabism, in contradiction to the declared ideals of their countries, and today, to support Daesh.\\nA long time ago, the Founding Fathers built communities in Plymouth and Boston which were idealised in the US collective memory. And yet the historians are formal Â\\x96 they claimed to be creating the Å¤New IsraÃ«lÅ¥, and chose the Å¤Law of MosesÅ¥. They did not place the Cross in their temples, but the Tables of the Law. Although they are Christians, they attach more importance to the Jewish scriptures than the Gospel. They oblige their women to veil their faces and re-established corporaI punishment.

It turns out that after the stock market plunge and the feeding frenzy by the leftist media, ABC News got it wrong.

In fact, according to a video that was uncovered by citizen journalist Jack Posobiec, Obama s State Department told reporters during the Trump transition period, that the State Department didn t have any problem with the transition team meeting with any foreign officials (See video below). According to CNN correspondent Jim Acosta, the Obama regime actually gave the  go-ahead  for Flynn to have conversations with the Russian Ambassador: On Friday, the White House said that it was the Obama administration that authorized former national security adviser Michael Flynn s contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during President Trump s transition, according to CNN. Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Kislyak in the month before Trump took office, the first current or former Trump White House official brought down by special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into Russian election meddling. Court records indicate that his communications with Kislyak were directed by a Trump transition official, with multiple news outlets reporting that official was Trump s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.  They are saying here at the White House that Flynn s conversations with Sergey Kisylak were quote,  authorized  by the Obama administration,  CNN correspondent Jim Acosta said.General Michael Flynn released the statement below: After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of  treason  and other outrageous acts.

       " 'Just like Obamacare was pushed through, the Iran Nuke Deal has been pushed through in spite of it being VERY unpopular with the American people. Just like Obamacare, this deal hasn t even been read and vetted fully by the Congress. This is all about political ideology over what s best for the foreign policy interests of America. Shame on the Senate!U.S. Senate Democrats on Thursday blocked legislation meant to kill the Iran nuclear deal for a third time, securing perhaps the greatest foreign policy win of President Barack Obama s six years in office and clearing the way to implement the accord.By a 56-42 vote, the Republican-majority Senate fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance in the 100-member chamber.Despite an intense and expensive lobbying effort against it, all but four of Obama s fellow Democrats backed the nuclear pact between the United States, five other world powers and Tehran announced in July.With no more Senate votes this week, the result ensured Congress will not pass a resolution of disapproval that would have crippled the deal by eliminating Obama s ability to waive many sanctions.A resolution would have had to pass both the Senate and House of Representatives by midnight Thursday, and survive Obama s veto, to be enacted.The House, where Republicans also have a majority, never voted on the resolution, opting to pass three symbolic Iran-related measures that would not have affected the nuclear deal.Stephen Mull named U.S. coordinator on Iran nuclear deal Two presidential hopefuls, Senators Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, missed the vote after a debate in California last night in which Republicans bashed the Iran deal. Two others, Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham, voted with every other Senate Republican to advance the resolution.Four Democrats, Senators Ben Cardin, Joe Manchin, Robert Menendez and Charles Schumer, voted with the Republicans to advance the disapproval resolution all three times.Angry Republicans accused Democrats of denying the disapproval measure its due consideration in order to keep Obama from having to use his veto power.

Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a     percent disadvantage that our exporting companies are at, relative to the European ones. â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cProblems like that, we would like to address because those are part of the reason why we have a trade deficit with Europe,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThe other part of the reason is currency,â\\x80\\x9d Ross continued. â\\x80\\x9cThe euro has been very, very weak relative to the dollar. That, therefore, makes their competitive position much better than it would have been if the euro had stayed stable. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThere are quite a lot of issues that we have with Europe, and we would like to try to negotiate them,â\\x80\\x9d said Ross. â\\x80\\x9cIf we cannot make a sensible deal, we obviously wonâ\\x80\\x99t go forward with it. â\\x80\\x9d Ross looked beyond European complaints about the United Statesâ\\x80\\x99s pulling out of the Paris accords to see tough negotiations would be required to convince Europe to lower its tariffs. â\\x80\\x9cThe reality is, we do have a big trade deficit with Europe. The other reality is, a lot of that comes from automotive, and no small portion of that is this difference in tariff rates,â\\x80\\x9d he contended. Ross explained that coal was another U. S. industry disadvantaged by the Paris accords in favor of foreign competitors. â\\x80\\x9cBoth India and China, who are the two huge users of coal for electric utilities, both of them were permitted to use more   plants in the years going forward,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIn the case of China, on a total basis, they were able to increase their emissions for 13 years, and a lot of that would be coming from coal. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s ludicrous that U. S. coal would be shut down because we were agreeing to these very strict things, whereas even   more pollutive coal in countries like China would be allowed to flourish. That doesnâ\\x80\\x99t strike me as very balanced,â\\x80\\x9d said Ross. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. ',\n",

       " 'LOCKHART, Tex.  â\\x80\\x94   A   balloon carrying 16 people caught fire and crashed in Central Texas on Saturday, officials said, and the local authorities said no one had survived. The balloon crashed in a pasture near Lockhart, a town about 30 miles south of Austin, said Lynn Lunsford, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial reports from officials said the balloon had plummeted after catching fire in the air, but at least one witness said it might have struck   power lines before hitting the ground and bursting into flames. The accident occurred shortly after 7:40 a. m. Mr. Lunsford said. In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Lunsford said that officials were on their way to the site and that the National Transportation Safety Board had been notified. The agency will be in charge of the investigation. Mr. Lunsford said he did not know what had led to the crash or whether there had been a distress call. The Caldwell County sheriff, Daniel Law, said in a statement, â\\x80\\x9cIt does not appear at this time that there were any survivors. â\\x80\\x9d By late afternoon, investigators had yet to publicly identify any of the victims or their relations to one another. But local news reports, quoting unnamed sources, identified the pilot of the balloon as Alfred Nichols, known as Skip. He was listed as an owner and the chief pilot of Heart of Texas Hot Air Balloon Rides. Mr. Nicholsâ\\x80\\x99s Facebook page reflected two passions:   balloons and dogs. In the past two weeks, he had posted a YouTube video about a Russian balloonist who set a speed record for traveling around the world in a balloon (11 days) and an alert about   dog adoption days at the Austin Animal Center. On July 21, he posted aerial photos of a brilliant sunrise. â\\x80\\x9cAnother great flight in Houston,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote. He had two dogs, named Elmo and Joplin, and on Thursday evening, less than two days before the crash, he posted a photo of one of them resting on him. â\\x80\\x9cGoodnight to you too Elmo must you use me as your pillow?â\\x80\\x9d he wrote. By Saturday afternoon, the comment sections for that photo and the Facebook page of the balloon company were filled with condolences and remembrances. â\\x80\\x9cSkip, I shall for years to come be reminiscing about all of the awesome times we enjoyed at your Springdale Ln. Des Peres Missouri house and my Kirkwood Missouri house and tearing it up at all of the clubs my friend,â\\x80\\x9d Mark Grundmann wrote. â\\x80\\x9cYou will be missed. â\\x80\\x9d Amid the outpouring were urgent requests for people who lived near Mr. Nichols to check on Elmo and Joplin. At 3:52 p. m. a woman, Wendy Bartch, posted on the companyâ\\x80\\x99s page that the dogs were â\\x80\\x9cbeing cared for. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Bartch, Mr. Grundmann and others who posted on Facebook and Twitter did not respond to private messages. Voice mail messages left late Saturday afternoon at two phone numbers listed for the balloon company were not returned. Margaret Wylie, 66, who lives a   from the crash site, said she had seen the balloon explode into a fireball after it struck the ground on a neighborâ\\x80\\x99s property. She said she had been on her back porch when her dog â\\x80\\x9creally started raising the roof. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhen I looked over toward my neighborâ\\x80\\x99s property,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Wylie said, â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s about the time I saw flames shooting out sideways, and then just a fireball. At 66, thatâ\\x80\\x99s not something I want to see again. â\\x80\\x9d The crash occurred in a rural area less than an hour from Austin, in a large field scorched from the summer heat. Several big power lines atop towers ran east and west at the fieldâ\\x80\\x99s southern end. A few farmhouses were visible in the distance. Throngs of journalists arrived by late morning, but investigators had sealed off the perimeter and kept them from the spot where the balloon had fallen. Ms. Wylie said that based on what she had heard, she believed â\\x80\\x9cthe balloon hit the wires, and it caused the deflation of the balloon, and then it hit the ground. â\\x80\\x9d She initially heard a pop, she said, and then another that sounded like gunfire. â\\x80\\x9cI figured that was the balloon hitting the power line,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cBy the time I looked that direction, it was on the ground, and I heard a whooshing sound and an explosion. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Wylie said the balloon was so engulfed in flames that she did not see any passengers. She immediately called 911, she said. The red, white, blue and yellow balloon apparently separated from the basket and was stretched along the ground about a mile from the crash site. The power lines near the site belong to the Lower Colorado River Authority Transmission Services Corporation, The Austin   reported. A spokeswoman for the utility told the newspaper that two circuits were down after the crash, although no customers were without power. But neither she nor investigators could confirm whether the power lines had been involved in the crash. Erik Grosof, an official with the National Transportation Safety Board, said the crash had been classified as a major accident because of the â\\x80\\x9csignificant loss of life. â\\x80\\x9d A full investigative team from the safety board was to arrive later Saturday, he said, and the F. B. I. had been asked to help look at the evidence, a normal request after major accidents. Asked to confirm reports that 16 people had been killed, Mr. Grosof said, â\\x80\\x9cRight now, we have a number of fatalities. â\\x80\\x9d Sixteen deaths would make the accident one of the worst   balloon crashes in history, surpassed only by a crash in Luxor, Egypt, that killed 19 people in February 2013. In that crash, the balloon was sailing over archaeological sites at dawn when a fire caused an explosion in a gas canister and the balloon plummeted more than 1, 000 feet to the ground. Two people survived  â\\x80\\x94   the pilot and a passenger, who jumped from the basket from about 30 feet. Nineteen tourists died, including the wife of the surviving passenger. Before Saturday, the worst balloon accident in the United States occurred in August 1993 in Woody Creek, Colo. near Aspen, when a wind gust blew a balloon into a power line complex. The basket was severed and fell more than 100 feet, killing all six people aboard. Replying to a question at a news conference, Mr. Grosof said it was his â\\x80\\x9cunderstandingâ\\x80\\x9d that the balloon tour was run by Heart of Texas Hot Air Balloon Rides, based in New Braunfels. A person reached at its reservation service said the company offered flights in the Austin area coinciding with the sunrise. It also operates near San Antonio and in other areas. She declined to speak about the accident. The sheriffâ\\x80\\x99s statement said that a call had come in to the local law enforcement authorities after 7:40 a. m. reporting a possible vehicle accident. When emergency responders arrived, â\\x80\\x9cit was apparent that the reported fire was the basket portion of a   balloon,â\\x80\\x9d the statement said. Chris Oâ\\x80\\x99Neil, a National Transportation Safety Board spokesman, said investigators were expected to remain on the scene for a few days. Seven to 10 days after the field work is completed, he said, they will release a preliminary report. Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statement extending his condolences, calling the accident a â\\x80\\x9cheartbreaking tragedy. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOur thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families, as well as the Lockhart community,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThe investigation into the cause of this tragic accident will continue, and I ask all of Texas to join us in praying for those lost. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Former Baylor University President Kenneth Starr resigned as chancellor of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s largest Baptist university on Wednesday after being implicated in a report for not doing enough to probe sexual assaults by athletes. Starr, who rose to prominence for his exhaustive investigation of sex scandals surrounding then-President Bill Clinton, stepped down as chancellor but will keep his post as a professor in Baylorâ\\x80\\x99s law school. â\\x80\\x9cWith sorrow, earlier this morning, I announced my resignation effective immediately as chancellor of Baylor University as a matter of conscience,â\\x80\\x9d Starr said in an exclusive interview on ESPN televisionâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cOutside the Lines.â\\x80\\x9d Starr added he was unaware of what was happening but still accepted responsibility. â\\x80\\x9cWe need to put this horrible situation behind us,â\\x80\\x9d he said.  One of the victims of sexual assault at Baylor, identified only as â\\x80\\x9cSarah,â\\x80\\x9d told the show she sent a letter to Starr about being raped. She finds it hard to believe that he did not know about other sexual assaults. Baylorâ\\x80\\x99s board of regents accepted the resignation, the school said. Last week, the central Texas university in Waco removed Starr as president and fired head football coach Art Briles after an independent report found administrators mishandled sexual abuse cases involving football players. The investigation found actions by Baylor administrators directly discouraged students from reporting sexual assaults. In one case, the actions included retaliating against a complainant for reporting a sexual assault. â\\x80\\x9cWe were horrified by what we learned from the investigation and again express our public acknowledgment and deepest apologies,â\\x80\\x9d the board said in a statement on Wednesday. In March, a former student at Baylor brought a negligence lawsuit in federal court against the school, claiming it acted callously and indifferently after she was raped by a Baylor football player. In a separate scandal, Baylor football player Sam Ukwuachu was sentenced last year to six months in jail for sexually assaulting a fellow student in 2013. Starr became Baylorâ\\x80\\x99s president in 2010, promising to promote the schoolâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cgreat tradition in the Christian world.â\\x80\\x9d A former appeals court judge, Starr was appointed as a special counsel to investigate Clinton over a real estate investment and other matters. His probe widened to include Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and led to Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Republicans could not muster the two-thirds majority in the Senate needed to remove Clinton from office. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday gave companies an extra year to comply with an Obama-era regulation meant to crack down on corporations that try to minimize their U.S. tax bills by shifting profits abroad to countries with lower tax rates. The regulation, known in corporate tax circles as the â\\x80\\x9c385 rule,â\\x80\\x9d is intended to combat a tax-avoidance technique called earnings-stripping, in which multinational corporations transfer taxable income from a U.S. subsidiary to a foreign affiliate in the guise of tax-deductible interest payments on internal debt.   The rule, which Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is now reviewing as part of the Trump administrationâ\\x80\\x99s push for deregulation, seeks to eliminate the incentive for earnings-stripping by reclassifying certain loans as equity under Section 385 of the U.S. tax code. The change converts tax-deductible interest payments employed by the schemes into taxable stock dividends. Finalized last October, the regulation required corporations to file documentation on their internal loans with the IRS by a January 2018 deadline. In a public notice issued on Friday, the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service pushed the deadline back to January 2019. ',\n",
       " 'The Obama White House has issued hundreds of major regulations in an effort to reshape aspects of American life. Here are some of the most important: CLEAN POWER PLAN Last year, the Obama administration completed rules requiring the nationâ\\x80\\x99s existing power plants to cut, by 2030, emissions of greenhouse gases by 32 percent from 2005 levels. The rules were a central piece of the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s global effort to confront climate change. But a fierce legal challenge has stalled the rules, which are headed to a test in the Supreme Court. FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS In the summer of 2012, the administration finished rules to require cars and light trucks to get, on average, nearly 55 miles per gallon by 2025. Critics called the rules costly and unnecessary, but President Obama said they would reduce oil consumption by a total of 12 billion barrels by 2025. The regulations survived a legal challenge.   HOSPITAL VISITATION After reading about a lesbian social worker who had been kept from the hospital bedside of her partner, Mr. Obama issued an order in 2010 directing the creation of regulations to allow such visits. By the next year, new rules required all hospitals that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs to allow patients to designate visitors. PASSENGER BILL OF RIGHTS After a series of highly publicized cases in which airplane passengers were stranded for hours on the tarmac, the Obama administration in 2009 finished rules requiring airlines to return their planes to the gates within three hours or face steep fines. Airline executives called it government meddling the transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, called it a victory for consumers. REARVIEW CAMERAS In 2008, Congress passed a measure mandating that all cars have rearview cameras, reacting to tragic stories of children and older people being killed. For years, regulators and industry representatives balked at the cost, but in 2014, the Obama administration completed the regulations, which require backup cameras in cars and light trucks by 2018. FEDERAL WORKERS In a series of regulatory changes, Mr. Obama sought to improve the pay and benefits for federal workers and contractors. In 2014, he signed an executive order increasing the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $10. 10 per hour from $7. 25. The next year, he issued rules requiring up to seven days of paid sick leave for federal contractors. And this year, he increased the number of workers, including federal employees, eligible for overtime. NET NEUTRALITY In early 2015, the Federal Communications Commission, at Mr. Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s urging, issued rules that would regulate internet companies as utilities. The decision set off a battle among tech companies and digital content providers, and the issue is still in the courts. This year, a federal court upheld the administrationâ\\x80\\x99s rules, but the fight is likely to end up in the Supreme Court.    RULE Among the many new regulations governing the financial industry, one completed this year requires financial advisers and brokers to act in the best interests of their clients. Wall Street firms and the insurance industry fervently oppose the new rules, and they are likely to continue fighting them in court. HOME HEALTH AIDES Seeking to respond to changes in the way health care is provided at home, the Obama administration imposed rules requiring overtime and minimum wage protections for home health care workers. Opponents of the changes filed suit, and won an initial legal victory. But last summer, a federal appeals court reinstated the rules, which administration officials had called a basic protection for workers. DRONES The Obama administration, trying to balance the potential benefits of drones with the dangers to airplanes and privacy, issued new regulations in June outlining where and when the devices can be flown. The rules allow the use of drones in a wide range of businesses, but they ban their operation close to airports and require pilots to have passed a written test. Business officials hailed the rules as clearing the way for broader use of drones by companies, but privacy advocates said the rules did not go far enough.',\n",
       " 'The majority of America has already noticed   and figured it out a long time ago   that Donald Trump doesn t have a measured, steady reaction to anything. Widely known for his lack of mental and emotional stability, America s new failing president continues to horrify the nation (and the world) with his over-the-top, inappropriate reactions to even the most straightforward issues and disagreements. How Trump treats members of his own team is a perfect example of this.Last month, Trump made a controversial remark when he insisted that South Korea should pay for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), a missile defense system that would help keep North Korea at bay. As Trump frequently talks out of his a** and makes statements that have no basis in reality, he was quickly contradicted by his own National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster. In a public statement, McMaster stepped in and quickly assured the Korean government that the cost of THAAD would be taken care of by the United States. Apparently, Trump didn t take that too well.According to Bloomberg, it s just been revealed that Trump lost his sh*t over this and tore his own adviser a new one over the phone. Bloomberg reported: Trump was livid, according to three White House officials, after reading in the Wall Street Journal that McMaster had called his South Korean counterpart to assure him that the president s threat to make that country pay for a new missile defense system was not official policy. These officials say Trump screamed at McMaster on a phone call, accusing him of undercutting efforts to get South Korea to pay its fair share. Trump, as usual, was having a highly inappropriate reaction to his fragile ego being bruised. Apparently, this isn t even the first and only time something like this has happened. Bloomberg stated that in private, Trump calls McMaster the general undermining my policy  and appears regretful that he appointed him.The lack of trust and in-fighting we ve seen in the Trump administration   as well as Trump s lack of respect for the advisers HE appointed   is unprecedented on so many levels. This administration continues to be an embarrassment to this country, and most of us can t wait until this nightmare is over.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday defended his decision to settle lawsuits over his Trump University real estate seminars for $25 million, saying he does not have time to fight the fraud cases in court now that he is headed to the White House. The lawsuits cast a shadow over the Republicanâ\\x80\\x99s presidential campaign and led to one of the more controversial moments of his run for the White House when he claimed the judge overseeing two of the cases was biased because he was of Mexican ancestry.  While denying any wrongdoing, Trump agreed on Friday to pay $25 million to settle the lawsuits. â\\x80\\x9cI settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country,â\\x80\\x9d Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning.   New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has said over 5,000 students across the country were defrauded out of about $40 million, so Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s settlement of $25 million was around 60 percent of these estimated damages.  â\\x80\\x9cThe ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!â\\x80\\x9d He said in a second tweet. In announcing the settlement, Schneiderman said the deal followed repeated refusals by Trump â\\x80\\x9cto settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university.â\\x80\\x9d In a statement, Schneiderman called the settlement a â\\x80\\x9cstunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.â\\x80\\x9d Students had claimed they were they were lured by false promises into paying up to $35,000 to learn Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s real estate investing secrets from his hand-picked instructors. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s lawyers denied this. The deal covers three lawsuits relating to Trump University: two class actions suits in California and a New York case brought by Schneiderman. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego must still approved the settlement. During his election campaign, Trump said that Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents, could not be impartial because of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to control illegal immigration.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama exhorted fellow Democrats on Wednesday to preserve his legacy-defining healthcare law as Republicans moved ahead with their long-sought bid to scrap it in what Vice President-elect Mike Pence called the â\\x80\\x9cfirst order of businessâ\\x80\\x9d of Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s administration. The emerging Democratic strategy is to warn that Republicans risk throwing the entire U.S. healthcare system into chaos by moving to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, without a plan to replace it.  Republicans argue the system is already broken and that they will help more people gain coverage by repealing the law while working to minimize disruptions to those who depend on it. Both Obama and Pence visited Capitol Hill for closed-door discussions on Obamacare. Pence, the Indiana governor and a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives, met Republican lawmakers to plot the path forward on scuttling the law.  â\\x80\\x9cThe first order of business is to keep our promise to repeal Obamacare and replace it with the kind of healthcare reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government,â\\x80\\x9d Pence told a news conference. Down the hall from Pence, Obama, who hands over the presidency to Trump on Jan. 20, urged Democratic lawmakers to protect his signature domestic policy measure. He told reporters his message was: â\\x80\\x9cLook out for the American people.â\\x80\\x9d Democrats acknowledge they lack the votes needed to stop repeal legislation being pushed by Republicans, who will control the White House and both chambers of Congress when Trump takes office. But they are warning of the risks of the repeal legislation in hopes of spurring a public backlash against it. Without a replacement by Republicans, as early as 2018, the roughly 20 million people who gained insurance under the law could see their coverage in jeopardy. â\\x80\\x9cThe Republican plan to cut healthcare wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x98make America great again,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters, invoking Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign slogan. â\\x80\\x9cIt would make America sick again and lead to chaos instead of affordable care.â\\x80\\x9d Since the law was enacted, Republicans in Congress have voted more than 50 times to try to repeal all or part of it and conservatives have filed suits to try to invalidate it. Republicans criticize Obamacare as an excessive government intrusion into the healthcare market and contend it is harming job growth by adding burdens on businesses. Republicans on Wednesday stepped up their rhetorical attack on Obamacare, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying the law ruined the American healthcare system. Trump wrote on Twitter that Republicans â\\x80\\x9cmust be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases.â\\x80\\x9d    Pence said Trump would work with congressional leaders for a â\\x80\\x9csmooth transition to a market-based healthcare reform systemâ\\x80\\x9d through legislative and executive action.     Republicans have offered few details, however, on what a replacement for Obamacare would look like. Ryan said lawmakers would take action that did not â\\x80\\x9cpull the rug out from anybodyâ\\x80\\x9d and that the party had â\\x80\\x9cplenty of ideas.â\\x80\\x9d Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow said Republicans were â\\x80\\x9cpulling the string thatâ\\x80\\x99s going to unravel the whole (healthcare) system.â\\x80\\x9d Schumer said any effort by Republicans to shift the blame to Democrats would fail: â\\x80\\x9cThey want to repeal it and then try to hang it on us. Not going to happen. Itâ\\x80\\x99s their responsibility, plain and simple.â\\x80\\x9d  The House Republican Study Committee, composed of the most conservative members of the chamber, signaled they were aware of the risk of appearing not to have a plan and filed a bill on Wednesday that could constitute a replacement. House Republicans last year offered a proposal that would, among other things, provide refundable tax credits to help people afford their medical insurance premiums. Obamacare helped people obtain insurance by increasing funding to states to expand the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and providing government subsidies to help people obtain coverage from private insurers through government-run exchanges. Republican Senator Rand Paul, who is a doctor, joined the Democrats in voting against beginning consideration of the Obamacare repeal resolution. While Paul said he supported repealing the law, he added the current proposal would increase the government debt by $9.7 trillion in the next 10 years.  â\\x80\\x9cIs that really what the Republican Party represents?â\\x80\\x9d Paul said during Senate floor debate. The United States has a more complicated healthcare system than some other rich nations whose governments provide medical coverage. Many Americans get health insurance through their employers. Others buy policies directly from private insurers or are eligible for government-run programs for elderly and low-income people. About 29 million had no medical insurance in 2015, according to the most recent government statistics. The U.S. population tops 320 million people. Trump has vowed to protect some popular parts of Obamacare, such as barring insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions. ',\n",

In a video interview with Reuters ahead of the release of his new album â\\x80\\x9cEarth,â\\x80\\x9d the Grammy-award-winning singer-songwriter excused Donald Trump for using his music without asking his permission.  Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s use of â\\x80\\x9cRockinâ\\x80\\x99 in the Free Worldâ\\x80\\x9d during the Republican nomineeâ\\x80\\x99s campaign launch raised heckles last June. Youngâ\\x80\\x99s management company released a statement at the time saying that Trump was not authorized to use the song in the announcement of his presidential candidacy. Young now says he has nothing against Trump using his song. He just would have liked to have been asked.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0  â\\x80\\x9cThe fact that I said I was for Bernie Sanders and then he didnâ\\x80\\x99t ask me to use â\\x80\\x98Rockinâ\\x80\\x99 in the Free Worldâ\\x80\\x99 doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean that he canâ\\x80\\x99t use it,â\\x80\\x9d said Young, who has long lived on a ranch in California.  Young confirmed the Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign statement that the campaign had a license agreement with the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers for the right to play the recording. â\\x80\\x9cHe actually got a license to use it,â\\x80\\x9d Young said. â\\x80\\x9cI mean, he said he did and I believe him. So I got nothing against him. You know, once the music goes out, everybody can use it for anything.  â\\x80\\x9cBut if the artist who made it is saying you never spoke to them, if that means something to you, you probably will stop playing it. And it meant something to Donald and he stopped.â\\x80\\x9d Young says his support for Sanders in the election race was still strong, despite Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s lead in the contest for the Democratic nomination.  â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s the only one talking about the issues, about issues that matter to me, the issues on my mind - problems of corporate control of democracy and everything slipping away and not being able to have six major companies owning all the media in the United States,â\\x80\\x9d Young said.  Young has retained his Canadian citizenship. Although becoming a U.S. citizen would allow him to vote in the countryâ\\x80\\x99s November presidential election, he dismisses the notion.Â\\xa0 â\\x80\\x9cOh, that would be a big ruse. Iâ\\x80\\x99m a Canadian. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing I can do about that,â\\x80\\x9d he said.  But, he says, he will keep on talking politics, in his music and in public.  â\\x80\\x9cI vote in my own way, by making a lot of noise. If you donâ\\x80\\x99t want to listen to me, fine. If you donâ\\x80\\x99t want to vote like I would, donâ\\x80\\x99t. But I still have a voice.â\\x80\\x9d Youngâ\\x80\\x99s latest album, featuring live recordings of songs from throughout his career, will be released on June 24 on Reprise Records. ',\n",
       " 'Betsy DeVos announced upon her nomination as U. S. education secretary that she is â\\x80\\x9ccertainly not a supporterâ\\x80\\x9d of Common Core, even though the organizations she funded and supported through her service are avid proponents of the controversial education reform. [Now that she is sworn in, establishment politicians of both parties and the mainstream media would have Americans believe there is nothing DeVos or President Donald Trump can do to eliminate Common Core because it was adopted by the states.  Here are six actions DeVos could take to begin fulfilling Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s promise to get rid of the â\\x80\\x9cdisasterâ\\x80\\x9d he said is Common Core: #1: Assure states they can repeal Common Core without penalty from the federal government. President Trump and DeVos should not  â\\x80\\x94   and cannot  â\\x80\\x94   tell the states to repeal Common Core. To do so would mean they were accepting federal control of education  â\\x80\\x94   an area the Constitution reserves for the states and local governments. However, they can guarantee to states wanting to rid themselves of the boondoggle  â\\x80\\x94   and its affiliated standards programs  â\\x80\\x94   that they will not be penalized by the federal government for doing so. â\\x80\\x9cI hope Mrs. DeVos will realize that too many states have remained in Common Core because of all the federal pressure and threats  â\\x80\\x94   yes, including under ESSA [Every Student Succeeds Act]  â\\x80\\x94   that incentivize them to do so,â\\x80\\x9d American Principles Project (APP) senior fellow Jane Robbins tells Breitbart News. â\\x80\\x9cShe should vow to remove those pressure points and make it clear to states that the feds wonâ\\x80\\x99t penalize them in any way if they replace Common Core with good standards. If she does that, there may be a stampede for the exits. That would be a great thing for our students. â\\x80\\x9d #2: Issue guidance that says the Every Student Succeeds Actâ\\x80\\x99s (ESSA) provision that gives the education secretary power over state curricula and tests is not enforceable due to its extremely vague language. Establishment politicians often claim that ESSA  â\\x80\\x94   the most recent federal education law  â\\x80\\x94   has repealed the federal mandate for use of Common Core in the states. They base their pronouncements on the portion of ESSA that states: â\\x80\\x9cThe federal government is prohibited from   â\\x80¦     Mandating, directing, controlling, coercing, or exercising any direction or supervision over academic standards that states develop or adopt, including Common Core State Standards. â\\x80\\x9d Education scholars who have studied the law, however, assert ESSA neither repeals the Common Core mandate, nor prohibits the education secretary from coercing states into adopting the standards. In fact, these experts say ESSA actually does the opposite: it keeps states anchored to the controversial education reform. â\\x80\\x9cWithin the other 1, 060 pages of ESSA lurk the provisions that will keep states in Common Core, or something that looks very much like Common Core,â\\x80\\x9d Robbins and Indiana parent activist Erin Tuttle wrote at The Pulse 2016. â\\x80\\x9cThe Secretary wonâ\\x80\\x99t have to mandate anything, because the other parts of the bill contain the requirements for   â\\x80¦     â\\x80\\x98high standards,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d a phrase that has come to refer to Common Core. Robbins and Tuttle assert: [A stateâ\\x80\\x99s] plan must be â\\x80\\x9ccoordinatedâ\\x80\\x9d with 11 federal statutes, including the   Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act passed a year ago the Education Sciences Reform Act, which is all about collecting student data for research the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act, which adds to the Head Start requirements on preschool standards and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Authorization Act, which governs the NAEP test that will almost certainly be aligned to Common Core to hide the fact that Common   students perform poorly on NAEP. Requiring state plans and therefore state standards to coordinate with all these federal statutes means, as a practical matter, states will keep Common Core. â\\x80\\x9cESSA, which replaces NCLB, does mandate alignment,â\\x80\\x9d the authors write, quoting the ESSA law and translating the Common Core rhetoric: â\\x80\\x9cEach State shall demonstrate that the challenging academic standards are aligned with entrance requirements for   coursework in the system of public higher education in the State and relevant State career and technical education standards. â\\x80\\x9d This is simply another way of saying states must have â\\x80\\x9c  and  â\\x80\\x9d standards. And as made clear by the U. S. Department of Educationâ\\x80\\x99s own materials, â\\x80\\x9c  and  â\\x80\\x9d means Common Core. With ESSAâ\\x80\\x99s language decoded, the Federalistâ\\x80\\x99s Joy Pullmann also observes DeVos could issue guidance that says since ESSA â\\x80\\x9cgives the education secretary dictatorial power over state curricula and tests,â\\x80\\x9d but â\\x80\\x9cis so vague on its criteria for doing so, she finds the provision unenforceable until Congress specifies  â\\x80¦    â\\x80\\x9d Cato education director Neal McCluskey agrees Trump and a Republican Congress can ensure the regulations associated with ESSA donâ\\x80\\x99t â\\x80\\x9ccoerce the use of the Core or any other specific standards or tests. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThis has been a real concern,â\\x80\\x9d he explains. â\\x80\\x9cWhile the spirit and rhetoric surrounding the ESSA is about breaking down federal strictures  â\\x80¦    the statute includes language vague enough that it could allow federal control by education secretary veto. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cA Trump administration would likely avoid that,â\\x80\\x9d McCluskey says, and notes as well that Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s supporters â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t seem inclined to do what Beltway types tell them. â\\x80\\x9d #3: Put forward a plan to eliminate her department. As DeVos was confirmed in the Senate, Rep. Thomas Massie ( ) introduced legislation in the House that would eliminate the federal department of education. â\\x80\\x9cNeither Congress nor the President, through his appointees, has the constitutional authority to dictate how and what our children must learn,â\\x80\\x9d Massie said in a press release announcing his bill that is only one sentence long. With legislation to that end already introduced, DeVos could reach out to Massie and work with him and the billâ\\x80\\x99s other sponsors to dismantle her department in an organized manner. Pullmann, author of the upcoming The Education Invasion: How Common Core Fights Parents for Control of American Kids, tells Breitbart News, â\\x80\\x9cThe way to end Common Core is to end the superstructures that made it not just possible but inevitable. â\\x80\\x9d She urges Trump to send the statesâ\\x80\\x99 education dollars back to them to allow parents and local citizens to manage them as they see fit. â\\x80\\x9cEven though Common Core is technically   for federal influence, its successors will soon arise, and they will be worse than Common Core  â\\x80\\x94   unless President Trump fulfills his promise to his voters to end Common Core once and for all,â\\x80\\x9d she says. â\\x80\\x9cCommon Core is a hydra that consumes federal education dollars. The only way to kill it for good is to stop feeding it. Give us our own money and power back, and Common Core will never happen again. â\\x80\\x9d Hillsdale College president Larry Arnn recently confirmed to Breitbart News the ESSA still provides the education secretary with substantial power over the statesâ\\x80\\x99 education policy and standards. Arnn said he advises DeVos to devise a plan that ultimately addresses the question, â\\x80\\x9cWhat are we even doing here anymore? Letâ\\x80\\x99s get rid of this department. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf Betsy DeVos has a lot of power, then her successor would have that, too,â\\x80\\x9d he observed. â\\x80\\x9cSo, it would be better to get rid of her successor. â\\x80\\x9d #4: Address local control of education before school choice. While school choice is a good concept in general, some financial mechanisms that bring about the â\\x80\\x9cchoiceâ\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   such as school vouchers  â\\x80\\x94   are associated with high levels of regulation for the schools that agree to accept them. If DeVos works to achieve a federal mandate for vouchers, private and religious schools and homeschooling families could be required to submit to the Common Core standards and tests, as well as other federal education mandates. In a column at The Hill, Heartland Institute senior fellow Robert Holland explains the â\\x80\\x9cmagnitude of the oppositionâ\\x80\\x9d facing the new secretary from the grassroots parentsâ\\x80\\x99 groups opposing Common Core is not a factor to be ignored. Holland writes: As incongruous as it may seem, given DeVosâ\\x80\\x99 championing of a parentâ\\x80\\x99s right to select the best possible school for a child, parents organized in grassroots groups in all 50 states were among the most adamant critics of President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s nominee to lead federal education policy. On social media, these groups have names such as Stop Common Core in Florida (or New Jersey, or Oregon, or Michigan, or insert your own state). Their reach is enormous. The concern for many of these activists boils down to this: While choice may be desirable, it is not feasible when big government imposes uniform requirements on all schools for such central policies as curricula, testing, and teacher evaluation. Holland also urges DeVos to make local control of education a priority to pave the way for local school choice programs by announcing her intention to use her authority to free state and local governments from the oppression of federal control. â\\x80\\x9cA push for federal school vouchers in the current regulatory climate could backfire   either by flopping in Congress or, if enacted, drawing more private and religiously affiliated schools into the   Common Core web,â\\x80\\x9d he warns. â\\x80\\x9cHaving a dedicated school choice activist as U. S. education secretary does not alter the reality choices are properly made in communities and homes, not in Washington, DC. â\\x80\\x9d #5: Invite onto her staff education experts who are committed to the Constitutionâ\\x80\\x99s provision that the federal government has no authority in education. Holland calls attention to reports of Common Core supporters on DeVosâ\\x80\\x99s staff and observes grassroots parent activists â\\x80\\x9csee DeVosâ\\x80\\x99s longstanding support of powerful organizations that pushed Common Core standards on schools nationwide as rendering null and void any â\\x80\\x98choiceâ\\x80\\x99 that might emanate from Washington, DC under her leadership. â\\x80\\x9d He urges the new secretary to invite onto her staff as well â\\x80\\x9ceducation scholars who understand the federal government has no constitutional authority to dictate education policy,â\\x80\\x9d and that the U. S. education department should be â\\x80\\x9cphased out of existence. â\\x80\\x9d #6: Reverse the Obama administrationâ\\x80\\x99s regulatory gutting of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). In November of 2015,   Trump promised to close the loopholes in the federal privacy law to ensure studentsâ\\x80\\x99 personal information remains private. The Obama administration gutted FERPA in 2013, thus allowing private student and family information to leave schools without parental consent. In a Pioneer Institute paper titled â\\x80\\x9cCogs in the Machine: Big Data, Common Core, and National Testing,â\\x80\\x9d authors Pullmann and Robbins joined APP education director Emmett McGroarty to reveal the reason for the Obama administrationâ\\x80\\x99s desire to place a â\\x80\\x9cconditionâ\\x80\\x9d of student data collection upon states when they applied for 2009 federal stimulus money in Race to the Top applications: Federal law prohibits USED [U. S. Education Department] from maintaining a national student database  â\\x80¦     Since the absence of a national database impedes efforts to track citizens and manage the economy by manipulating the workforce, the federal government has for years been building the statutory structure to evade this prohibition. In fact, the law that essentially created the federal role in education also called for databases to monitor compliance with federal law in exchange for federal funds  â\\x80¦     The federal structure now incentivizes states to build identical â\\x80\\x94  and therefore sharable â\\x80\\x94  data systems, enabling a de facto national database. â\\x80\\x9cParents may not sue a school that discloses their childâ\\x80\\x99s PII [personally identifiable information] in violation of FERPA,â\\x80\\x9d the authors say.',\n",

They paid them fifteen hundred dollars and they re on tape saying be violent cause fights do bad things. Really?

When I was 3, the Taliban took over and forced me and my family to flee the country. I was too little to realize any of this. I still have a blurred image of an old orange bus, a loaf of bread, and rugged, dusty mountains. \\nAs I grew older, my mother explained that the bus belonged to my father, and we did not attempt to migrate to Iran at first. The Soviet invasion and the Afghan civil war taught people of my village how to protect themselves when crises get heated. The men would move their women and children to the dark, moist undergrounds immediately and make them stay there until the situation calmed down. We were not lucky enough to fit in the underground this time. We passed two days in a mountainâ\\x80\\x94the blurred mountain, in my mindâ\\x80\\x94and hopelessly moved toward Iran. \\nMy Afghan identity took my precious childhood from me. In Iran, I refrained from playing with other kids since they would mock my Afghan accent. I preferred to stay home to avoid hearing â\\x80\\x9cAfghani kesafat,â\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cAfghani Ashghal,â\\x80\\x9d literally meaning â\\x80\\x9cthe garbage Afghan,â\\x80\\x9d on the street. \\n  \\nWhen I turned 7, schools refused to let me attend because I was an undocumented Afghan migrant. I enrolled in a school run by refugees for refugees and did my primary schooling there. But the school lacked human and capital resources to offer classes beyond seventh grade, and an undocumented Afghan refugee could not get any further education. Constant insults, seclusion and deprivation of the right to a quality education were the gifts Iran provided me in my childhood. \\nIn 2001, upon the fall of the Taliban regime, my family and I returned to Afghanistan. At first glance, Kabul resembled anything but a city. Crumbled walls, broken glass, burned buildings, dusty roads and bullet shells on the streets all were evidence of the war. We did not expect a war-weary city to be any better. Yet one thing lured us into returning: safety and the hope for a better future. The Joint Way Forward deal between the European Union and Afghanistan misses this crucial point. \\nIn early October, the Afghan government and the EU signed this bilateral deal, which facilitates deportation of thousands of Afghan asylum seekers. In return, the EU promised to continue its generous aid package to Afghanistan. The deal promises job creation for returnees, emphasizes reintegration and resettlement programs, and ensures the safe return of vulnerable groups, in particular unaccompanied minors and women. \\nNone of these factors are enough to prevent hundreds of thousands of Afghans from taking the perilous journey toward Europe without a guarantee of security. After the fall of the Taliban, thousands of Afghan families returned to the war-torn country despite being aware of the existing limited opportunities. \\nPeace, hope for the future and stability were the factors which drove Afghans back to their homeland for the first time since 2001. The irony is that the lack of these very notions in 2015 made thousands of others abandon the country. With more than 11,000 civilian casualties, 2015 is the worst year in terms of security since the fall of the Taliban. \\nThe Joint Way Forward is based on the illusion that Afghanistan is safe. Kunduz, one of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s major cities, fell into the hands of the Taliban for the second time this year. The war forced hundreds to flee the city, while hundreds of others remained defenseless and stuck. \\nIn Badghis, a northwestern province, at least 60 police officers surrendered to the Taliban with their guns and resources. Three districts of Farah, a western province, already are ruled by insurgents. The Taliban rules many districts of Helmand province, and active war goes on in the city every so often. \\nNengarhar, Paktia, Paktika, Ghazni, and most other provinces are no better. Even the shortest highwaysâ\\x80\\x94such as the Kabul-Ghazni, or Kabul-Wardak, routesâ\\x80\\x94are controlled by the Taliban. Unknown numbers of people are being kidnapped or killed based on ethnic and religious reasons, or for having ties with foreign or government officials, on a regular basis. \\nAt least three bombs have exploded in different areas of Kabul since the deal was signed. By considering Afghanistan safe, despite the ongoing turmoil, the EU flinches from its humanitarian responsibility. \\nAfghans have fled uncertainty, insecurity and the abusive policies of their government with the hopes of establishing a better life for themselves in Europe. They never imagined they would risk their entire lives to be sold back to the government they just escaped. More than a mere failure of security in Afghanistan, the EU-Afghan deal is a failure of humanity. \\nMost EU countries warn their citizens against travelling to Afghanistan and mark it unsafe on their Foreign Affairs website. If it is not safe for EU citizens to spend a few days in Afghanistan, how is it safe for Afghans to live their whole lives there? Such deals reinforce double standards and spotlight how differently peopleâ\\x80\\x99s lives are valued in todayâ\\x80\\x99s world. \\nEuropeâ\\x80\\x99s decision to deport Afghans is hasty, unconstructive and shortsighted. Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s lives are being endangered for a second time. Statistics show that a great number of previous deportees already have attempted to return to Europe through Balkan routes. Many others lack social support to stay in Afghanistan after migrating to Europe from Pakistan or Iran. \\nThe deal is also unproductive for Europe, since it could lead to a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis. \\nThe current bilateral EU-Afghan deal will be a colossal failure unless the EU forces the Afghan government to prioritize security. Dealing with corruption and regaining peopleâ\\x80\\x99s trust is the next big move to push people back to their homeland. \\nThe developed world should not use aid as a negotiating tool to pressurize poorer nations. \\nPeopleâ\\x80\\x99s lives are not political capital. \\nNazifa Alizada of Afghanistan is a graduate of the Asian University for Women.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he had spoken with Myanmar s Aung San Suu Kyi and that she said she was working to get aid to the Rohingya Muslim areas in the Southeast Asian nation that were affected by violence. Suu Kyi  agreed with the need for immediate and improved access of humanitarian assistance to the region, particularly by the International Red Cross, and she conveyed that she is working toward that end,  McConnell said on the Senate floor. McConnell, whose Republicans control majorities in both houses of Congress, repeated earlier criticism of a resolution introduced in the U.S. Senate urging Suu Kyi to do more for Myanmar s ethnic minority Rohingya population, and lessening the chance that any such measure could pass. McConnell has had close ties to Suu Kyi for years. He said Suu Kyi, a Nobel prize laureate and de facto head of the government in Myanmar, also known as Burma, told him when they spoke on Wednesday that violations of human rights would need to be addressed. Attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts last month triggered an army operation that has killed more than 400 people, destroyed over 6,800 houses and sent nearly 400,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh. Suu Kyi has been a target of criticism from fellow Nobel laureates and religious leaders across the world for failing to condemn human rights abuses against the Rohingya during the military s fierce response to Rohingya militant attacks. The United Nations appealed Thursday for massive help for the nearly 400,000 who fled to Bangladesh, amid concern the number could keep rising unless Myanmar ends what critics denounce as  ethnic cleansing.  McConnell said Suu Kyi s position in the government was  exceedingly difficult  and that as a civilian, she had virtually no authority over the military. He warned that weakening her could interfere with the country s transition from decades of military rule. McConnell said he expected a briefing soon from Suu Kyi s office and that she was  trying very hard to improve conditions  for the Rohingya.  Burma s path to representative government is not at all certain and is certainly not over. And attacking the single political leader who has worked to further democracy within Burma is likely to hinder the objective over the long run,  McConnell concluded. ',\n",
       " 'In USA Today, journalist and author Michael Wolff explained to critics of Breitbart Senior Editor MILOâ\\x80\\x99s upcoming book Dangerous that â\\x80\\x9cthe publishing businesses is a business,â\\x80\\x9d pointing out that the publication of the book was inevitable given the profits that stood to be made. [â\\x80\\x9cThe traditional view, at least since publishing, in the late Victorian age, became a   and therefore respectable industry, is that if you publish it, you own it. You were not only legally responsible for it, but it firmly attached to your reputation,â\\x80\\x9d Wolff explained. â\\x80\\x9cThis led to protocols about editing, fact checking, and the development of a long cannon of journalism standards and ethics. It also led to the idea of publishing brands. What you published defined you in the community and in the marketplace. â\\x80\\x9d  The Yiannopoulos book is a particularly good example of the breakdown of this view. Book imprints were once the staunchest cultural gatekeepers, with issues of taste and sales closely twinned, and with the decision to publish resting, often, on a small group of editors, or even on a single shoulder. You knew who was responsible. But then a massive consolidation of the business occurred, mixing and mashing brands, and, with new financial dictates, in essence, commoditizing books. Any book that makes financial sense to publish, no matter its nature, will, practically speaking, be published by any publisher. Beyond a bookâ\\x80\\x99s financial bona fides, there is no real vetting, or editing, or concerns about taste. Most of the book industry is now a business focused on creating products â\\x80\\x94  often novelty products connected to a celebrity â\\x80\\x94  for specific market segments. A new crop of conservative publishers were suddenly making lots of money publishing conservative books. Hence, every major publisher hurried to established its own conservative imprint  â\\x80\\x94   the Yiannopoulos book is published by Simon  Schusterâ\\x80\\x99s Threshold Editions â\\x80\\x94  often run by liberals.

       " 'Sarah Palin made her first campaign appearance with Donald Trump on Tuesday, and it featured all of the authentic frontier gibberish we ve come to expect from the half-term governor and professional grifter.Let s dive into Shrieky McJutty s official endorsement of the GOP frontrunner, shall we? Mr. Trump! You re right! Back there in the press box, heads are spinnin . Media heads are spinnin . Nah. It s not that big a deal other than the fact that Sarah Palin single-handedly managed to make Trump s campaign even less serious than it already was. Put another way, Trump already acts like he s in the throes of dementia, and Palin s endorsement is like Trump getting bonked over his bewigged head with a cartoon-sized mallet. It s like a Twitter troll suddenly being defended in a flame war by the Twitter troll s drunken babysitter. Palin simply doesn t realize that everyone outside the GOP bubble watches her because she s stupid and says stupid things   not because she s any sort of political threat. Obviously.I was told, you know, warned left and right, you are gonna just get so clobbered in the press. You are just gonna get beat up. Chewed up n  spit out. N  you know, I m thinkin  And?Again, she s going to get clobbered because she has no business on a national stage discussing serious political matters. Why? Not just because she speaks as if she used Google Translate to transform her remarks into German, then translated from German back into what can only be described as horribly fragmented English, but chiefly because her speeches are mainly about her   how she always goes rogue and how the  lamestream media  hates her.To wit: When I was on stage nominated for veepee, and I got to say, [in creepy whisper voice] Yeeaaah  I ll go  Send me  You betcha  I ll serve Yes, she has a stellar record of serving   for part of her term, then quitting. And then when the McCain campaign tried to get her to stay on message, she  went rogue  and helped to doom her ticket. Good job.And now, I challenge you to sentence-diagram the following passage. Warning: it gets particularly gibberishy by the end.I m in it because just last week, we re watchin  our sailors suffer and be humiliated on a world stage, at the hands of Iranian captors in violation of international law because a weak-kneed capitulator-in-chief has decided that America will lead from behind. And he who would negotiate dills [sic] uh kinda  like with the skills of a  community organizer maybe organizing a  neighborhood tea. Well, he deciding that no, America would apologize and, uh, as part of the dill [sic] as the enemy sends a message to the rest of the world that they capture and we kowtow and we apologize and then we bend over and say  thank you, enemy? The sailors were hastily released unharmed. If Trump were president, the sailors would be dead because we d already be at war with Iran. If Palin were president, the sailors would be dead and we d be at war with the Hamburglar. [Trump] is beholden to no one but We The People. This is Trump she s talking about? Trump. Who s all about Trump, and who puts the name  Trump  on everything he touches? That Trump? Is beholden to the people? That s rich. No more pussyfootin  around. Our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best. Pussyfootin ? He is from the private sector, not a politician. Can I get a  hallelujuah!  Where in the private sector where you actually have to balance budgets in order to prioritize to keep the main thing the main thing. And he knows the main thing. Hallelujah? Did that just happen at a Trump rally? Jesus. Also, no, balancing budgets isn t about keeping the main thing the main thing, whatever the fuck that means. Oh, and yes, Trump is a politician. If one runs for president, one is a politician by default. Sorry. And then funny. Haha. Not. Funny. But now what they re doing is wailing,  Trump and, uh, uh, his trumpeters, well they re not conservative enough.  Oh my goodness gracious, what would the establishment know about conservatism? It s at this point when Jay P. Morgan, Jamie Farr and Rip Taylor would simultaneously gong her off the stage.How about the rest of us? Right-wingin , bitter clingin  proud clingers of our guns, our God, our religion, and our Constitution.How is it possible to be both resentful of Obama s  clinging  remarks, while also being proud of it? It can t be both. By the way,  bitter clingin  proud clingers  is my new favorite Palinism, right up there with the time when she said the role of the vice president is  position flexible. All told, this is an odd alliance Trump has formed here. Palin s favorability rating among Republicans hovers at around 27 percent. Again, among Republicans. I m not sure how this helps Trump, other than to further purge any remaining support he enjoys among serious Republicans. I m not sure that standing side-by-side with this bitter clingin  proud clinger is a smart move. But it s absolutely the funniest thing that s happened to Trump s campaign since he did this.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyfUu_fNQfM&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.',\n",
       " 'Putin Still Hopes to See Moderate Rebels Separated From Nusra Front by Jason Ditz, October 28, 2016 Share This \\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has officially rejected a request from his nationâ\\x80\\x99s Defense Ministry to endorse a resumption of Russian airstrikes against the Syrian city of Aleppo, after 10 straight days of no Russian airstrikes being conducted. \\nRussia launched a brief ceasefire in Aleppo last week, and extended it for four days. Even after it officially expired, they have not resumed strikes against the city, with officials saying they want to convince Western nations to separate the moderate rebel factions within East Aleppo from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. \\nSo far thatâ\\x80\\x99s not been working so well, as indeed separating the two was the primary goal of a weeklong ceasefire a month ago, and a public US call to separate never amounted to anything. After that, the idea appears to have been given up on by the US, and Russia has also sought Turkey and Saudi Arabiaâ\\x80\\x99s influence on the more moderate factions. \\nAs the rebel factions are launching a new offensive trying to brief the Aleppo siege, the Russian defense ministry has gone to the unusual step of publicly announcing their request to Putin, and Putinâ\\x80\\x99s very public rejection may suggest there is some debate within the Russian leadership on how to proceed.

The governor of Wisconsin is a love em  or hate em  kind of leader. Conservatives love him for making public sector unions pay more of their own benefits,  liberals hate him for daring to stand up to the powerful, organized mega-donors of the Democrat Party. Governor Walker is about to shake things up again in the blue state of Wisconsin, and liberals are not gonna be happy Gov. Scott Walker is moving forward with an effort to drug test some food stamp recipients, with testing expected to begin in as little as a year absent action from lawmakers or the federal government.Wisconsin s Republican governor has submitted a plan to state lawmakers for drug testing able-bodied recipients of the state s Food Share program. If the state Legislature doesn t object within 120 days, the plan will go into effect, though it will take at least a year for actual testing to begin.The program won t necessarily have a massive effect, however. The Walker administration estimated in October that only about 220 food stamp recipients statewide   or just 0.3% of able-bodied adults   would test positive in the first year. Employers have jobs available, but they need skilled workers who can pass a drug test,  Walker said in a statement.  This rule change means people battling substance use disorders will be able to get the help they need to get healthy and get back into the workforce. A year ago, Walker had asked then President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration to clear the way for the change in the food stamp program, which is overseen by the state but largely funded by federal taxpayers. So far that hasn t happened but a Walker spokesman said Monday that the governor believes the state can proceed without any federal action. Our position is we have the authority to implement the rule,  spokesman Tom Evenson said.The now-departed appointees of President Barack Obama didn t see it that way. In January 2017, right before Trump took over the White House, the former U.S. official in charge of the replacement program to food stamps said such testing would require a change in federal law. The law clearly does not allow it,  said Kevin Concannon, undersecretary at the federal Food and Nutrition Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Walker s  office forwarded that request to us and it was very clear, we consulted the legal counsels here and the law absolutely does not allow it. The Trump administration, however, may not see the issue in the same light.   Journal Sentinel ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday introduced legislation that would require border agents to obtain a warrant before searching data held on electronic devices belonging to Americans. The bill comes amid rising concern among civil liberties advocates about the effect on privacy of border searches of social media information, photos and email held on phones and laptops, which have grown in frequency in recent years and do not require a warrant.  President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s administration has fanned those concerns as it has sought to implement â\\x80\\x9cextreme vettingâ\\x80\\x9d security checks to restrict the flow of immigrants and refugees into the United States, an effort that has included consideration of a requirement that visitors share their social media passwords.  In addition to foreign visitors, media reports in recent months have suggested digital data of Americans re-entering the country has also been subject to added scrutiny. Numbers maintained by the Department of Homeland Security show border searches of phones have spiked in recent years, and official documents show the agency is able to extract data from some mobile devices, including those protected by passwords. Generally, U.S. law enforcement is required to obtain a warrant before it can search electronic devices of an American. A unanimous 2014 U.S. Supreme Court decision affirmed that a search and seizure of an arrested personâ\\x80\\x99s cell phone was unconstitutional without a warrant. But a so-called â\\x80\\x9cborder search exceptionâ\\x80\\x9d allowed federal authorities to conduct searches within 100 miles (160 km) of a U.S. border without a warrant. The Protecting Data at the Border Act would seek to limit the exception by requiring a warrant before searching devices at the border that belong to a U.S. citizen of permanent resident, except in some emergency circumstances. It would not apply to foreigners with valid U.S. visas who are entering the country or people who are applying for U.S. visas. The bill would also bar officials from delaying or denying entry into the United States if a person refused to share passwords, personal information numbers, social media or online account information or access credentials. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and Republican Senator Rand Paul sponsored the legislation, while Democratic Representative Jared Polis and Republican Representative Blake Farenthold introduced the bill in the House. Despite attracting bipartisan sponsors, it was not clear whether the measure would be able to earn enough Republican support to advance in the Republican-controlled Congress. â\\x80\\x9cA border stop shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be an excuse for extreme surveillance such as downloading the entire contents of your phone,â\\x80\\x9d said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a Washington civil liberties organization that supports the legislation.

So the Washington Post (and Wolff) is calling her and other purveyors of lies out in their front-page motto. Conway s response was to first say,  I m not the darkness! Then she said: It s what I tell small children: Just because somebody says something doesn t make it true, and it s a great lesson for everyone. Miss Bowling Green Massacre is defending herself against accusations of lies by pointing out that people lie. The irony! It hurts!

       " 'MIAMI  â\\x80\\x94   Alexis K. Manigo closes her eyes to sleep and sees images of her mother. She recalls the doting mom who took her to zoos, aquariums and SeaWorld, and marvels at how fortunate she was to have a parent who loved her unconditionally. But those memories are now complicated by an extraordinary drama that has played out over the week since Ms. Manigo, 18, found out that she had been spirited away as a newborn from a hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. that her real name is Kamiyah Mobley, and that the woman she still thinks of as her mother has been charged with her abduction. She is still trying to make sense of it all. She met with her birth parents, Craig Aiken and Shanara Mobley, last weekend. But in her first newspaper interview since the case made headlines on Friday, she said she did not have a cross word for Gloria Williams, the woman who now stands accused of lurking for more than a dozen hours around a Jacksonville hospital on the July 1998 day Ms. Manigo was born, looking for a newborn to snatch. â\\x80\\x9cI feel like I was blessed,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Manigo said in a telephone interview. â\\x80\\x9cI never had a reason to question a blessing like that, someone loving you so much. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Manigo said she never had cause to doubt her mother in the rural South Carolina community where she grew up. But the police say someone else clearly did. At least two tips were called in late last year to the Jacksonville Sheriffâ\\x80\\x99s Office, some 200 miles away, where the police still had an open   case. â\\x80\\x9cA woman posing as a health care worker approached a young mother, then 16, with a newborn, and walked out of what was then University Medical Center with a baby and disappeared,â\\x80\\x9d Sheriff Mike Williams recounted at a news conference on Friday. The woman wore flowered hospital scrubs and carried a purse, which seemed odd. â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s she doing with a pocketbook?â\\x80\\x9d the babyâ\\x80\\x99s grandmother, Velma Aiken, recalled thinking in a report on the 10th anniversary of the case. â\\x80\\x9cThat lady could be stealing your baby. â\\x80\\x9d She thought, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m picking up a bad spirit. â\\x80\\x9d The woman spent hours with the family and then left with the baby, saying the girl had a fever and needed some tests. They never came back. â\\x80\\x9cIn the 18 years since that childâ\\x80\\x99s abduction, we have received and followed up on more than 2, 500 investigative leads,â\\x80\\x9d Sheriff Williams said, recalling an â\\x80\\x9cintense, lengthy, detailed, multiagency investigation. â\\x80\\x9d The family reached a legal settlement with the hospital two years later. And every year, the babyâ\\x80\\x99s mother would wrap a slice of birthday cake in tinfoil and freeze it. The case also went cold. Late last year, two fresh tips came in, and they led   detectives to Walterboro, S. C. a town of just 5, 000 people an hour west of Charleston. There, the investigators found a young woman who had been born on July 10, 1998, just like Kamiyah, but with a different name. Her documents were fraudulent, Sheriff Williams said, and â\\x80\\x9cinterviews with peopleâ\\x80\\x9d supported the idea that the two women were one and the same. The detectives asked Ms. Manigo for a DNA sample. â\\x80\\x9cAnd of course, like someone who understands their rights, she said: â\\x80\\x98What is this about? Do you have a warrant? â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said her lawyer, Justin Bamberg. The investigators returned with one. Ms. Manigo gave her DNA and in short order found out the truth: She was someone elseâ\\x80\\x99s child. Conscious of the fact that the woman she knew as her mother will now face trial for kidnapping, Ms. Manigo is unwilling to discuss a lot about the case, including how her family life finally unraveled. She does not want to say which name she plans to use in the future, and she insisted that she was never suspicious  â\\x80\\x94   although the police said otherwise at a news conference on Friday. â\\x80\\x9cI never had any ID or a driverâ\\x80\\x99s license, but other than that, everything was totally normal,â\\x80\\x9d she said. She did acknowledge being stymied a few months ago when she applied for work at Shoneyâ\\x80\\x99s but lacked the Social Security card she needed to get the job. â\\x80\\x9cShe took care of everything I ever needed,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Manigo said. â\\x80\\x9cI never wanted for anything. I always trusted her with it. â\\x80\\x9d She said that Ms. Williams was not mentally ill and that she had not been overprotective. Ms. Williams worked at a Navy yard handling medical records and was set to receive her masterâ\\x80\\x99s degree this year. â\\x80\\x9cShe was a very smart woman,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Manigo said. Ms. Manigo met her biological parents on Saturday, at a teary reunion followed by a   trip to the mall. She called them Mom and Dad, because she figured those were words they had been waiting a long time to hear. â\\x80\\x9cYou can tell she has a lot of love for me as well,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Manigo said about her biological mother, who could not be reached for comment. â\\x80\\x9cThey donâ\\x80\\x99t feel like  . They feel like distant family. â\\x80\\x9d She said she felt an innate trust toward them. Her father, Craig Aiken, told   in Jacksonville the meeting was â\\x80\\x9cbeautiful. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a feeling that you canâ\\x80\\x99t explain,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Mr. Bamberg, Ms. Manigoâ\\x80\\x99s lawyer, said there were now practical matters to attend to. She needs identification and a Social Security card. A large financial settlement was won on her behalf, and now that she is 18, it has to be determined whether any money was set aside for her. â\\x80\\x9cYou have incidents where peopleâ\\x80\\x99s lives were turned upside down, and then you have this: a life that was essentially erased,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Among the few people who can really relate to what Ms. Mobley is experiencing is Sarah Cecilie Finkelstein Waters. When she was a preschooler living with her mother, her father took her, and it was not until she was a teenager and saw her picture on a milk carton that she realized that she had been abducted. Ms. Waters eventually reconnected with her mother, distanced herself from her father and, as an adult, befriended other survivors of abduction. â\\x80\\x9cIt turns reality upside down and forces you to question every core thing you ever believed to be true,â\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Waters, now 46, married and a mother herself, living on Long Island. â\\x80\\x9cYou have to really struggle to come to terms with all these shades of gray, make sense of them, and hopefully some sort of peace with them: What is reality? Who is wrong and whoâ\\x80\\x99s right? Who really loves me? Who is telling the truth?â\\x80\\x9d Since Ms. Mobley seems devoted to the woman she believed was her mother, Ms. Waters said, â\\x80\\x9cShe needs to feel like she can embrace her new family without giving up on her old one. â\\x80\\x9d Geoffrey Greif, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Social Work who has studied abduction cases, said some psychological effects were common. â\\x80\\x9cAs you connect the dots over a period of time, itâ\\x80\\x99s a pretty normal reaction to become upset with the abductor, and a child who was abducted may have trouble developing intimacy and trust with other people,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cWe often see a degree of anger at the parents who were left behind, even if thatâ\\x80\\x99s not really justified, like â\\x80\\x98Why didnâ\\x80\\x99t you look harder for me? â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d But cases like Ms. Mobleyâ\\x80\\x99s are quite rare. Thousands of children are abducted each year, but usually the abductor is a family member, most often a parent. And abduction by a stranger often has a tragic end  â\\x80\\x94   sexual abuse, death or both. A spokesman for the hospital, which is now called UF Health Jacksonville, said the medical center was thrilled that the young woman had been found. â\\x80\\x9cWe share in the joy of this discovery with her family, the northeast Florida community, and law enforcement as they celebrate this news,â\\x80\\x9d the spokesman, Dan Leveton, said in a statement. â\\x80\\x9cLike most hospitals, we currently have specialized,     security measures in place, both   and electronic, to protect newborns and their mothers. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Manigo, somehow, has taken it all in stride so far. And for her, Mom still means Ms. Williams, who is being held at the Jacksonville jail without bond. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I close my eyes, I see my mother,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cI like that. I love that. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s signature contribution to world culture is its popular music, and the characteristic mood of that music is the melancholy yearning called saudade. That is not the mood NBC wants you in while youâ\\x80\\x99re watching its coverage of the 2016 Rio Olympics, however. In its broadcast of the Gamesâ\\x80\\x99 opening ceremony on Friday night  â\\x80\\x94   meant to set the tone for more than 6, 500 hours of television and digital coverage over the next   weeks  â\\x80\\x94   the network was intent on getting the party started. During NBCâ\\x80\\x99s long introduction to the ceremony, the emphasis was on the physical beauty of the Brazilian landscape and its often scantily clad Brazilian bodies, and on the many styles of dancing abandon the countryâ\\x80\\x99s music inspires. Despite the controversies and fears that have dogged the Rio Games, the city was ready to throw â\\x80\\x9ca massive party,â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith Vieira, one of three â\\x80\\x9cTodayâ\\x80\\x9d hosts recruited to narrate the ceremony, along with Matt Lauer and Hoda Kotb. Ms. Kotb, the designated fun one, squealed, â\\x80\\x9cDid somebody say party?â\\x80\\x9d When the canned intro ended, more than an hour after the ceremony had actually started, a nearly subliminal string of words on screen painted the clichÃ©d picture of (sanitized) hedonism that NBC wants as a background for its broadcast: music, color, flavor, passion, beaches, samba, carnival, futbol. The hosts did not ignore the scandals  â\\x80\\x94   economic, political, health and doping  â\\x80\\x94   that have dominated the   to the Games, but their references were predictably few and faint. About the absence of the Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, who faces an impeachment trial, â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s complicatedâ\\x80\\x9d was as direct as it got. But NBC couldnâ\\x80\\x99t airbrush out the parts of the ceremony itself that took on larger concerns. Less visually and choreographically impressive than Zhang Yimouâ\\x80\\x99s spectacular show in Beijing in 2008, and less   than London in 2012, the production Friday night had a winning earnestness. A long, powerful section represented Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s history of slavery, and the culmination of the ceremony was a bald warning of the dangers of global warming to coastal cities like Rio de Janeiro. NBCâ\\x80\\x99s   decision to   the broadcast of the ceremony by an hour  â\\x80\\x94   starting at 8 p. m. Eastern  â\\x80\\x94   probably had little or no effect on what we saw. There did not appear to be any significant disturbances or glitches at the stadium that needed to be smoothed over. What the network really gained by delaying the ceremony was more viewers for its nakedly promotional introductory  . NBC featured the American athletes it is counting on for story lines, like the swimmer Michael Phelps and the sprinter Allyson Felix and an intrusive, embarrassing promo touted NBCâ\\x80\\x99s most prominent announcers. The nadir of the evening was a   segment, positioned just before the start of the opening ceremony, that was ostensibly about Olympic golf but was really a plug for the   Golf Channel. The ceremony, when it arrived, was firmly in the approved international style that combines elements of Cirque du Soleil, â\\x80\\x9cThe Lion King,â\\x80\\x9d American football halftime shows, political conventions,   film (particularly the director Terrence Malick) and the fireworks of the artist Cai  . An irregularly shaped section of the floor of the MaracanÃ£ stadium served as stage and screen. Watching theatrical effects that are scaled for a large stadium in the confines of a television screen is always problematic  â\\x80\\x94   youâ\\x80\\x99re too close to the action and at the same time youâ\\x80\\x99re missing the immersive effects of lights and sound. The opening act, a countdown to the ceremony involving lots of mylar, looked like hundreds of giant bags of Jiffy Pop popcorn getting ready to burst. During a tribute to the Brazilian aviation pioneer Alberto   in which white boxes were tossed from hand to hand, the cameras were too close to capture the cascading effect. But other segments, like the sprouting of a rainforest from the stadium floor, and the slave march  â\\x80\\x94   for which dancers wore large blocks, like parking boots, on their feet  â\\x80\\x94   probably came across better on the screen, communicating some of the wonder that the stadium spectators must have felt. The ceremonyâ\\x80\\x99s most striking moment, however, involved a lone figure on a bare stage: the Brazilian model Gisele BÃ¼ndchen, taking the longest catwalk ever, along the length of the MaracanÃ£ floor. Then there were the parts that were completely inexplicable without a program, like a wild number with masses of dancers in a multicolored,   mosh pit. NBC thoughtfully cut in a prerecorded interview with Daniela Thomas, one of the ceremonyâ\\x80\\x99s creative directors, explaining that it was a representation of Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s divides of class and race, as well as a celebration of diversity. Eventually, NBCâ\\x80\\x99s cameras found and kept returning to Ms. Bundchen dancing in the stands, an image they clearly preferred. The strange fate of Olympic opening ceremonies is that they inevitably segue into the visually monotonous parade of nations, two hours of waves, hideous national costumes and rampant selfie taking. Rio tried to put its stamp on the parade by having the teams led into the stadium by bicycle carts of the kind that ferry supplies around big beach resorts. The parade requires more of the announcers, and the â\\x80\\x9cTodayâ\\x80\\x9d crew, unusually subdued during the ceremony, nimbly recited demographic and historical facts. These skewed toward American interests: â\\x80\\x9cRootsâ\\x80\\x9d opens in Gambia. Alexander Hamilton was born in St. Kitts and Nevis. As long and featureless as the parade may be, it is also inspiring and heartwarming, the loud cheers for a new team representing refugees (and for the very well muscled and oiled Tongan flag bearer) balancing the occasional cuts to American team members chanting â\\x80\\x9cU. S. A. !â\\x80\\x9d Conveniently for NBC, the home nation danced in last, a   samba line bouncing along to the best   music any nation has offered. With her mind on those 6, 500 hours of actual athletics still to come, the rights to which cost NBC north of $1 billion, Ms. Vieira cautioned: â\\x80\\x9cThis is not the party. You havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen anything yet. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'United Airlines on Tuesday faced a spiraling crisis from videos showing a passenger being dragged off an airplane, as consumers threatened a boycott of the airline and lawmakers called for an investigation. By the afternoon, after more than a day of changing statements, Unitedâ\\x80\\x99s chief executive apologized and promised a review of its policies. â\\x80\\x9cNo one should ever be mistreated this way,â\\x80\\x9d Oscar Munoz, the companyâ\\x80\\x99s chief executive, said in a statement. But the videos had already cast an unwelcome light not just on United, but on the airline industryâ\\x80\\x99s efforts to maximize profits. As companies push to make money from baggage fees, seat reservations and other services that were once included with a basic plane ticket, the videos added the potential for an even harsher indignity: sitting in a seat with a ticket and getting physically ejected from the airplane. The passenger, Dr. David Dao, was identified late Tuesday in a statement from his lawyers, who said he was undergoing treatment in a   hospital for his injuries. Some videos had showed him with a bloody face. On social media, the firestorm swept around the world. Chinese social media users accused United, which does a lot of business in the country, of racism by targeting Dr. Dao, who appeared to be Asian. In the United States, customers showed pictures of their United loyalty or credit cards cut into pieces. And lawmakers called for an investigation. â\\x80\\x9cThe last thing a paying airline passenger should expect is a physical altercation with law enforcement personnel after boarding, especially one that could likely have been avoided,â\\x80\\x9d the four top leaders of the Senate commerce committee said in a letter on Tuesday to Mr. Munoz. The disturbing images of a passenger being violently ejected from an airplane by security officers rippled across a consolidating industry. Today, four major airlines account for about 80 percent of domestic air travel. In recent years, as the consolidation has increased, passengers have been forced into a host of policies that ding their wallet and their comfort. But social media has proved to be a powerful outlet for complaints. United drew quick criticism for its initial response to the Sunday evening incident, with many people calling it tone deaf. On Monday, when Mr. Munoz apologized for having to â\\x80\\x9c  these customers,â\\x80\\x9d the internet saw that as a joke. â\\x80\\x9cNice to know â\\x80\\x98 â\\x80\\x99 on United now means â\\x80\\x98drag you violently out of your seat,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d one woman posted on Twitter. A few hours later, United seemed to go on the offensive when it circulated a letter in which Mr. Munoz appeared to blame Dr. Dao, saying he â\\x80\\x9cdefiedâ\\x80\\x9d the officers. Finally, on Tuesday afternoon, the airline changed course again, with Mr. Munoz saying that United would take â\\x80\\x9cfull responsibilityâ\\x80\\x9d for the situation. â\\x80\\x9cBetter late than never, but the sentiment certainly rings a bit hollow when it follows two previous failures and 36 hours of intense public pressure,â\\x80\\x9d said Jeremy   a principal at the corporate public relations firm Group Gordon. â\\x80\\x9cThe        apology isnâ\\x80\\x99t generally a winning strategy. â\\x80\\x9d For United and Mr. Munoz, who just last month was named Communicator of the Year by PR Week, a trade publication, the videos have turned into a crisis. They come on the heels of another incident about two weeks ago in which the airline was forced to defend itself about what some saw as a sexist policy after it barred two teenage girls wearing leggings from a flight. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s fair to say that if PR Week was choosing its Communicator of the Year now, we would not be awarding it to Oscar Munoz,â\\x80\\x9d the trade publication said on Tuesday. After tumbling during the day, Unitedâ\\x80\\x99s stock ended Tuesday down 1. 13 percent. Perhaps more than anything, the videos hit a nerve because they highlighted the ability of airlines to remove paying customers when the companies overbook flights. Tina Stringer, a   United customer from Chicago, was in New Orleans on vacation when the video surfaced. Before boarding her return flight on Tuesday, she said, â\\x80\\x9cI was just praying that nothing bad would happen. â\\x80\\x9d Happily, her flight back to Oâ\\x80\\x99Hare International Airport was uneventful. But the video made an impression  â\\x80\\x94   so much so that she pulled up news coverage of the incident on her cellphone while waiting for her cousin to pick her up. â\\x80\\x9cI think it was kind of scary,â\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Stringer, 45, â\\x80\\x9cbecause innocent people are just trying to get where they want. â\\x80\\x9d Ken Lewandowski, 63, of Crystal Lake, Ill. who had just flown home from Florida on United, had also seen the video. â\\x80\\x9cThere was a better way to do it,â\\x80\\x9d he said. United, on Tuesday, appeared to backtrack from prior statements that the flight with Dr. Dao aboard  â\\x80\\x94   heading from Oâ\\x80\\x99Hare in Chicago to Louisville, Ky.  â\\x80\\x94   was overbooked. Instead, Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for United, said the flight was full and then crew members, who were scheduled to operate a flight Monday morning from Louisville to Newark, N. J. needed seats on the plane. If the crew members had not been allowed to board, Ms. McCarthy said, the Monday morning flight would have been canceled. Still, it is not uncommon for airlines to overbook, or sell more tickets than they have seats. At that point, they try to get people to voluntarily change their plans  â\\x80\\x94   or, if there are no takers, force them to change. The odds of actually being booted from a flight involuntarily are quite low. Last year, airlines involuntarily bumped about 40, 600 people, a fraction of the roughly 660 million passengers who flew, according to data from the Department of Transportation. About 434, 000 people voluntarily gave their seats up for compensation. Airlines have oversold flights for decades, expecting several people not to show up for a flight. It is a strategy that ensures a full plane and maximizes profits for airlines. Typically, airlines begin bargaining with passengers at the gate, offering travel vouchers of $400 to $600. In the United States, compensation maxes out at $1, 350, but experts say the reward offers rarely get that high. While the Transportation Department said it was investigating whether the airline complied with rules regarding overbooking, it noted that each airline sets its own system and procedures for deciding whom to bump. United said it would review its overbooking policies. Many politicians also called for the rules to be reviewed. In addition to their letter to Mr. Munoz, leaders of the Senateâ\\x80\\x99s commerce committee, John Thune, Bill Nelson, Roy Blunt and Maria Cantwell, also demanded a full accounting of the incident from the Chicago Department of Aviation. Some airlines choose to bump the passengers who paid the lowest fares, while some choose the last passengers to check in. The Department of Transportation requires airlines to give involuntarily bumped passengers â\\x80\\x9ca written statement describing their rights and explaining how the carrier decides who gets on an oversold flight and who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d according to its consumer guide. Although most airlines do not like to discuss how many involuntary customers they bump, Gil West, the chief operating officer of Delta, did just that in a December 2015 presentation to investors and analysts. â\\x80\\x9cThis is probably the most painful customer experience you could ever have, right?â\\x80\\x9d Mr. West said. â\\x80\\x9cYou paid for your ticket, you show up at the gate,â\\x80\\x9d and the airline says you cannot fly. Unitedâ\\x80\\x99s website says that when the airline cannot find volunteers, it will â\\x80\\x9cdeny boarding to passengers in accordance with our written policy on boarding priority. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. McCarthy would not share the written policy. She said its agents follow a protocol for determining who will be selected, aiming to avoid families traveling together and unaccompanied minors. United also tends to protect people with connecting flights, those with mileage status through frequent flier or credit card programs, fare buckets and â\\x80\\x9ca whole number of things,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Ms. McCarthy said the protocol was followed on Dr. Daoâ\\x80\\x99s flight. Three passengers got off the plane. But Dr. Dao did not give up his seat, and he was forcibly removed  â\\x80\\x94   dragged down the airplane aisle, his glasses askew, face bloodied  â\\x80\\x94   by several security officers. One of the officers has been placed on leave, according to the authorities. Crisis communications experts criticized Unitedâ\\x80\\x99s initial response to the event. There are â\\x80\\x9ccountless metrics you could look at to justify the cost of a higher compensation offer for those passengers on that plane,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr.   pointing to the price of crisis management, the loss in stock value, the potential for lost business and even the time of Mr. Munoz, who makes at least $1. 2 million a year. Other corporations also chimed in. Emirates posted a short video to Twitter, criticizing Mr. Munoz for a snide remark he had made about Emirates and pointing out its customer satisfaction accolades. The Twitter account for   said on Monday night that â\\x80\\x9cvolunteerâ\\x80\\x9d means â\\x80\\x9csomeone who does something without being forced to do it. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe recognize that our response yesterday did not reflect the gravity of the situation,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. McCarthy said. â\\x80\\x9cAnd for that we also apologize. Our focus now is looking ahead and making this right. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'TEHRAN  â\\x80\\x94   For all of Iranâ\\x80\\x99s attractions  â\\x80\\x94   breathtaking scenery and numerous World Heritage sites, among other things  â\\x80\\x94   there are plenty of downsides to vacationing in the Islamic republic. Alcohol is forbidden. There is very little night life, at least in public. All women, including visiting foreigners, are obliged to wear a head scarf. Then there are Iranâ\\x80\\x99s politics: its strident   stance seemingly random arrests of people with dual citizenship hundreds of executions every year and a rather loose definition of human rights. None of that has changed, but suddenly Iran is a booming destination for Europeans seeking an adventurous vacation, particularly people from Spain, France and Scandinavia. Even tourism from the United States is picking up, industry insiders say. â\\x80\\x9cI only knew Iran through the image the government presents in the media,â\\x80\\x9d said Magali Magnim, a    video technician from Lyon, France. She and two friends were in Isfahan, one of Iranâ\\x80\\x99s most historic cities, as part of a   tour. â\\x80\\x9cBut everything is so different from what I expected. â\\x80\\x9d What surprised her was that it felt safe. â\\x80\\x9cHere on the streets, I feel more safe here than in France,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Magnim said. â\\x80\\x9cI feel everybody I meet can be trusted. â\\x80\\x9d For many tourists, a trip to Iran was always more than just a holiday. It was a journey into the unknown, with a frisson of danger added. For decades, news coverage of the country was overwhelmingly negative, led by such topics as the Islamic Revolution in 1979 and the ensuing hostage crisis the death sentence issued against the British writer Salman Rushdie the crackdown on protests in 2009 and accusations that its leaders were trying to build a nuclear weapon. For outsiders, Iran has been a dark and scary place. What was often lost was the other side of Iran: its ancient history, its young and   population, its food and culture. After the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers, which led to the lifting of most sanctions and a reconnection to the world, the sharpest edges seem to have been taken off. Long suspicious of foreigners, Iranian officials  â\\x80\\x94   led by the   President Hassan Rouhani  â\\x80\\x94   are now welcoming them. The number of Western tourists who are visiting is hard to gauge accurately. Officials say more than 5. 2 million tourists visited last year, and more are expected this year. But that counts the millions of Shiite pilgrims who come to the country annually. In comparison, Turkey, the regionâ\\x80\\x99s tourism powerhouse, used to receive around 20 million tourists a year before an increase in terrorist attacks, a dispute with Moscow over a downed fighter plane and a failed coup attempt cut into the total. â\\x80\\x9cIn our travel agency, we catered to a thousand Westerners last year and will have well over 2, 000 Western visitors this year,â\\x80\\x9d said Hossein Ramtin at the Marco Polo Iran Touring Company, one of the largest tour operators in Iran. He noted that many visitors are brought to Iran by foreign tour operators and other companies  â\\x80\\x94   including The New York Times, which offers cultural tours  â\\x80\\x94   and that he expected their numbers to rise. â\\x80\\x9cEspecially French and Spanish tourists are coming in large numbers,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Opening the country to tourists is part of Mr. Rouhaniâ\\x80\\x99s carefully planned outreach to the West, aimed at cementing ties after the nuclear deal. Iranâ\\x80\\x99s culture of hospitality should play a part in that policy, he said during a tourism conference in September, the Iranian news media reported. Iranian visa policies were already quite simple, with Europeans able to obtain one on arrival. After the nuclear deal was reached, the government extended the tourist visa to three months from two weeks. Americans and Britons are treated differently, permitted to travel the country only in guided tours where they can be watched. The policy of opening up to foreign tourists is propelling more visits, said Mr. Ramtin, the tour operator. â\\x80\\x9cWhen they come home, they tell others Iran is safe and secure, and more will come. All in all, our image is slowly being upgraded. â\\x80\\x9d Every breakthrough in tourism is widely celebrated. Last month, when the Dutch carrier KLM became the latest European airline to fly to Iran, Iranian firefighters sprayed arcs of water over one of its aircraft in greeting. Iranian photojournalists covered it as if they were shooting a   event. â\\x80\\x9cKLM returns to Iran,â\\x80\\x9d front pages said the next day. Hotel development, in the deep freeze in the decades of isolation, has kicked in, with three new properties in Tehran since 2015 and more planned. However, overall tourist services are poor in many parts of the country, guides complain. Basically everything in the industry needs improving, said Pegah Ghanaat, a tour guide who works with Spanish visitors. â\\x80\\x9cThe entire tourism infrastructure needs an overhaul,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s as simple as that. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Magnim, the French tourist, and her friends have found a way around the problem of hotel room shortages by using social media as their guide. Through a website called Couchsurfing, they spend their nights in the houses of Iranians who want to meet foreigners. â\\x80\\x9cWhen you stay in peopleâ\\x80\\x99s homes, you get to know the real culture,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Magnim said. â\\x80\\x9cIt turns out many Iranians have the same dreams and ideas we have. â\\x80\\x9d The number of Iranians offering beds and couches to crash on has mushroomed in recent years, to more than 36, 000 from virtually nothing, the Couchsurfing website reports. No money is exchanged, just experiences. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a great way of showing the real Iran to foreigners,â\\x80\\x9d said Reza Memarsadeghi, 43, who studied philosophy in Vancouver, British Columbia, and returned to Iran to take care of his ailing father. Back in Tehran, he heard of Couchsurfing, and now, six years later, he is known as the Godfather of Couchsurfing, having hosted more than 1, 000 foreigners in his parentsâ\\x80\\x99 basement. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve stopped counting, to be honest. â\\x80\\x9d His enthusiasm also showed the limits of how much hospitality Iranâ\\x80\\x99s rulers want their citizens to show. Mixing with foreigners is already suspicious, to Iranâ\\x80\\x99s   at least, but having hundreds sleep over is too much even for those seeking better ties with the West. In August, Mr. Memarsadeghi was arrested and charged with making â\\x80\\x9cpropaganda against the Islamic republicâ\\x80\\x9d for hosting Western men and unveiled Western women who were mingling. â\\x80\\x9cNow my mother wonâ\\x80\\x99t let me have guests staying over,â\\x80\\x9d he said. He was released and is awaiting trial. Still, he wishes that even more foreigners would come to Iran. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all about people meeting people,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThat will change the world. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       " 'The Kentucky county clerk at the center of a national firestorm over her refusal to issue same-sex marriage licenses vowed Monday -- just days after her release from jail -- that she would not prevent her office from issuing such licenses but would not personally authorize them either.\\n\\nKim Davis, the clerk for Rowan County, detailed what she described as a \"remedy\" during a brief press conference as she returned to work for the first time since her jailing.\\n\\nWhether that \"remedy\" satisfies the courts -- or undermines the legal validity of the licenses -- remains to be seen.Â\\xa0Asked if the licenses issued by Davis\\' office without her name would still be valid, a spokeswoman in Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway\\'s office told FoxNews.com that both Conway and the county attorney have \"said publicly that they believe the licenses are legal.\" The spokeswoman added, \"We have not provided an official opinion on this issue.\"\\n\\nUnder Davis\\' new plan, her deputy clerks will be allowed to issue gay marriage licenses if they choose. She said she would not take action against them.\\n\\nBut the licenses \"will not be issued or authorized by me,\" Davis said. \"Any license will not have my name, my title or my authority on it ... instead, it will say it\\'s issued pursuant to a federal court order.\"\\n\\nDavis added that she has \"great doubts whether a license issued under these conditions is valid.\"\\n\\nLast Tuesday, U.S. District Judge David Bunning, ordered Davis released from jail after finding the court was \"satisfied\" that her office\\'s deputy clerks were issuing marriage licenses \"to all legally eligible couples.\"\\n\\nAt the same time, Bunning directed Davis not to \"interfere in any way\" with the marriage licenses being issued by her office. Should she interfere, the judge said, \"that will be considered a violation of this Order and appropriate sanctions will be considered.\"\\n\\nDavis on Monday appealed to the legislature to provide for an accommodation in situations like this.\\n\\n\"My simple request for an accommodation has gone unheard,\" she said. Choking up, she said she\\'s faced with a \"seemingly impossible choice\" of \"my conscience or my freedom.\"\\n\\n\"I do not want to have this conflict. I don\\'t want to be in the spotlight,\" she said.\\n\\nAfterward, one reporter tweeted a picture showing Davis\\' office, with its blinds closed and a sheriff\\'s deputy standing outside.\\n\\nOn Friday, Davis\\' attorneys filed an appeal asking for another delay in issuing the licenses. They argued in their motion to the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals that all the same-sex couples who sued Davis for a license received one from her deputies while she was in jail. Therefore, they said, her office should not be required to issue them to any more couples once she returns to work.\\n\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union initially filed a suit against Davis on behalf of four couples, two straight and two gay, who were denied licenses after the Supreme Court in June effectively legalized gay marriage nationwide. When Davis refused Bunning\\'s order to issue licenses, the judge declared the clerk in contempt of court and jailed her for five days.\\n\\nIn her absence, her deputy clerks issued licenses and both same-sex couples who sued her received one. But Bunning clarified his order to include all eligible couples who request a marriage license.\\n\\nIn the appeal filed Friday, Davis\\' lawyers, with the Christian law firm Liberty Counsel, argued that Bunning issued the clarification improperly and once again asked the appeals court to delay the mandate that she issue licenses.\\n\\nThe appeals court has already dismissed Davis\\' primary argument that her religious faith should exempt her from licensing a gay marriage. \"It cannot be defensibly argued that the holder of the Rowan County Clerk\\'s office, apart from who personally occupies that office, may decline to act in conformity with the United States Constitution as interpreted by a dispositive holding of the United States Supreme Court,\" a panel wrote two weeks ago when it rejected her last appeal.\\n\\nSince Bunning first ordered Davis to issue the marriage licenses, the clerk and her attorneys have made several attempts to legally get around it. One of their strategies was to ask Bunning to stop Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear and Library and Archives Commissioner Wayne Onkst from directing Davis to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Bunning denied that request on Friday.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

Everyone knows  Shakedown Al does nothing to help the hundreds of young black men who are killed by other black youths every year. It s all about the contributions to Al and his worthless  charity At a Hartford, Connecticut rally supposedly called to protest five homicides of young people in the city over the past two weeks   four of them shootings   Rev. Al Sharpton was challenged Saturday by a black pastor for asking every preacher present to donate $100 to Sharpton s civil rights organization, National Action Network (NAN). I want to be here to see a memorial for the young people that have died,  said Sharpton at Shiloh Baptist Church, according to CT News Junkie.  I want the names and their stories up so children can see they don t want to be on that wall. Pastor Marcus Mosiah Jarvis of Christ the Cornerstone Praise and Western Tabernacle, however, shouted at Sharpton as he strode down the center aisle of the crowded church,  How dare you ask the people of Hartford to give you their money! You re nothing but a pimp! Jarvis slammed Sharpton for using the supposed anti-violence rally as a cover for  coming into a community where people are struggling for jobs, struggling for money, and demanding money to speak. Don t you come up in here asking us for money,  Jarvis yelled, according to Fox CT.Jarvis was about to be escorted out of the church, but he instead remained in the rear.

As Breitbart News reported in April of last year, the IRS fined the nonprofit for not properly reporting its taxes, and it was charged with $1.9 million in back taxes and penalties. Additionally, the New York Times reported last November that Sharpton owes more than $4.5 million in state and federal taxes. Mr. Sharpton has regularly sidestepped the sorts of obligations most people see as inevitable, like taxes, rent and other bills,  reported the Times.The rally was the culmination of a march through Hartford in which Sharpton and about 150 mostly black individuals participated.

       " 'Hillary Clinton claimed the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday night after decisive victories in the California, New Jersey and New Mexico primaries, and she quickly appealed to supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to unite with her against Donald J. Trump. The Associated Press reported early Wednesday that Mrs. Clinton had won California, but Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he would yield, insisting earlier that he would continue his campaign and barely acknowledging her achievement. With the   Democratic race nearing a close, Mrs. Clinton savored the biggest night of her extraordinary journey from lawyer, wife and first lady to senator, secretary of state and, now, the first woman to win a major partyâ\\x80\\x99s nomination. At a rally in Brooklyn, she took the stage with her hands clasped over her heart in gratitude, then threw open her arms in joy and savored a long moment as a jubilant crowd waved American flags and chanted â\\x80\\x9cHillary. â\\x80\\x9d Reaching for history, Mrs. Clinton pledged to build on the achievements of pioneers like the   leaders at Seneca Falls, N. Y. who began the fight for womenâ\\x80\\x99s rights in America. â\\x80\\x9cTonight caps an amazing journey  â\\x80\\x94   a long, long journey,â\\x80\\x9d she said, nearly a century after women won the right to vote nationwide. â\\x80\\x9cWe all owe so much to those who came before, and tonight belongs to all of you. â\\x80\\x9d As six states voted on Tuesday, Mr. Sandersâ\\x80\\x99s political lifeline frayed with each loss. He was left hoping for a   victory in the California primary, to justify staying in the race and lobbying Democratic officials to support him in a contested convention next month. In a speech in Santa Monica, Calif. late Tuesday night that felt much like a valedictory, Mr. Sanders told supporters he was determined to stop Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, from winning the presidency. Yet he spoke of their cause as much larger than his candidacy. â\\x80\\x9cYou all know that it is more than Bernie  â\\x80\\x94   it is all of us together,â\\x80\\x9d he said. He vowed to â\\x80\\x9cfight hard to winâ\\x80\\x9d the final primary, in the District of Columbia next week, and to continue â\\x80\\x9cour fight for social, economic, racial and environmental justiceâ\\x80\\x9d at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia. But he also recognized cold political reality. â\\x80\\x9cI am pretty good in arithmetic, and I know that the fight in front of us is a very, very steep fight,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cBut we will continue to fight for every vote and every delegate we can get. â\\x80\\x9d While Mr. Sanders noticeably ignored Mrs. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s triumph, only crediting â\\x80\\x9cher victories tonight,â\\x80\\x9d she lavished praise on him earlier at her Brooklyn rally. She said their â\\x80\\x9cvigorous debateâ\\x80\\x9d had been â\\x80\\x9cvery good for the Democratic Party and America. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Sanders won the North Dakota caucuses and the Montana primary, while Mrs. Clinton won the South Dakota primary. Republicans also voted in several states. Though Mr. Sanders made plans to lay off much of his campaign staff, he appeared reluctant to let go completely after months of political warfare against a Clinton machine that he holds in thinly veiled contempt. President Obama plans to meet with Mr. Sanders at the White House on Thursday at the candidateâ\\x80\\x99s request, an administration spokesman said, adding that Mr. Obama had called both Democratic candidates Tuesday night to congratulate them on â\\x80\\x9crunning inspiring campaigns. â\\x80\\x9d As Mrs. Clinton sought to turn her attention to the general election, Mr. Trump, who had a weekslong head start, was busy reckoning with problems of his own making. His criticism of a federal judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel, for the judgeâ\\x80\\x99s Mexican heritage continued to inflict damage on his campaign, as the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, called Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s remarks racist and other Republicans piled on. One Republican senator rescinded his support. Mr. Trump, speaking in Briarcliff Manor, N. Y. pledged to make Republicans â\\x80\\x9cproud of our party and our movement,â\\x80\\x9d though he did not try to defuse the controversy. Instead, reading carefully from a teleprompter, he mounted a lengthy attack on Mrs. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s record, saying she had â\\x80\\x9cturned the State Department into her private hedge fund. â\\x80\\x9d And he teased a speech, â\\x80\\x9con probably Monday of next week,â\\x80\\x9d that he said would delve into â\\x80\\x9call of the things that have taken place with the Clintons. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump explicitly reached out to Sanders supporters, who he said had been â\\x80\\x9cleft out in the cold by a rigged system. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe canâ\\x80\\x99t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThe Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Clinton returned fire at Mr. Trump in her remarks, charging that he â\\x80\\x9cwants to win by stoking fear and rubbing salt into wounds. â\\x80\\x9d Yet she avoided the sort of slashing attacks and ridicule that she used to great effect in her indictment of Mr. Trump and his temperament last week. Scarcely raising her voice on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton again looked to the example of an influential woman, this time tenderly invoking her mother. â\\x80\\x9cShe told me to never back down from a bully, which it turns out was pretty good advice,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Although Tuesday had promised to be a watershed moment in the nationâ\\x80\\x99s political history, it proved anticlimactic after The A. P. reported Monday night that Mrs. Clinton had secured enough delegates to clinch the partyâ\\x80\\x99s nomination. But she stuck to her plan to use her rally, at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, to celebrate her achievement with some of the same New York Democrats who helped her win a Senate seat in 2000, beginning her career in elected office. The unexpected news on Monday set off conversations within the two campaigns, with Clinton representatives preparing to make overtures to the Sanders camp as early as Wednesday. Sanders advisers were on edge over the declaration that Mrs. Clinton had locked up the nomination, worried that it would depress voter turnout in California. And Mr. Sanders told NBC on Tuesday evening that he was â\\x80\\x9cupsetâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cdisappointedâ\\x80\\x9d that The A. P. had made its call based on a survey of superdelegates, party officials who can shift their allegiances as late as the convention. Mr. Sanders said that his aides were â\\x80\\x9con the phone right nowâ\\x80\\x9d with superdelegates, including those supporting Mrs. Clinton. â\\x80\\x9cDefying history is what this campaign has been about,â\\x80\\x9d he said of his bid, which was initially seen as a long shot. â\\x80\\x9cI am going to be meeting with our supporters to figure out the best way forward so that we have a government which represents all of us, and not just the 1 percent. â\\x80\\x9d His campaign also emailed supporters late Tuesday asking them to commit to vote for him in the final Democratic primary, in the District of Columbia next Tuesday, suggesting that Mr. Sanders was not calling it quits just yet. Still, he planned to let go a large number of workers on Wednesday, according to current and former aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Part of Mr. Sandersâ\\x80\\x99s challenge is that his justifications for continuing his campaign are increasingly thin. Mrs. Clinton has now won a majority of the 4, 051 pledged delegates at stake in the Democratic primaries and caucuses, crossing what Mr. Sanders had long held up as a critical threshold. She also has support from 571 superdelegates to Mr. Sandersâ\\x80\\x99s 48 only about 100 uncommitted superdelegates remain. The campaign managers for Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have been speaking recently, including early on Tuesday, about the future of the race and about policy priorities for the partyâ\\x80\\x99s convention platform in July, according to two Democrats close to the candidates. So far, the discussions have not included the possibility that Mr. Sanders will concede to Mrs. Clinton or endorse her, the Democrats said, but the groundwork has been laid for an eventual conversation or meeting. Several advisers to Mr. Sanders said Tuesday that he had not been inviting opinions or holding meetings about whether to withdraw from the race, nor had he sketched out a speech announcing the suspension of his campaign. They said he had been wholly focused on winning the California primary in hopes that a victory in such a politically important state would help him lobby superdelegates to shift their support. â\\x80\\x9cMoving a lot of superdelegates into our column will require a big campaign of persuasion, a nationwide logistical effort, but we believe we have a strong case to make to them  â\\x80\\x94   especially if we do very well in Tuesdayâ\\x80\\x99s primaries,â\\x80\\x9d said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders. Other campaign advisers said they expected Mr. Sanders to consider his options during his flight from California to Vermont on Wednesday. One recalled that Mrs. Clinton did much the same when she found herself in a similar situation eight years ago. The day after Barack Obama clinched the Democratic nomination in June 2008, Mrs. Clinton huddled with her advisers and debated whether to hold on to her delegates and try to force a contested convention. She decided to endorse Mr. Obama instead. The two had a tense but productive meeting that Thursday night, and two days later she delivered a speech thanking her supporters and urging them to unite around the partyâ\\x80\\x99s presumptive nominee. The resistance of many of Mr. Sandersâ\\x80\\x99s supporters to Mrs. Clinton is likely to soften once Mr. Sanders leaves the race, and especially if he endorses her. But Clinton advisers and allies say they will need his help to bring around the many younger voters and liberals who prefer him. If Mrs. Clinton is beginning the general election with many Sanders supporters incensed at her, Mr. Trump is in the midst of his own   crisis. He is forcing Republicans to confront a painful choice: Embrace his brand of racial politics, one that could taint the partyâ\\x80\\x99s image well beyond this election, or abandon their presumptive nominee and hand the White House to the Democrats for another four years. But Mrs. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s supporters, pointing both to the threat from Mr. Trump and to her chance at making history, predicted that she would have an easier time bringing her party together than Mr. Trump would his. â\\x80\\x9cI think that will sink in over the next few weeks and months and will go a long way to helping unite the party,â\\x80\\x9d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said. â\\x80\\x9cI was on the bike this morning and saw on TV that Monday night, Hillary had won the nomination, and I got  . From a   perspective, itâ\\x80\\x99s an amazing accomplishment. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

During the Presidential campaign, Rubio was humiliated by Trump who dubbed him  Little Marco.  Soon after, the slighted Senator was forced to drop out of the race due to a lack of support for his campaign.SEE ALSO: Retired US General Picks Apart Sen. Cotton s  Scarlet Letter  to IranOn its face, Trump and the Israel First hawks  policy to crush the JCPOA Nuclear Agreement makes little sense. Business Insider explains:John Glaser and Emma Ashford respond to Trump s latest attack on the nuclear deal: Iran is clearly abiding by the deal s requirements, as President Trump himself has twice formally acknowledged. But the President appears determined to ignore U.S. allies, his own intelligence community and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has affirmed eight separate times in detailed reports that Iran is in compliance with the deal.As is usually the case, the US hawks (also supported by Iran s economic and geopolitical regional rival Saudi Arabia) are hoping to trigger retaliatory rhetoric from the Iranian hawks   and use those words to justify a call for escalation of tension, and a full range of new sanctions against Iran:This desire to withdraw from the JCPOA is difficult to explain. Whatever Trump s reasoning, this much is clear: All of America s options outside the JCPOA carry unacceptably high risks and threaten to exacerbate the very behavior Iran hawks hope to forestall.Desperate to fabricate their case against Iran, the US (instructed by the Israeli Lobby) are now trying to brand Iran s military as an international  terrorist  organisation.RT International reports Iran has vowed a  firm and crushing  reaction should Washington decide to include the elite wing of its army, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), on its list of terrorist organizations, according to the country s foreign ministry.The comments came from Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi on Monday as cited by Tasnim news agency. We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,  Qasemi stated during a news conference. If they do, Iran s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing,  he said, adding that the US would have to accept the consequences.Earlier it was reported that Washington is preparing tougher sanctions on Tehran, including the possible designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist group.US President Donald Trump has taken a tough stance on the Islamic Republic, criticizing it for supporting terrorism and vowing to  put an end to Iran s continued aggression and nuclear ambitions. On Sunday, IRGC chief Mohammad Ali Jafari warned that if the reports are confirmed, the military wing will treat US troops, especially in the Middle East, as they would Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists. If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American Army to be like Islamic State all around the world, particularly in the Middle East,  Jafari stated.Washington s reported threats have prompted France to speak against actions that  could exacerbate the current crises  in the face of  regional instability.   With this in mind, regional states have a specific role to play and must show restraint and a sense of responsibility,  French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne stressed, when asked whether Paris would endorse such a step.The landmark Iranian nuclear agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was signed by the P5+1 group (China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK, and the US) and the European Union in 2015. According to the deal, Iran is to limit its nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for easing the pre-existing sanctions.READ MORE: World will change : Trump likely to pull out of Iran nuclear deal next week   German FMDuring his election campaign Trump repeatedly vowed to scrap the agreement, and during his presidency he has continued to accuse Iran of violating the  spirit  of the deal.

       " 'Only Hillary would go to Flint, MI to use the water crisis in a city run by Democrats to prop up her campaign. Americans should have known that with the extensive list of scandals in Hillary s past, there had to be a water pollution scandal. Well, as it turns out there is and it s a whopper!  Hillary Clinton has turned the drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, into a central issue for her campaign and will look to capitalize on that focus when she faces Bernie Sanders at Saturday s Democratic debate in the troubled city, but in the 1992 Democratic primary, it was Bill Clinton who was on defense for standing by as Arkansas  water was polluted.Former senator Tom Harkin (D., Iowa) went after Clinton during a candidate forum that year for putting himself forward as an environmentalist even though Arkansas was an environmental disaster during his tenure as governor. Mr. Clinton, that was a very nice, flowery little speech, but we have to start reading the records and not the lips,  said Harkin, who went on to point out that Arkansas was rated last in environmental policy during his governorship.Here s video of the interaction:Harkin also said that Clinton s Environmental Protection Agency was  a joke  and that it was  loaded with representatives of the biggest polluter in Arkansas. That polluter was Tyson Foods, a powerful political backer of Clinton that contaminated the drinking water supply of more than 300,000 people with roughly 500,000 tons of chicken waste that was dumped into streams. The presence of  fecal bacteria  in the water caused entire towns near Tyson plants to be plagued by chronic dysentery and salmonella.In one case, it took Clinton 17 months after being notified by health inspectors that a Tyson plant was leaking 1 million gallons of sewage into a town s water supply to take any action.This turned into a major issue in the 1992 campaign, and not just for Clinton s opponents.After Clinton won his party s nomination, CNN sent a reporter to Arkansas to examine just how bad the environmental situation was.Here s video of the lengthy report:The report found that state agencies were aware that 3,700 miles of Arkansas waterways were at risk of being destroyed by  agricultural source pollution  and that it took Clinton until 1990 to create a task force to address the problem.One scientist who focused on the quality of Arkansas water expressed his belief to CNN that the only reason Clinton formed the task force was because of his presidential aspirations. I think there is a direct connection between the current emphasis on animal waste and runoff and his bid for the presidency,  said hydrologist Skip Halterman.Clinton is also criticized by CNN for giving a third of the seats on the task force to members of the poultry industry that was a major source of political contributions for Clinton.

       " ' Dick Eastman The Truth HoundWhen Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller met with Zhou Enlai in China in 1973 just after President Richard Nixon had visited China establishing official relations an understanding was reached whereby the U.S. would supply industrial capital and know-how to China.In return Kissinger-connected corporations would gain the monopolistic advantage of low-cost labor production which could outcompete all U.S. domestic industry.The comparative advantage gained was being able to hire Chinese laborers who were ready to work hard at exceedingly low cost with no drugs, no alcohol, a strong work ethic, no unions, no paid benefits and weak environmental standards. And with such a large labor pool, burned out workers could simply be replaced. This gave the Rockefeller/Kissinger corporations a major edge over their domestic U.S. competitors who had to pay relatively high wages, high regulation costs, deal with union strikes and collective bargaining etc.Of course, the American consumer did not see greatly lowered prices commensurate with such greatly lowered labor costs. The $19.99 plastic action-figure toy marketed with a Hollywood movie still cost $19.99 even though it cost $12 to $15 to produce in the U.S. but less than $2.00 per copy to produce in China and transport to America s West Coast container ports for distribution throughout America.The consumer paid pretty much the old prices but the corporations split the monopoly profit with China s Princelings since it did not take much of a lowering of prices to drive high-wage, high-benefit, contracted-labor domestic corporations out of business (not to mention the environmental and workplace safety regulations with which domestic companies were saddled).  Then, Wal-Mart became a near-monopoly retailer that increased and reinforced the widespread selling of these off-shore manufactures.Thus, America s domestic producers were not simply being bested on one or another area of production; they were being bested across the entire spectrum of manufactured goods that American buy. It was anticipated that these domestic firms would fail, and their failure was hastened by the banks maintaining a deflationary domestic economy in the U.S. throughout the post Rockefeller-Kissinger-Zhou buildup of China and the degrading of American domestic manufacturing.Remember, the entire money supply of the U.S. is borrowed that is, the money co-created with a debt of an even bigger amount (principal plus compound interest) that must in due course be returned to the lender. But money in the domestic economy was going to multinational corporations and to China, while also going to taxes to pay on the national debt that resulted [NOTE: Due to U.S. industrial depletion, federal revenue receipts as well as the tax-take of state and local governments, shrunk, resulting in greater government borrowing and therefore greater public debts TRUTH HOUND note].  And of course, compound interest was attached to that debt.Rockefeller and Kissinger were (and to some extent still are) at war with middle-class America with intelligent, self-supporting, self-respecting, ambitious, industrious citizens who always pose the greatest threat in the form of populist politics to the bankers and their Bank-of-England/East-India-Company/Rothschild monetary and trade system, the very system that Rockefeller and Kissinger were representing and expanding when they visited Zhou Enlai.So here we are in 2016 and newly elected President Donald J. Trump says he intends to place a tariff on goods imported from China, while the media decries the tariff proposal as a violation of  long-standing liberal free-trade policies. One more thing in defense of who I believe was a great president and a warning for the new one.Richard Nixon opened China believing in peaceful co-existence and the fact that if given time for a fair comparison of how free-enterprise and representative government functions in contrast to the communist planned economy, that the U.S. model would win out over a system where each receives what the state deems he needs and where work is ordered by the state.But of course Kissinger and Rockefeller instigated the Watergate coup against Nixon a frame-up with John Dean and Kissinger as the real  Deep Throats  by my deductions from public information so that the Rockefeller/Kissinger plans for China s industrialization and America s deindustrialization could proceed unopposed, as it certainly did after Nixon resigned to avoid a constitutional crisis that would hinder the proper working of government.Nixon should have fought them because they were about to take a financial axe to this country as soon as Nixon was gone.  When Nixon was gone, they first robbed the middle-class of their savings with banker Paul Volcker s  QE  (quantitative easing) bond purchases at the New York Federal Reserve branch. Then, when that was accomplished, America s savings-and-loans were cast into crisis (because they had been taking in money short-term at 3% and lending long-term at 6%). This helped force the deregulation of banking to Rockefeller advantage after which Volcker moved to become Federal Reserve Chairman in control of the discount rate. With that lever of power that sets the interest-rate framework of the nation, Volcker inaugurated the tight-money (deflation) policy that has persisted to this day, making it very hard for firms to invest in automation to combat the cost advantage of Chinese subsistence labor.Japan was hit with deflation too   they were going to provide us with the robots.  THE WHOLE THING WAS A GREAT PLAN AGAINST US, COORDINATED AT EVERY LEVEL, WITH EVERY INSTITUTION, FROM THE NEWS TALKING ABOUT HOW THE LEVERAGED BUY-OUTS OCCURING IN THE DEFLATION WERE MAKING US  LEAN AND MEAN,  WHEN IN FACT THEY WERE TEARING OUT THE GUTS OF AMERICAN PRODUCTION.  And the news media and the economics and business administration courses in colleges sung the praises of international free trade and the  efficiency of markets  nonstop.I watched it all from a pretty good seat on the sidelines, but of course I was marginalized as just another excess white person who needed to stand aside so that blacks and women could have their fair chance.  And who could argue with that?  So I took to the internet to see what effect I could have simply speaking as a citizen, where I ve met encountered considerable abuse and ridicule, which certainly makes it unpleasant to try and be the  Paul Revere  awakening the good citizens.I do wish President Donald Trump the best. But let us make sure that none of the neo-conservatives he is taking into his administration are really  Kissingers  beholden to Goldman-Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.

       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - A project looking at links between mental health and terrorism in three English cities has been expanded nationwide after it found a significant number of people referred to counter-radicalization programs suffer some form of mental illness. Studies have suggested the prevalence of mental health issues among militants working together on major strikes is very low but a string of killings by so-called lone wolves has fueled concerns mental illness could be a factor behind some attacks. Authorities say some of those involved in four attacks in Britain this year blamed on Islamist militants appeared to people who had self-radicalized via the internet and whose mental state had been questioned. To look more closely at the issue, British police launched pilot programs in April last year in England s three biggest urban areas - London, Birmingham and Manchester - to embed mental health experts with counter-terrorism officers. The aim was to give psychiatrists the chance to identify people referred to Britain s counter-radicalization program Prevent who had mental health issues, and treat them.  Anecdotally, I am surprised that there appears to be a much higher prevalence of people with mental health problems than you would expect,  said Professor Jennifer Shaw, the mental health lead for Greater Manchester Police, referring to the people her team had dealt with since the pilot was launched. The hubs are considered so successful by the government they have been expanded nationwide, Shaw, professor of forensic psychiatry at the University of Manchester, told Reuters. But such is the secrecy around the work of Prevent and Channel - a de-radicalization program within the overall project - there are few details about its successes or failings and Shaw s work has not previously been discussed in the media. Some psychiatrists argue that no scientific link between mental health issues and terrorist attacks has yet been established and they worry the programs risk stigmatizing people suffering from mental illnesses. Another psychiatrist gathering data under the pilot programs told Reuters that Britain s Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism had told them not to disclose any details of their findings ahead of a final report. Those findings are expected to be among a raft of data about people referred to Prevent due to be released this week. Britain s interior ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Dr Adrian James, registrar at Britain s Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP), said the link between mental health problems and terrorist acts had not been established.  He said a lack of evidence, partly because militant attacks were so rare, was at the heart of the problem, adding that an unnecessary level of secrecy about Prevent also meant many psychiatrists viewed the program with suspicion.  If it is true that there is a link, we need to know and then need to look at the causes of that and what we can do about them,  James told Reuters.  We just want the facts.  Past studies have disagreed about the significance of mental health issues among lone wolf attackers, with some academics concluding that such illnesses are blamed to try to explain often complex reasons for attacks. British police decided to launch the pilot programs because they believed that roughly half the 7,500 people referred to Prevent each year had a broad range of mental health and psychological difficulties. Those working on the pilot projects hope the information being gathered will now help experts assess any possible links between mental health issues and attacks. Shaw said determining who might be a potential attacker from mental health problems alone was not really feasible and fraught with problems, but she said it might be possible to ascertain the characteristics of people most likely to be at risk and ensure they got appropriate help.  That doesn t mean you can t manage the risks. Trying to nip it in the bud, that s all you can do. But that s good if you can achieve that, it s going a long way,  said Shaw. Police officers say they have struggled in the past to reach medical practitioners when they had concerns about some people and Shaw said the pilot was designed to address those worries. According to one of Shaw s case studies, a man went to a hospital saying he monitored Islamic State websites, had been walking around the city center working out how many people he could kill in a gun attack, and wanted to behead his mother. Shaw s team discovered the man had no contact with mental health services and no diagnosis of any illness. An urgent assessment concluded his anger stemmed from experiences in his childhood and safeguarding measures were put in place.  British police have no doubts about the importance of the work, especially given the global shift from carefully planned spectacular attacks by militant networks to unsophisticated, strikes by individuals using cars and knives as weapons. Mark Rowley, Britain s most senior counter-terrorism officer, told the British Medical Journal in April that a disproportionate number of suspects in 13 attacks foiled by British police since 2013 had mental health issues.  If part of the terrorist methodology is to prey on the vulnerable ... then it stands to reason that there will be people with certain mental health conditions who will be ... susceptible to that,  he said.  Radicalizing and inciting someone who is vulnerable to go and carry out some ghastly attack seems to be part of their tactics, and that has brought in a whole load of vulnerability issues, including mental health, that we now have to wrestle with,  said Rowley. A study by University College London s (UCL) Department of Security and Crime Science looked at 55 attacks involving 76 individuals between May 2014 and September 2016 where reports had shown the perpetrators may have been influenced by IS. The study found 34 percent of those involved in attacks inspired by Islamic State - rather than actually directed by the militant group - had mental health issues. Health experts estimate about one in four people will suffer some form of mental health issue and those with mental illnesses are generally less likely to commit violent crimes than the overall population. Shaw said those with mental health issues and developmental disorders referred to her team at Prevent were more likely to be suffering from psychosis and autism, adding that people with serious mental illnesses often had tiny social networks.  They can therefore, when unwell, be influenced by messages that go out that say come and belong to our group. It can be quite compelling. The same for people with autism. The internet kind of way of getting the message out makes those people, particularly vulnerable. So I think that s a big issue.  Psychiatrists worry that all people with mental health issues could be stigmatized and considered potential militants, possibly deterring them from seeking help. Prevent, one of the four strands of Britain s counter-terrorism strategy known as Contest launched in 2003, has also been dogged by claims it is used to spy on Muslim communities. A government edict in 2015 instructing public bodies such as schools, health workers and universities to raise any concerns they have about individuals with the authorities has exacerbated those concerns. Shaw acknowledged more work was needed on the outcomes of their mental health interventions under the Prevent pilot programs to determine what made a difference. Asked if people her team had treated might have committed violent acts if their conditions had not been addressed, she said:  That is the obvious question. You can t say that in any kind of scientific way.  We re attempting to try and get at that. Is it completely to do with their mental illness, half to do with it, or not at all?  said Shaw.  We have had cases where people have had ideologies, they have also had a mental health problem, and they are not linked at all. The last thing we need is  all these bombers are nutters . We don t want that going on.  ',\n",

       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s Hezbollah accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s government on Sunday of pushing the region to war in Syria, Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, and said nowhere in Israel would be safe if such a conflict were to erupt. Tensions have risen this year between Iran-backed Hezbollah and its arch enemy Israel, which last fought a major conflict in 2006. Israel has said it would use all its strength from the start in any new war with Hezbollah. In a speech to followers, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the Israeli government did not have  a correct assessment of where this war will lead if they ignite it , and did not know how it would end.  They do not have a correct picture about what is awaiting them if they go to the idiocy of this war,  Nasrallah said. Israel does not know where such a conflict would be fought, or who would take part, he added. Nasrallah said earlier this year that a future Israeli war against Syria or Lebanon could draw thousands of fighters from countries such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and Pakistan, and could take place inside Israel. Israel is concerned by Tehran s steadily increasing influence in the region during the six-year-old Syrian conflict, whether via its own Revolutionary Guard forces or the groups it backs, especially Hezbollah. Nasrallah was speaking on Sunday on the occasion of Ashura, when Shi ites commemorate the slaying of the Prophet Mohammad s grandson, the Imam Hussein, at Kerbala in 680.  He called on Jews who emigrated to Israel to  leave and return to the countries from which they came so they are not fuel for any war that the idiotic Netanyahu government takes them to . Were war to erupt, he said, they might not have long to leave.  They will have no secure place in occupied Palestine,  he said. Netanyahu said in August that Iran was building sites to produce precision-guided missiles in Syria and Lebanon, with the aim of using them against Israel. Tens of thousands of Shi ites wearing mourning black marched through the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs of Beirut to commemorate Ashura, when Hezbollah rallies supporters around its political causes. Men with boxes of tissues weaved through the crowds, handing them to those weeping in mourning.  All of these crowds are answering Nasrallah s call, Hussein s call, saying we are ready to give our selves and souls and blood and children and all we own in sacrifice to this religion,  said Deeb Hussein al-Annan, whose son was killed fighting for Hezbollah in Syria in 2014.  We are defending the cause and our existence [in Syria],  he added, holding a flag emblazoned with a picture of his son. The group s role in Syria is the focus of controversy in Lebanon. Hezbollah s opponents say it has dragged Lebanon into the conflict. Hezbollah says it has stopped extremist groups such as Islamic State from advancing into Lebanon from Syria. Nasrallah said the battle against Islamic State must continue  in every place to eliminate Daesh , using an Arabic acronym for the group. ',\n",

He cites the billionaireâ\\x80\\x99s recent interviews on policy positions in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other media.

But perhaps more important to voters, they have revealed â\\x80\\x9chow totally out of his depth he isâ\\x80\\x9d on almost every major issue, Mackowiak says.\\n\\nSo, can Trump study up and act â\\x80\\x9cmore presidential,â\\x80\\x9d as he says his friends and family are urging him to do?\\n\\nHeâ\\x80\\x99s planning soon to roll out more policy speeches (his speech on US-Israeli relationsÂ\\xa0was written by his son-in-law).

Nicole Andrews (@babycatcher16) July 12, 2017The Twitter debate erupted and raged on in the aftermath of Donald Trump Jr. releasing emails in which he accepted an offer to meet with a Russian lawyer who claimed to have damning information on Hillary Clinton, his father s opponent in the presidential race, as well as being told the Russian government backed Trump Sr s presidential candidacy.It is still unknown whether the President s son released all of the email contact he had with Russia, later published in the New York Times, but it definitely contradicts the months of denial of any dealings with the Russian government that has been coming out of the Trump camp   a story they ve described as a  witch hunt. Barack Obama recently criticized the  absence of American leadership  shown under the Trump administration in a speech he delivered in Berlin in June. While current Gallup polls show that the majority of Americans agree with him, there are still many that are critical of Obama s eight years in office.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\",\n",
       " 'BERLIN (Reuters) - Austria s new Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, called for an end to  failed  attempts to achieve a quota system for distributing asylum seekers around the European Union and urged new efforts to help refugees in their country of origin. When he was foreign minister, Kurz, a conservative now governing in coalition with the far-right Freedom Party, was a strong critic of Chancellor Angela Merkel s decision to open Germany s borders to more than a million fleeing migrants in 2015. Since becoming Chancellor this week, he has aligned himself with central European neighbors like Hungary and the Czech Republic in opposing German-backed proposals to distribute asylum seekers around EU member states.  Forcing states to take refugees doesn t take Europe any further. The discussion makes no sense,  he told Germany s Bild am Sonntag newspaper.  Migrants who set off for Europe don t want to go to Bulgaria or Hungary. They want to go to Germany, Austria or Sweden.  Instead of doubling down on what he termed a  failed  policy, Kurz called for the EU to support,  perhaps militarily , efforts to help migrants in their countries of origin or in neighboring states.  If that isn t possible, then they should be helped in safe areas on their own continent,  he said.  The EU should support that, perhaps even organize it, and back it militarily.  It was not clear from the interview extracts, published by the newspaper, what kind of military support he envisaged. But European leaders have on occasion suggested the EU contribute to peacekeeping operations to stabilize conflicts in Africa. The question of how to deal with streams of migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa also divides Merkel s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) as they prepare for talks on forming a new government. Hard-line members of Merkel s conservative camp demand tight absolute caps on the numbers of refugees allowed to enter Germany each year, while a senior SPD official on Saturday suggested local authorities around Europe be paid to house refugees.

       " 'ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Unidentified kidnappers bundled the deputy governor of Afghanistan s northwestern province of Kunar into a car in the Pakistani city of Peshawar and took him away, police sources said on Sunday. Mohammad Nabi Ahmadi had crossed over from Afghanistan into Pakistan with his brother and was walking down a road in the northwestern city of Peshawar when a car with tinted windows pulled up and overpowered the Afghan official, according to a Peshawar police source. The police source said Ahmadi s brother recounted the episode to Pakistani police, but did not disclose that his brother was a high-ranking Afghan provincial government official.  It was afterwards we came to know from other sources that he was deputy governor of Kunar,  said the police official. Abdul Ghani Musamem, the spokesman for the governor of Kunar, confirmed Ahmadi had gone missing in Peshawar on Friday and added that he had been on leave for medical treatment. Wealthy Afghans frequently cross the border for medical treatment in Pakistan. Many Afghans live in Peshawar and it is also common for influential figures in Afghanistan to have business or family links in the Pashtun regions of Pakistan.  The Pakistani police source said the Afghan government had not told them about Ahmadi s visit, adding that  otherwise we would have provided him with security .  Another security official said police in Peshawar were working to find out if Ahmadi s kidnapping was related to his work or a personal dispute. The Afghan Taliban denied involvement in Ahmadi s kidnapping.  We heard that a deputy Afghan governor went missing in Pakistan but let me clarify that we don t operate outside Afghanistan,  said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.  In Pakistan, our leadership has strictly forbidden our people from any sort of activities as this is not our policy.   ',\n",
       " 'CHICAGO (Reuters) - A bill to send $700 million to cash-starved social services providers breezed through the Illinois Legislature on Thursday, as the state once again turned to stopgap funding measures in lieu of a budget. The measure passed the House 111-0 and the Senate 56-0. There was no immediate comment from Governor Bruce Raunerâ\\x80\\x99s office on whether he will sign it into law. A memo from his budget office expressed concerns that language in the bill could actually prevent funding for some programs. Democratic State Representative Greg Harris said the money would be taken from state funds outside of Illinoisâ\\x80\\x99 general revenue fund to cover 46 percent of what the state has failed to pay service providers due to the ongoing impasse over the fiscal 2016 budget. â\\x80\\x9cThis is a $700 million piece of legislation that would help the neediest at the time they need help the most,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Despite the stalemate between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature, about 90 percent of Illinois government is being funded through continuing appropriations, the enactment of a K-12 school bill, and court-ordered spending. But some parts of the government were left out in the cold. Earlier this month, dozens of unpaid social service providers sued Illinois, seeking more than $100 million. Andrea Durbin, chairman of the Pay Now Illinois coalition that filed the lawsuit, said that if enacted, the bill would not end the litigation. â\\x80\\x9cIt could provide a downpayment of the money we are owed, but itâ\\x80\\x99s not a comprehensive solution for the Pay Now Illinois plaintiffs,â\\x80\\x9d she said. In April, the legislature passed and Rauner signed a $600 million stopgap funding bill for state universities, community colleges, and student tuition grants that covered only 34 percent of the $1.7 billion that had been earmarked for higher education spending in the fiscal year that began on July 1. Illinois is the only U.S. state without a complete fiscal 2016 budget. Rauner earlier on Thursday acknowledged that some lawmakers are working on a budget framework. That framework involves higher taxes, spending cuts, and borrowing, according to local media reports.  â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m cheering for bipartisan General Assembly members to come up with some solutions,â\\x80\\x9d the governor told reporters.

Carter was to be given the award for his work in promoting human rights during Argentina s last military dictatorship.According to CNN, an Argentinean official spoke on condition of anonymity and said the decision not to carry out the official delivery to Jimmy Carter was  to avoid conflicts  and to talk about matters of mutual interest between the two countries.CNN reports:The council that studies who to grant the distinction in the Chancellery of Argentina had approved the distinction to the former president for his work for peace and for his contribution to human rights during the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla when Carter was president of the United States.Trump has never been kind to his critics.

       " 'In big news coming out of the Supreme Court, it was the opinion of the Court that a decision made by an Alabama court refusing to recognize a same-sex adoption will be overturned.When one half of an Alabama couple sought to have the adoption of her children be recognized in her state of Alabama, she was denied, even though the couple together had previously been granted approval by the state of Georgia. The couple has since split up, but both individuals are still parents to their children, as it would be with any heterosexual couple. However, the entire thing does start to get very confusing.Here s the run down via NPR: The two women in the case were together for 16 years, and they had three children conceived by assisted reproductive technology   an older daughter, now 13, and boy and girl twins, now 11. The actual names of the parents have not been revealed. They are identified in court documents by the initials V.L. and E.L.E.L. was the biological mother and V.L. subsequently adopted the children with her partner s explicit consent. The adoption was in Georgia, where both women appeared at a court hearing, and the final adoption decree recognized both as the children s legal parents.When the parents, now living in Alabama, split five years ago, however, the biological mother denied her former partner access to the children. The Alabama courts initially ordered a decree of shared custody, based on the Georgia adoption, but the Alabama Supreme Court overturned the lower court orders. The state Supreme Court said the Georgia courts had wrongly agreed to the adoption.The adoptive mother appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and on Monday the justices unanimously overruled the Alabama Supreme Court in a short, unsigned opinion. Now, all of that aside, let s just get it out there that this was a frickin terrible thing to do, and as a lesbian myself, to see a woman use anti-gay laws against her former partner as a means to try to keep her away from her own children is pretty much the lowest of the low. But I digress Thankfully, the Court sided with the mother who had adoptive rights in Georgia with the argument was brought up where according to the Constitution in Article IV, Section 1, where the Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.  Basically, what s good for the goose, better damn well be good for the gander, and all states need to respect legal acts and proceedings from other states.  According to Cathy Sakimura of the National Center for Lesbian Rights: The Supreme Court s reversal of Alabama s unprecedented decision to void an adoption from another state is a victory not only for our client but for thousands of adopted families. No adoptive parent or child should have to face the uncertainty and loss of being separated years after their adoption just because another state s court disagrees with the law that was applied in their adoption. This decision could affect up to 30 different states, according to a brief that was  submitted by adoption and child welfare agencies. If we re going to have marriage equality, then that equality needs to reach across all levels of the law. This should include, but not be limited to, adoption, and worker s rights as well. No one should be fired for being gay, which currently is still allowed in 28 states. It s 2016, people, gay rights are human rights. There should be no difference whatsoever.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons',\n",
       " 'Anthony Weiner, the husband of Hillary Clinton s closest aide Huma Abedin, has checked into a rehab facility for treatment of sex addition.Out-of-control Weiner, who has been sending sexually-charged messages and obscene pictures to women and at least one teenage girl for years, is now in a treatment facility, DailyMail.com has learned exclusively.Friday s dramatic disclosure by the FBI that it had discovered new emails relevant to their investigation into Hillary Clinton s secret server was a shock unprecedented in electoral history. At the center of it, however, is the tragedy of Anthony Weiner s sex addiction. The rehab center where Weiner is being treated separates men and women and its program includes counseling for those addicted to cybersex and exhibitionism as well as addictions to anonymous sex and porn.WEINER WAS A REPEAT OFFENDER BUT HIS LAST CASE WAS WITH A MINOR A 15-YEAR OLD!In the online messages, Weiner, 51, sent bare-chested photos of himself to the underage girl, repeatedly called her  baby  and complimented her body, and told her that he woke up  hard  after thinking about her, according to copies of the conversations. In one particularly lewd message, he told the teen:  I would bust that tight p***y so hard and so often that you would leak and limp for a week.  When confronted with the claims, Weiner did not deny exchanging  flirtatious  messages with the teen. He declined to comment on the specifics of the allegations on the record, but provided copies of two emails the girl sent him that he contends raised questions about her claims.ANTHONY WEINER gave a statement to DailyMail.com:He says, in part:  I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt. I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. The revelation comes just weeks after Weiner s wife Huma Abedin announced that they had separated in the wake of another sexting controversy. In August, the New York Post reported on sexual chats between Weiner and a 40-year-old woman, during which the former congressman sent her provocative shirtless photos of him while his four-year-old son was curled up next to him in bed. Weiner has faced a number of sexting scandals since 2011, when he was forced to resign from Congress after his online sexual messages with a female college student were revealed. Another sexting scandal in 2013, involving 22-year-old Sydney Leathers, derailed his bid for New York City mayor. In the course of that scandal, his alias Carlos Danger was disclosed.Read more: Daily Mail',\n",
       " 'ISIOLO, Kenya (Reuters) - An expelled student shot dead six of his former schoolmates and a security guard at his school in northern Kenya on Saturday, and was then himself lynched by a furious mob, officials said. The attack took place at a school in the remote town of Lokichogio in Kenya s Turkana region, close to the border with war-torn South Sudan. At least six other students were flown to hospital with bullet wounds. The assailant was a 17-year-old from South Sudan - one of thousands of refugee children who have been living in Kenya and going to school there since civil war broke out in their country in 2013. He was detained in possession of an AK-47, the basic assault rifle of choice in conflicts across Africa and the Middle East.   The school was not attacked by bandits but an errant student on expulsion for disciplinary cases,  regional government official Wanyama Musyambohe told reporters. Security officials said the assailant, whose name has not been disclosed, had been arrested, but then killed by a mob while in police custody.  The attack ... is a painful reminder of the state of insecurity along the border,  tweeted Turkana county governor Josphat Nanok. Close to 2 million people have fled South Sudan since fighting broke out in December 2013, sparking what has become Africa s largest cross-border exodus since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Some 75,000 of them are now in Kenya. Perennial conflicts have left the region awash with arms, which are smuggled across borders with relative ease. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON  â\\x80\\x94   Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew on Wednesday announced the most sweeping and historically symbolic makeover of American currency in a century, proposing to replace the slaveholding Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill with Harriet Tubman, the former slave and abolitionist, and to add women and civil rights leaders to the $5 and $10 notes. Mr. Lew may have reneged on a commitment he made last year to make a woman the face of the $10 bill, opting instead to keep Alexander Hamilton, to the delight of a fan base swollen with enthusiasm over a Broadway rap musical based on the life of the first Treasury secretary. But the broader remaking of the nationâ\\x80\\x99s paper currency, which President Obama welcomed on Wednesday, may well have captured a historical moment for a multicultural, multiethnic and multiracial nation moving contentiously through the early years of a new century. Tubman, an   and a Union spy during the Civil War, would bump Jackson  â\\x80\\x94   a white man known as much for his persecution of Native Americans as for his war heroics and advocacy for the common man  â\\x80\\x94   to the back of the $20, in some reduced image along with the White House. Tubman would be the first woman so honored on paper currency since Martha Washingtonâ\\x80\\x99s portrait briefly graced the $1 silver certificate in the late 19th century. While Hamilton would remain on the $10, and Abraham Lincoln on the $5, images of women would be added to the back of both  â\\x80\\x94   in keeping with Mr. Lewâ\\x80\\x99s intent â\\x80\\x9cto bring to lifeâ\\x80\\x9d the national monuments depicted there. The picture of the Treasury building on the back of the $10 bill would be replaced with a depiction of a 1913 march in support of womenâ\\x80\\x99s right to vote that ended at the building, along with portraits of five suffrage leaders: Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Alice Paul and Susan B. Anthony, who in more recent years was on an unpopular $1 coin until minting ceased. On the flip side of the $5 bill, the Lincoln Memorial would remain, but as the backdrop for the 1939 performance there of Marian Anderson, the   classical singer, after she was barred from singing at the segregated Constitution Hall nearby. Sharing space on the rear would be images of Eleanor Roosevelt, who arranged Andersonâ\\x80\\x99s Lincoln Memorial performance, and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who in 1963 delivered his â\\x80\\x9cI have a dreamâ\\x80\\x9d speech from its steps. The final redesigns will be unveiled in 2020, the centennial of the 19th Amendment establishing womenâ\\x80\\x99s suffrage, and will not go into wide circulation until later in the decade, starting with the new $10 note. The unexpectedly ambitious proposals reflect Mr. Lewâ\\x80\\x99s tortuous attempt to expedite the process and win over critics who have lodged conflicting demands, pitting mainly womenâ\\x80\\x99s advocates against Hamiltonians newly empowered by the unlikely success of their heroâ\\x80\\x99s story on Broadway. Mr. Lewâ\\x80\\x99s design proposals are the culmination of 10 months of   public commentary that began almost immediately after he invited Americans last June to help him decide which woman from history to honor on the $10 bill. That   initiative proved to be hardly as simple as he first imagined. Immediately an online group called Women on 20s insisted that the woman to be honored  â\\x80\\x94   Tubman was its choice  â\\x80\\x94   had to go on the more common $20 note, displacing not the popular Hamilton but Jackson, whose place in history has suffered lately with attention to his record of forcibly relocating Native Americans, supporting slavery and  â\\x80\\x94   despite his prominence on currency  â\\x80\\x94   opposing a national banking system and paper money. But the $10 was next in line for redesign, based on federal officialsâ\\x80\\x99 assessment of counterfeiting threats. Yet other women mobilized by the Girlsâ\\x80\\x99 Lounge, a networking organization for female corporate leaders, demanded that a woman go on the $10 note, as Mr. Lew first proposed, because they did not want to wait years for a new $20 bill. Within the administration, Rosie Rios, who as treasurer of the United States oversees the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, was also pushing for a woman on the $10 bill. But nothing so roiled the debate as the phenomenon of the musical â\\x80\\x9cHamilton. â\\x80\\x9d Weighing in for his place on the $10 bill were    theater patrons and teenagers rapping to the soundtrack, as well as the showâ\\x80\\x99s creator and star,   Miranda. When Mr. Lew and his wife caught a performance last August, the Treasury secretary hinted to Mr. Miranda that Hamilton would stay. Just this week, the show won the Pulitzer Prize for drama. By July, in fact, Mr. Lew already had decided to keep his   predecessor on the $10 note, and put a vignette of suffragists on the back, with Tubman scheduled for the $20 bill and changes to the $5 note as well. â\\x80\\x9cI had a kind of â\\x80\\x98ahaâ\\x80\\x99 moment where I said weâ\\x80\\x99re thinking too small,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lew said on Wednesday. He decided to redesign all three notes to accommodate the various views, and sooner. As for the choice of Tubman, he said that in the public comments he reviewed each night, â\\x80\\x9cthe pattern became clear that Harriet Tubman struck a chord with people in all parts of the country, of all ages. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThis is a good solution,â\\x80\\x9d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who wrote to the secretary â\\x80\\x9cstrongly suggesting he not remove Hamiltonâ\\x80\\x9d from the bill. Mr. Lew directed the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to hasten the redesign of the $20 and $5 notes at the same time. Subsequent production of the $10 bill would take precedence, though Mr. Lew said all three notes could be in wallets before 2030. The final decision on release is up to the Fed. One wild card is that Mr. Lew and President Obama have just months left in office. But Mr. Lew expressed confidence that his successors would not veto the currency makeovers. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s going to probably want to do that  â\\x80\\x94   to take the image of Harriet Tubman off of our money? To take the image of the suffragists off?â\\x80\\x9d he said. Not since 1929 has American currency undergone such a   change. That year all paper money changed, with more standard designs and smaller size to save costs. In advance of Mr. Lewâ\\x80\\x99s decision, the emotion that the Treasury initiative had prompted was reflected in a letter to the Treasury secretary on Tuesday evening. More than three dozen women including actors, feminists, corporate executives and journalists objected to preliminary news reports that he was planning to renege on putting a woman on the $10 face, calling it, if true, â\\x80\\x9ca major blow to the advancement of women. â\\x80\\x9d They admonished the Treasury secretary, saying: â\\x80\\x9c Could there be a better metaphor for   status that continues to limit our girls?â\\x80\\x9d The signers included the actresses Ellen DeGeneres, Geena Davis and Jane Lynch the former soccer star Abby Wambach former Representative Gabrielle Giffords the news media figures Katie Couric and Arianna Huffington the feminist leader Gloria Steinem and the photographer Annie Leibovitz. Mr. Lewâ\\x80\\x99s compromise did not satisfy the letter writers since the new note, the $10 bill, will picture women on the back. But Women on 20s released a statement â\\x80\\x9ccelebratingâ\\x80\\x9d the decision, despite Mr. Lewâ\\x80\\x99s inability to say how quickly the government can accelerate a new $20 note given technological and production complexities. Yet, as Mr. Lew said Wednesday: â\\x80\\x9cI said we were going to listen. We really did listen. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'Oregon Standoff Acquittal Sparks Fears of New Land Disputes 11/01/2016 \\nAGWEB \\nThe stunning acquittal of seven people who occupied a federal wildlife sanctuary in Oregon during an armed standoff raised fears Friday that the verdict could embolden other militant groups in a long-running dispute over government-owned Western lands. \\nMeanwhile, a juror said the decision was a rejection of the prosecutionâ\\x80\\x99s conspiracy case, not an endorsement of the defendantsâ\\x80\\x99 actions. \\nSupporters of Ammon Bundy celebrated the verdict and said it could invite more confrontations. The governmentâ\\x80\\x99s top federal land official, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, issued a statement urging all employees to â\\x80\\x9cremain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.â\\x80\\x9d \\nAn activist from Boise, Idaho, who once camped by a memorial to occupier LaVoy Finicum at the site where he was shot dead by police, predicted that the verdict would encourage others to act. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think a lot more people will be revolting, rebelling and standing up against what we see as a tyrannical government,â\\x80\\x9d William C. Fisher said in a telephone interview. \\nThe 41-day takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge last January in remote eastern Oregon was part of a larger debate about the use of federal lands in the West. The militants led by Bundy, a small business owner from Arizona, wanted to hand the refuge over to local officials, saying the federal government should not have dominion over it. \\nThe U.S. government owns nearly half of all land in the West, compared with only 4 percent in other states, according to the Congressional Overview of Federal Land Ownership. \\nOne of the jurors in the case asserted Friday that the panel was not endorsing militancy to resolve those issues. \\nThe juror, identified only as Juror No. 4, wrote in an email to The Oregonian/OregonLive that the verdicts were a â\\x80\\x9cstatementâ\\x80\\x9d about the prosecutionâ\\x80\\x99s failure to prove a conspiracy charge â\\x80\\x9cand not any form of affirmation of the defenseâ\\x80\\x99s various beliefs, actions or aspirations.â\\x80\\x9d \\nThe acquittal of the white occupiers came on the same day that officers in riot gear evicted protesters from private land in the path of the Dakota Access oil pipeline in rural North Dakota. Officers fired bean bags and pepper spray as they surrounded demonstrators, many of them Native Americans who have spent months fighting over tribal rights and the projectâ\\x80\\x99s environmental effects. At least 117 people were arrested. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre we going to look at these protests the same way?â\\x80\\x9d asked John Freemuth, a public land policy expert at Boise State University. â\\x80\\x9cI certainly think the tribes will have a point if they find themselves arrested and in jail and these Oregon guys get off.â\\x80\\x9d \\nBundy, his brother Ryan Bundy and five others were charged with conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the refuge. \\nChris Rasmussen, a defense lawyer in an armed standoff case that happened two years ago at Bundyâ\\x80\\x99s fatherâ\\x80\\x99s ranch in Nevada, said it is â\\x80\\x9cobviousâ\\x80\\x9d that Oregon prosecutors gambled in seeking convictions on felony conspiracy charges instead of misdemeanor trespassing charges. \\nBut prosecutors had few other options for serious charges because the defendants never attacked anyone, said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and a former federal prosecutor. \\nRather than attempting to retake the refuge headquarters and risking a gunbattle, authorities took a cautious approach. They closed nearby roads and stayed miles away while urging the occupiers to abandon the land. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe upside of not confronting them was it was less likely there would be violence,â\\x80\\x9d Levenson said. â\\x80\\x9cThe downside was it was less likely that they could use the assault charge.â\\x80\\x9d \\nThe standoff finally ended when the Bundys and other key figures were arrested in a Jan. 26 traffic stop outside the refuge. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s when Finicum was killed. Most occupiers left after his death, but four holdouts remained until Feb. 11, when they surrendered following lengthy negotiations. \\nBundy remains in jail because he still faces charges in the standoff at his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s Nevada ranch. \\nJoel Hansen, Cliven Bundyâ\\x80\\x99s attorney, said Friday that he thinks the jury in Oregon â\\x80\\x9csaw through the liesâ\\x80\\x9d of a government that â\\x80\\x9cis trying to prove these Bundybrothers and their compatriots were some kind of terrorists.â\\x80\\x9d \\nFor Hansen and some others in the rural West, ownership of public land is a constitutional question that has not been settled. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is a seething anger among those who use the land,â\\x80\\x9d he said, citing the feelings of ranchers, loggers, miners and Indians. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all part of tyrannical oppression. Their goal is to manage them out of business to get them off the land.â\\x80\\x9d \\nThe Oregon occupiers had chosen, perhaps inadvertently, a part of Oregon where locals and the feds had a recent history of working together. Few who live near the sanctuary welcomed the occupiers, most of whom were from out of state. \\nNot long before the takeover began on Jan. 2, locals and federal officials had determined the fate of large swaths of land, Harney County Judge Steve Grasty, the top local administrative official, said last summer in an interview. \\nThe High Desert Partnership in Harney County, a group that includes the Bureau of Land Management, the Nature Conservancy and timber business owners, had been working quietly to determine land stewardship, which Jewell credited in her statement on Friday.',\n",

       " 'ANKARA (Reuters) - A strong earthquake of magnitude 6.0 struck southeastern Iran on Friday, injuring at least 42 people and destroying several homes in an area where most people live in villages of mud-walled homes. State media said no deaths had been reported. Rescue workers, special teams with sniffer dogs and units of Iran s Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia forces were sent to the quake-hit areas in Kerman province, Iran s semi-official Fars news agency said. State TV said many residents rushed out of houses in Kerman city and nearby villages and towns, fearing more tremors after some 51 aftershocks following the 6:32 a.m. (0232 GMT) quake.  The quake destroyed some houses in 14 villages but so far there has been no fatalities,  a local official told state TV.  Fortunately no deaths have been reported so far.  The quake struck less than three weeks after a magnitude 7.3 earthquake hit villages and towns in Iran s western Kermansheh province along the mountainous border with Iraq, killing 530 people and injuring thousands of others.  The U.S. Geological Survey said Friday s quake, at first reported as magnitude 6.3, was centered 36 miles (58 km) northeast of Kerman city, which has a population of more than 821,000. The quake was very shallow, at a depth of 6.2 miles (10 km), which would have amplified the shaking in the poor, sparsely populated area. Head of Relief and Rescue Organization of Iran s Red Crescent Morteza Salimi told state television that at least 42 people were injured. Iran s state news agency IRNA said most of those hurt had minor injuries.   Assessment teams are surveying the earthquake-stricken areas and villages in Kerman province,  IRNA quoted local official Mohammadreza Mirsadeqi as saying.   Iran s semi-official Tasnim news agency said the quake had caused heavy damage in Hojedk town and some villages were hit by power and water cuts.  State TV aired footage of damaged buildings in remote mountainous villages near Hojedk town, the epicenter of the earthquake with a population of 3,000 people. TV said coal mines in the area had been closed because of aftershocks.  Iran s Red Crescent said emergency shelter, food and water had been sent to the quake-hit areas.  Criss-crossed by several major fault lines, Iran is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 quake in Kerman province killed 31,000 people and flattened the ancient city of Bam. ',\n",
       " 'SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Friday signed a bill to allow businesses across the state to carry epinephrine auto-injectors, but sharply admonished drugmaker Mylan NL over its recent price increases. Mylan has been widely criticized, including by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, for raising the price of EpiPens, which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies. The company, which acquired the product in 2007, recently raised the list price for a pair of EpiPen auto-injectors to $600. The price has been rising from a cost of about $100 in 2008. A probe into EpiPen pricing by a U.S. Senate subcommittee was announced on Sept. 7. Brownâ\\x80\\x99s decision on Friday highlights the predicament facing allergy advocates, who strongly support epinephrine access legislation but have criticized Mylanâ\\x80\\x99s pricing.  Over two dozen U.S. states have passed laws similar to Californiaâ\\x80\\x99s authorizing businesses to stock epinephrine, according to advocacy group Food Allergy Research & Education.  Brown said he was signing the bill because EpiPens save lives, but that he strongly objected to Mylanâ\\x80\\x99s pricing. â\\x80\\x9cState government cannot stop unconscionable price increases, but it can shed light on such rapacious corporate behavior,â\\x80\\x9d Brown said in a statement. A Mylan representative could not immediately be reached for comment. EpiPen, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, delivers a potentially life-saving dose of epinephrine by injection into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions, including to peanuts and bee stings. Mylan owns 94 percent of the market for such auto-injected devices.     In response to the furor over pricing, Mylan last month said it would sell its own generic version of EpiPen for $300. ',\n",
       " 'SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva should be cleared of any wrongdoing in one of several corruption cases pending against him in federal court due to a lack of evidence, prosecutors said on Friday. The federal prosecutors said in a statement that former Senator Delcidio Amaral had lied about Lula, as one of the country s most popular politicians is known, as part of a plea-bargain agreement. His testimony was key to Lula s legal entanglements, the statement added, saying Amaral himself should be put on trial for perjury. Amaral has accused Lula of working with billionaire financier Andre Esteves to buy the silence of a top executive at Petroleo Brasileiro, the state-controlled oil company, about alleged corrupt acts committed by Lula. The obstruction of justice case is one of five for which Lula is still expected to go on trial in federal court.   The prosecutors also recommended that charges against Esteves, the founder, former chief executive officer and largest shareholder in investment bank Grupo BTG Pactual SA, be dropped. Lula s legal team, in a written statement, welcomed the prosecutors  statement as  just  and said it proved he never acted to obstruct justice. Amaral s lawyer Eduardo Marzagao denied that his client had lied, however. The former president was convicted in July in a separate case and sentenced to 9-1/2 years in prison for accepting 3.7 million reais ($1.18 million) worth of bribes from engineering firm OAS SA [OAS.UL]. That ruling marked a stunning fall for Lula, a founder of the Workers Party, and a serious blow to his chances of a political comeback. The former union leader, who remains free pending an appeal, won global praise for policies to reduce inequality in Brazil.  The verdict represented the highest-profile conviction yet in a sweeping corruption investigation that has rattled Brazil for more than three years, revealing a sprawling system of graft at top levels of business and government. More than 100 powerful business and political figures have been found guilty since the anti-graft push began in early 2014. Brazil s lower house of Congress voted last month to reject a corruption charge against current President Michel Temer for allegedly taking bribes, sparing him from facing a possible Supreme Court trial that could have ousted him from office. More corruption charges are expected to filed in the coming weeks against Temer, Rodrigo Janot, Brazil s prosecutor general, has said. ',\n",

       " 'It is so great to be back in Florida, my second home. Let me also thank our good and dear friend, Chairman Jeff Miller, for joining us here today. We ve worked closely together on developing much-needed reforms to take care of our Veterans.Let me open by making this very important declaration: I love this state, I love the people of this state, and together we are going to have an amazing victory in November.Decades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end, and a New American Future will begin.The citizens of this country will be in charge once more.The special interests have had their day. That chapter in our history is closing. The history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday. A new chapter is beginning, and this chapter will be authored by you, the American people.This will be your time. You will be running the show. Not the donors, not the insiders, not the media executives.Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.All we have to do is cut our ties to the bitter failures of the past, and anything becomes possible.Change is coming.All the people who ve rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop.It s your turn now. This is your time.The fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change   not partisan change.We are fighting for all Americans   Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Conservatives, Liberals   who ve been failed by this corrupt system. We re fighting for everyone who doesn t have a voice.We re also fighting for every region of this country. For every part of Florida, and every part of America. From Pensacola to Pittsburgh, from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, we are fighting for every last city and every last person in this country.Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the past.Ours is the campaign of the future.In this future, we are going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first   and that keep jobs in our country. All the people who got NAFTA wrong, and China wrong, and who are trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership   are the same failed voices pushing for Hillary Clinton.Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. We ve lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA. China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs. We are going to stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in America. The era of economic surrender is over.We will also have a very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country   and we re going to build a border wall, and Mexico will pay for it.In this new future, we are going to raise your wages. Household incomes are over $4,000 less today than they were in the year 2000.My tax, trade, energy, immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages up. Hillary Clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich at your personal expense. Many people in this room tonight, and across this country, haven t seen a real wage increase in 18 years.The people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton   much of it to her personal bank account   to keep you from having the future you deserve.But on November 8th, you get to vote for the future you want.In this future, we are going to pursue new education policies. At the center of my plan is school choice. I want every disadvantaged child in America to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their family.In this future, we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined Hillary Clinton s career.To keep our country out of war, we will remember those three very famous words: Peace Through Strength.That means rebuilding our badly depleted military. I laid out a detailed plan this week to re-invest in our military and our troops.We are going to build a 350 ship Navy, a 540,000 soldier Army, an Air Force of 1,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions. Crucially, we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense.We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs.As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.Just today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State.One more massive Hillary Clinton failure.Just like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons.Hillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen. Her policies have produced massive global disorder.She handed Iraq over to ISIS, unleashing that terror group onto the world. ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made.She helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood. Fortunately, President El-Sisi is now in charge, but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country.She helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too   without any plan for the day after.She failed with China, which has only grown more aggressive. By the way, she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.And of course, Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset. She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return. Then, she gave up 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia  while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons.Let s not forget, Russia went into Crimea on President Obama s watch.Unlike Clinton and Obama, we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength   not weakness. And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton.The difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin, and in all negotiations, is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States.Hillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States. Putin laughs at our leaders, and takes them to the cleaners again and again.That is why we will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position of leadership in the world   so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again.If I cannot get a good deal for the United States, I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away. That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States, ever. They just keep losing.I will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States.But I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal. We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we won t get trapped in the failed approaches of the past. A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children.We will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and a clear understanding of our many, many differences. I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have. No more apology tours. No more bowing to foreign powers. We proudly defend America at every single turn.America will get the respect it deserves.And if we don t, I will walk away from the deal like you ve never seen anyone walk before. And, believe me, within a short while, they will come back   but only on my terms, therefore the terms of the American people.On these principles, we will pursue our long-term goals of peace   for the sake of our kids, and for the sake of the world s future.Hillary Clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved, and at a very high price for the world.Her policies have produced only death and destruction, not diplomacy. She s trigger-happy, pushing recklessly for regime change   but never creating or promoting stability, or advancing the core interests of the United States.Her only real achievement as Secretary of State has been getting away with her massive email scandal. She bleached, deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from Congress.She lied to Congress while under oath, and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authorities.By the way, who has thirteen phones in the first place? Only somebody with a whole lot to hide.And we all know what Hillary Clinton was hiding. She was hiding her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.Hillary Clinton isn t just part of the corrupt establishment, she is the corrupt establishment.I just saw her press conference today where Hillary Clinton complained about all of the problems in the world. If only we d had a competent Secretary of State who could have prevented all of these problems from happening.Throughout it all, Hillary Clinton and her Foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth. Hillary Clinton and her Foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women, that murder gays, and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scale.My Administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed, including the millions of women being oppressed by Radical Islam.Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure. Yet people keep giving her money and protecting her.It s the powerful protecting the powerful.The insiders fighting for insiders.I am fighting for you.trump im with youAll the people advising Hillary Clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts, and the tragedies in the Middle East.I am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win   and how to avoid endless war.Let me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform, but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country.There is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people.It is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain. That means we don t issue timetables for political reasons, but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory.We will pursue a new, steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States   not a reckless, interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly.And we will be clear in naming our enemy: Radical Islamic Terrorism.The fact that Hillary Clinton can t even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country. This is one single fact she can never escape.Any country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this mission.We will break the cycle of regime change, and refugee crisis, that has gone on for so many years.We simply can t afford to continue down the road we are on right now.That applies to everything.Change is needed at every single level of our society.When I talk about making America Great Again, I m talking about creating a future that includes each and every American.I want the most inclusive, generous and prosperous society we have ever had.The possibilities for our future are unlimited.The Hillary Clinton campaign is so small, so petty, so tired.If we just break from this bitter, divisive past, we can achieve anything.That also means breaking from the lies and the deceit of the Clintons. They want to scare you out of voting for change. The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton, who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist   now they ve unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase. It s just one more Clinton lie, one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve.When I talk about Making America Great Again, I m talking about making it Great Again for Everyone   but especially for all of the Americans who have been left behind.We are the campaign of unity, and we will deliver amazing things for all of our people.New schools, new factories, new infrastructure.Beautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation. We will develop Detroit, Not Beijing.Most importantly, we will fight to end the systemic poverty in our inner cities, and to lift millions of African-Americans and Hispanics out of poverty.Here, in Florida, we have such an amazing and diverse community of Hispanic-Americans   from Cuba, from Puerto Rico, from Venezuela, from Haiti, from all over.These incredible Americans will have in Donald J. Trump a President who is determined to fight for their jobs, their wages, their schools, and their futures.To all Hispanic-Americans who want better jobs and higher wages: I will be your champion.All working people, of all backgrounds and from all places, will have a true friend in Donald Trump.In particular, I have a very special place in my heart for those who make a living as tradesmen, craftsmen and construction workers.I ve spent my professional life among construction workers, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers. I feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than Wall Street executives. There s a reason the hedge fund managers are funding Hillary Clinton s campaign, and not mine.My campaign is powered by my own money, but also small dollar donations from people like all of you who just want their country back.This is our chance. It s our last chance to give the people control over their own futures once again.Gleaming new plants stretching across our nation.Young Latino children getting an amazing education at the school of their choice   and their parents having their jobs protected from unfair competition.Our Veterans will get the best healthcare in the world. You can read the whole plan on our website, DonaldJTrump.com.Massive tax reductions and tax simplification   so that you can keep more of your precious time and your hard-earned money. Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes big time.Most importantly, 2017 will be about unity.Once again, we will be One American Nation.We Will Be One American People.Just imagine what we can accomplish together if we set aside our differences, and focus on what we have in common as Americans.We will be one people, living under One God, saluting one beautiful American Flag.We Will Make America Proud Again.We Will Make America Prosperous Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.Friends and fellow citizens, We Will Make America Great Again!',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - Conservative frontrunner Sebastian Pinera and center-left Alejandro Guillier lead a crowded field of candidates in Chile s presidential election on Sunday, widely seen as a referendum on the reforms of outgoing President Michelle Bachelet. The following are the main policies supported by Pinera and Guillier: - A billionaire businessman who served as president from 2010 to 2014, Pinera has promised to make Chile the first country in Latin America to achieve  developed nation  status in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based club of wealthy nations. - Pinera, the market favorite, would cut corporate taxes to increase investments and said his policies would double economic growth in his term. - Pinera s $14 billion, four-year spending plan includes an overhaul of Bachelet s tax reform that would cost $2.7 billion in new investments in infrastructure and hospitals. Pinera said he would pay for his proposals by cutting  unnecessary  government spending and simplifying the tax code. - Pinera s $3 billion plan to revitalize Chile s pension system, which is criticized as delivering small payouts, includes new subsidies to raise pensions for women and the middle class, as well as incentives to encourage workers to retire later. - To help revive cash-strapped state miner Codelco, the world s No. 1 copper producer, Pinera has committed to overturn a dictatorship-era law that transfers 10 percent of the company s export sales to the military. He also wants Codelco to deploy a  realistic investment plan using existing resources  and to focus on existing assets rather than new projects. - Guillier, a former journalist elected to the Senate in 2013, has pledged to diversify Chile s economy away from the dominant copper industry. He wants to add value to commodities exports by processing more copper at home and give communities outside Santiago a stronger say in decision-making. - Following the lead of ally Bachelet, Guillier has called for rewriting Chile s constitution to formally recognize indigenous communities and to codify the rights of workers to collective bargaining and to strike.  - To boost payouts from the pension system, Guillier has proposed raising fiscal spending on pensions and introducing a new, mandatory contribution from employers. Guillier would also increase regulation and oversight of private pension fund administrators. - Like Pinera, Guillier has called for the repeal of Codelco s mandatory contribution to the military, but wants the state-run miner to stay active abroad to ensure it remains the world s top copper producer. He has also signaled he would seek to maintain Codelco s relations with workers that has spared the company the strikes that have hit private miners under Bachelet. ',\n",
       " 'It was, in Gary Johnsonâ\\x80\\x99s own words, another â\\x80\\x9cAleppo moment. â\\x80\\x9d During a town   interview on MSNBC on Wednesday night, Mr. Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for president, was asked by the host Chris Matthews to name his favorite foreign leader. Mr. Johnson, appearing flustered, was at a loss to come up with a name. He grasped at a former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox, who has been critical of Donald J. Trump, but was unable to remember his name without help  â\\x80\\x94   or the name of any sitting leader of a foreign country. â\\x80\\x9cI guess Iâ\\x80\\x99m having an Aleppo moment,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Mr. Johnson was referring to a remarkably similar episode earlier this month when, during another interview on MSNBC, he was asked how he would deal with the continuing situation in Aleppo, the ravaged Syrian city at the center of that countryâ\\x80\\x99s refugee crisis. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is Aleppo?â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Johnson said at the time. Mr. Matthews, who was interviewing Mr. Johnson and former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, his running mate, live at the University of New Hampshire, appeared to stall to give Mr. Johnson more time after the candidate repeated the initial question, looking slightly panicked. â\\x80\\x9cAny one of the continents, any country, name one foreign leader that you respect and look up to, anybody,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Matthews said. Mr. Johnson exhaled loudly. â\\x80\\x9cMine was Shimon Peres,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Weld interjected. Mr. Matthews clarified that he was looking for someone who was still alive. He then named various countries and continents  â\\x80\\x94   Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia  â\\x80\\x94   in an apparent attempt to jog Mr. Johnsonâ\\x80\\x99s memory. Mr. Johnson then made the â\\x80\\x9cAleppo momentâ\\x80\\x9d comment, indicating that he was having trouble coming up with Mr. Foxâ\\x80\\x99s name. â\\x80\\x9cBut Iâ\\x80\\x99m giving you the whole world!â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Matthews shouted, interrupting him. Mr. Weld eventually supplied Mr. Foxâ\\x80\\x99s last name to Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Matthews, apparently having given up on the presidential candidate, asked the eager Mr. Weld to name his own favorite foreign leader, looking to conclude a painful exchange that felt significantly longer than the 50 seconds or so that it lasted. Mr. Weld paused for half a second. â\\x80\\x9cUm, Merkel?â\\x80\\x9d he said, referring to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. â\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t argue with that,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Matthews said, as the crowd applauded.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - African countries should do more to pile pressure on South Sudan s political leaders, who seem incapable of resolving the country s four-year civil war, a top U.S. diplomat said on Wednesday.  We think there is more our African colleagues can and should be doing at this point, especially in terms of focusing on leadership, that from our point of view is behaving in a way that is very irresponsible,  Tom Shannon, U.S. under-secretary for political affairs at the State Department, told reporters. Shannon, speaking on the sidelines of a U.S-African Partnerships event at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said Washington had grown  intolerant  of South Sudan s leaders and the challenge was to work with African countries which are interested in seeing an end to the conflict.  This is a manmade conflict of horrific dimensions, which is about political leaders measuring each other through force at the cost of their populations,  said Shannon. His remarks come after the new USAID administrator, Mark Green, traveled to Juba on Sept. 2 to meet with South Sudan s President Salva Kiir and deliver a message from Washington that the United States was reviewing its relationship with his government.  The Trump administration last week imposed sanctions on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief for their role in the conflict, atrocities against civilians and  attacks against international missions in South Sudan.  South Sudan became the world s newest nation when it gained independence from Sudan in 2011. War broke out in late 2013 and more than a quarter of its population of 12 million have fled their homes.  A confidential report by the United Nations last week said competing efforts to end South Sudan s civil war were allowing Kiir s government to exploit divisions among the international brokers. East African leaders said in June they want the warring sides to recommit to a peace deal they abandoned more than a year ago. . Among the international bodies trying to end the conflict are regional block IGAD, the U.N. Security Council, a troika of South Sudan s main Western backers prior to independence and an African Union panel. ',\n",

Maybe it s an old Howard Stern recording in which someone reminds him that he says he likes to go to Russia to have sex with women because they  have no morals. That s pretty interesting considering the current situation, but it s probably the recent bombshell report by a BBC correspondent that there are at least four sources for what Trump is calling fake news. According to Paul Wood in a recent op-ed:Claims about a Russian blackmail tape were made in one of a series of reports written by a former British intelligence agent. As a member of MI6, he had been posted to the UK s embassy in Moscow and now runs a consultancy giving advice on doing business in Russia. He spoke to a number of his old contacts in the FSB, the successor to the KGB, paying some of them for information. .The former MI6 agent is not the only source for the claim about Russian kompromat on the president-elect. Back in August, a retired spy told me he had been informed of its existence by  the head of an East European intelligence agency .Later, I used an intermediary to pass some questions to active duty CIA officers dealing with the case file  they would not speak to me directly. I got a message back that there was  more than one tape ,  audio and video , on  more than one date , in  more than one place  in the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow and also in St Petersburg  and that the material was  of a sexual nature . The claims of Russian kompromat on Mr Trump were  credible , the CIA believed. .Last April, the CIA director was shown intelligence that worried him. It was  allegedly  a tape recording of a conversation about money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign.It was passed to the US by an intelligence agency of one of the Baltic States.The CIA cannot act domestically against American citizens so a joint counter-intelligence taskforce was created .A lawyer  outside the Department of Justice but familiar with the case  told me that three of Mr Trump s associates were the subject of the inquiry.  But it s clear this is about Trump,  he said.Audio. And. Video.Trump spent well over a half hour attacking Hillary Clinton and screaming about how the Kremlin is right. He did this a week before he officially becomes President. Is this what it s going to be like for the next four years?Featured image via Getty Images (Scott Olson)/screengrab',\n",
       " 'RIO DE JANEIRO  â\\x80\\x94   As if this city did not have enough problems to overcome, rain and high winds swept through here shortly before the closing ceremony, sending branches and balcony fixtures plummeting onto sidewalks and automobile hoods. In what by now is standard fashion at these Olympics, the Brazilians soldiered on and found a way, even on backup generator power at the MaracanÃ£ stadium. It was a   Games: full of challenges and contrasts, abrupt shifts in mood and momentum. It was no doubt quite a mess backstage and yet quite a spectacle at the front of the house. But now it is time for the traditional wrap parties and an extra layer of relief, and definitely time to hand out our traditional Olympic prizes (before something else falls from the sky). Best Performance on Land Bolt. Bolt. Itâ\\x80\\x99s always about Usain Bolt, and, yes, he went three for three again in the gold medal department, holding off the fading threats (Justin Gatlin) and the rising stars (Andre De Grasse) without looking as if he were quite giving it his full attention. That, of course, is part of his charm. What will track  â\\x80\\x94   or the second week of the Olympics  â\\x80\\x94   do without him? But this yearâ\\x80\\x99s farewell run lacked both the element of surprise and the element of  . Boltâ\\x80\\x99s times in major championships have been increasing for years now. For the novelty factor and the wow factor, there was no surpassing the American Simone Biles. Even if she was a     world champion, she was an Olympic rookie, and her explosive and exuberant brand of gymnastics leapt off any screen in any culture. For all those who tuned in or actually made it to their seats in Rio, her performances redefined human limits, just as Boltâ\\x80\\x99s sprinting did in 2008 and 2009. Worst Performance on Land There was no shortage of candidates  â\\x80\\x94   including the   American goalkeeper Hope Solo  â\\x80\\x94   but only one genuine contender. Ryan Lochte should definitely have stayed in the pool. Best Performance in Water Phelps. Phelps. Itâ\\x80\\x99s always about Michael Phelps, and, yes, he won five more gold medals, this time at age 31. But three of those came in relays, and in one of those, Phelps was given a big lead heading into his anchor leg. As remarkable as Phelps remains, the United Statesâ\\x80\\x99 swimming success was the result of a genuine team effort, and not just because of Katie Ledeckyâ\\x80\\x99s freestyle dominance. The Americans also got individual gold medals from five other swimmers, including members of the new wave (Ryan Murphy) and the old guard (Anthony Ervin). After giving few hints of such    success at last yearâ\\x80\\x99s world championships, the Americans stormed back to win 33 swimming medals in Rio, more than three times what any other nation could muster. Worst Performance in Water It took another collective performance to secure this prize, and it deserves to be shared by all those still unidentified individuals who contributed to turning the water in the Olympic diving pool from transparent blue to opaque green. Hydrogen peroxide? Inactive chlorine? Whatever the latest excuse, this was not the body of water that the world was worried about Rio keeping clean. Best Performance on Water Blair Tuke and Peter Burling, soon to resume preparing with New Zealand for the Americaâ\\x80\\x99s Cup, were utterly dominant in the 49er class. Danuta Kozak of Hungary won three more gold medals in womenâ\\x80\\x99s kayak, bringing her career total to five. The womenâ\\x80\\x99s eight from the United States rowed to yet another gold of their own. But there was no better sea story in Rio than Santiago Lange of Argentina. The oldest sailor in the Olympic fleet at age 54, Lange learned he had lung cancer last year and had part of one lung surgically removed. But he still made it to the starting line for South Americaâ\\x80\\x99s first Olympics. He and his sailing partner, Cecilia Carranza Saroli, were not the favorites in the new mixed multihull Nacra 17 event. Yet they managed to win the gold medal by just one point, and when it was over, Langeâ\\x80\\x99s sons, who competed in the 49er class in Rio, swam out to celebrate with him. Worst Performance on Water Conditions, to be polite, were not always ideal on the Olympic rowing course in Rioâ\\x80\\x99s scenic Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, where winds whipped up choppy conditions and forced some delays. But the lagoon was comparatively calm when Vladislav Yakovlev of Kazakhstan managed just 10 strokes before capsizing in his single scull. Based on water quality studies of the lagoon before the Olympics, this was definitely not the place to get wet. So what did Yakovlev do? The next day, he capsized again. Best Performance in Midair The Bahamian sprinter Shaunae Millerâ\\x80\\x99s desperate,   lunge across the line to beat the American Allyson Felix in the womenâ\\x80\\x99s 400 meters is clearly on the shortlist. But to be fair, Miller barely left the ground. Weâ\\x80\\x99re going with the athlete who soared the highest in the Olympic Stadium: Thiago Braz da Silva of Brazil. Coming into the Games, his personal best in the pole vault had been 5. 93 meters, or about 19 feet six inches. But when he and the host nation needed it most, he cleared 6. 03 meters to set an Olympic record and upset the   holder, Renaud Lavillenie of France. It was a gold medal few saw coming, and it was Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s only medal in track and field at its Games. Worst Performance in Midair Nadezhda Bazhina of Russia is no tourist athlete. She is a former European champion in the   springboard. But she made a splash for another reason in Rio: mistiming her takeoff during the preliminaries and leaving the board at a suboptimal angle. The result was a back flop that was seen, heard and streamed round the world. Final score for a dive that was not really a dive: zero points. Best Performance   It is tempting to lean toward the television program Ã\\x89 CampeÃ£o, and its assemblage of past Olympic greats, including Mark Spitz, Carl Lewis and Nadia Comaneci, all of whom appeared nightly on the Brazilian channel SporTV. They worked with translation, although no translation was required when they finally signed off at around 2 a. m. on Monday morning with a farewell conga line in which we discovered that the former American gymnast Bart Conner is a whole lot shorter than the former Cuban high jumper Javier Sotomayor. But for true cool on live television, weâ\\x80\\x99re going with Bolt, who after winning yet another footrace was asked for the umpteenth time in his career about his favorite Bob Marley song. The Jamaican responded by singing â\\x80\\x9cOne Loveâ\\x80\\x9d for Brazilian TV. Worst Performance   It is tempting to say it could have happened to anyone. There is a lot of churn and froth in an Olympic pool, and when the menâ\\x80\\x99s 200 individual medley race began, Elliotte Friedman called it the way he saw it. Unfortunately, Friedman, a Canadian broadcaster working for CBC, saw it wrong, mistaking Ryan Lochte in Lane 5 for Michael Phelps in Lane 4. â\\x80\\x9cFinally, heâ\\x80\\x99s going to do it,â\\x80\\x9d Friedman declared with understandable emphasis. â\\x80\\x9cRyan Lochte is going to beat Michael Phelps in this event in the Games. â\\x80\\x9d Instead it was Phelps who was well out in front. Lochte finished fifth. And although by the end of the Olympics nobody was confusing Phelps for Lochte in or out of the water, Friedman, to his credit, got the   call just right. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sorry everyone,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote on Twitter. â\\x80\\x9cI blew it. No excuses. â\\x80\\x9d Best Performance, Medal in Hand The story, in normal circumstances, would have been all about the American teamâ\\x80\\x99s becoming the first to win a second gold medal in womenâ\\x80\\x99s water polo. But the story became considerably more poignant when its coach, Adam Krikorian, received a phone call two days before the Games informing him that his    brother, Blake, had died in a surfing accident. After returning to the States for a few days, Krikorian came back to Rio. His players prevailed, and after they received their medals, each player  â\\x80\\x94   one by one  â\\x80\\x94   approached the coach and placed her medal around his neck. Worst Performance, Medal in Hand The dark side of Brazâ\\x80\\x99s gold medal in the pole vault was that the Brazilian crowd, sparse though it was, booed the Lavillenie during the competition as he  â\\x80\\x94   quite rightly  â\\x80\\x94   tried to clear the same heights and win. The reaction was rough yet forgivable in the heat of the Olympic moment and in light of Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s lack of a track and field culture. But the crowd crossed the line the next night in Olympic Stadium as it booed Lavillenie again as he received his silver medal. True, Lavillenie had not helped his cause by comparing his lot during the competition to that of Jesse Owens in 1936 in Berlin  â\\x80\\x94   a comparison he quickly retracted. But this was not Brazil vs. Argentina or Flamengo vs. Fluminense. This felt like the host nation ganging up on a single foreign visitor, one who did not deserve to have tears streaming down his face on the podium. Best Performance Per Capita The Caribbean still rules. Tiny Grenada, with slightly more than 100, 000 inhabitants, topped the standings on medalspercapita. com (yes, every Olympic digital niche is filling up fast). But Grenada only won one medal, a silver by the sprinter Kirani James, the defending Olympic champion in the 400. This year, James was thoroughly overshadowed (outside Grenada) by the South African Wayde van Niekerkâ\\x80\\x99s gold medal and world record in Lane 8. For planetary impact per capita, it remains best to go with Jamaica, which might have won only one medal for every 247, 000 of its inhabitants but still has the worldâ\\x80\\x99s fastest man (Bolt) and fastest woman (the newcomer Elaine Thompson). Worst Performance Per Capita Only two medals and no golds for India, well on its way to supplanting China as the worldâ\\x80\\x99s most populous nation. Time to retire the trophy? Certainly not, but perhaps time to get cricket into the Olympics (everything else seems to be included).',\n",
       " 'BANGKOK (Reuters) - Rights groups on Wednesday urged the European Union and Japan to consider halting their funding for the election panel in Cambodia, if the ruling party succeeds in a bid to dissolve the main opposition party ahead of next year s general election. The ruling Cambodia People s Party (CPP) has launched a crackdown on its critics, including politicians, independent media and non-government bodies. Nearly half the opposition members of parliament have fled abroad since September. In a session boycotted by the opposition, Cambodia s parliament voted on Monday to change party laws to re-distribute seats if a party is dissolved. The measure came after the government filed a lawsuit this month seeking to dissolve the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).  If the government s position to dissolve the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party succeeds, next year s election will be a joke,  Phil Robertson, deputy director for Asia at New York-based group Human Rights Watch, told Reuters.  At that point, both the EU and Japan should face reality and terminate their financial and technical assistance to avoid lending credibility to what will be a charade of democracy,  he added, speaking after a news conference in Bangkok. Japan and the EU are the two biggest foreign funders of the 2018 vote. China and the United States have also contributed, with the United States providing trucks and technical support, while Japan has given computers. Japan s embassy in Phnom Penh did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on the matter. George Edgar, head of the EU delegation to Cambodia, said the EU remains  ready to support a credible electoral process  but added that the polls should only go ahead with the opposition s involvement. He urged Cambodian authorities not to go ahead with the dissolution of the opposition party.  The EU remains ready to support a credible electoral process up to the National Assembly election in 2018. However we do not believe that a process from which the main opposition party was arbitrarily excluded could be seen as legitimate,  Edgar told Reuters. Cambodia s election commission was not immediately available for comment. The CPP has used  dirty tricks  to jail opposition leaders and force others into exile, Robertson added. CNRP leader Kem Sokha was arrested on Sept. 3 and charged with treason after the government said he had conspired with foreign advisers to topple it. Cambodia is relying on a partisan judiciary to silence critics and  dismantle democracy , the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) said in a report on Wednesday.      Old laws are being dusted off and new laws are being created,  Kingsley Abbot, the group s southeast Asia adviser, told reporters.  And all of these have led to a list of seemingly politicized investigations.   In recent months, the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for more than 30 years, has revoked the licenses of about 15 independent radio stations. The Cambodia Daily, an English-language newspaper, was also forced to shut in September following government allegations of non-payment of millions of dollars in taxes.  Hun Sen has the backing of Beijing, which says it supports Cambodia s right to maintain its national security. ',\n",
       " 'The more a Trump run for the White House as a major party candidate sinks in, the more his blatant incompetence stands out. In this recent interview with Greta Van Susteren, Trump is discussing possibilities for the vice presidency, which Trump has announced will be unveiled at the GOP convention. The convention, already guaranteed to be the circus the sideshows have been building up to, will definitely have the highest viewer ratings of all time. Trump then hints that his VP pick will most likely be a person with a political background because he believes passing legislation is more important than using executive orders to get things done.Then it happened. The thing that will bring Donald Trump to his knees. He pretended to know what he was talking about and said something incredibly stupid. As the race goes on, more people with a little bit of knowledge about something are going to hear something like this and realize immediately that it s amazing that Donald Trump ever graduated high school. He s a showman who built a movement of stupidity on social media and reality television. His remarks to Van Susteren about executive orders prove that he is completely incompetent to hold the office that issues them:  We re not gonna do the executive order thing like Obama. He couldn t get anything passed You re not gonna do executive orders?  asked Van Stern,  No executive orders? Well, we ll see,  says Trump,   It depends on what, but President Obama has been signing a lot of executive orders nobody s ever heard of an executive order before. I mean, I know Bush signed them and other people have signed them, but all of a sudden it s like this major event to get things done. It would be nice to go back to the old-fashioned way   it s called passing legislation; having people get together to pass legislation. You can just hear Joe Pesci doing a scene from Goodfellas.  Hey, yo What the hell is dis  zecutive order bullsh*t. At ain t The way we do things in Hell s Kitchen.  It s ridiculous. President Obama and a team of lawyers combed the laws and precedents of our country, being fully qualified and empowered to do so, and imposed directives to the agencies under the purview of the executive branch, like the INS, as any chief executive of any company would do to those under him. When the president signs an executive order it doesn t become a law, it becomes the current policy of the federal government in its own dealings.That certainly can have a profound effect on shaping federal law, as it sends a profound statement, but as for the bulk of executive orders, they cover the mundane to the ridiculous and have been signed by every single United States President. President Obama has signed fewer than either of the Bush buffoons or Uncle Ronny Reagan. Donald Trump doesn t even need to be prompted to Palin himself. He just does it by complete instinct at this point.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republicans announced plans to vote next week on their latest bid to scuttle Obamacare even as a popular comedian who has become part of the U.S. healthcare debate denounced the bill and former President Barack Obama on Wednesday warned of â\\x80\\x9creal human suffering.â\\x80\\x9d President Donald Trump, who has expressed frustration at the Senateâ\\x80\\x99s failure thus far to pass legislation dismantling Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s signature legislative achievement, said â\\x80\\x9c47 or 48â\\x80\\x9d Republicans back the bill, which needs 50 votes for passage in the 100-seat Senate, which his Republican Party controls 52-48.  â\\x80\\x9cWe think this has a very good chance,â\\x80\\x9d Trump, who made replacing Obamacare a top 2016 campaign promise, told reporters during an appearance with Egyptâ\\x80\\x99s president in New York. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul opposes the bill. At least five other Republicans are undecided on it: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, John McCain of Arizona and Jerry Moran of Kansas. Republican Senator John Thune on Fox News said: â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re a handful of votes short of having the 50 that we need.â\\x80\\x9d As they worked to gather enough votes to win, after prior legislation failed in July, congressional Republicans and the White House were on the defensive after Jimmy Kimmel used his late-night TV show to blast the proposal and call Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, one of its two sponsors, a liar. â\\x80\\x9cThis guy, Bill Cassidy, just lied right to my face,â\\x80\\x9d Kimmel said on his show on Tuesday night, referring to the senator who since May had touted a â\\x80\\x9cJimmy Kimmel testâ\\x80\\x9d of standards any Obamacare replacement would need to possess. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was noncommittal on Tuesday about scheduling a vote, now intends to bring it to the Senate floor next week, said his spokesman David Popp. Republicans are using the measure Cassidy is sponsoring with fellow Senator Lindsey Graham to make one last push this year to pass legislation to roll back the 2010 Obamacare law, a goal of theirs for seven years, facing a Sept. 30 deadline. Avalere Health, a healthcare consultancy to hospitals and insurers, forecast that the bill would slash federal funding to states by $215 billion through 2026, with 34 states facing cuts. Hit hard would be Democratic-governed California and New York, which expanded the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled under Obamacare, while Republican-governed Texas, which did not expand Medicaid, would be a winner, Avalere said. It remained unclear if the bill, opposed by Democrats and top medical groups and hospitals, can attract the 50 votes needed for passage, with Vice President Mike Pence ready to cast a tie-breaking vote. In a speech in New York, Obama defended the Affordable Care Act, known informally as Obamacare, which expanded medical insurance to 20 million Americans. â\\x80\\x9cSo when I see people trying to undo that hard-won progress for the 50th or 60th time, with bills that would raise costs or reduce coverage or roll back protections for older Americans or people with pre-existing conditions ... it is aggravating,â\\x80\\x9d the Democratic former president said. â\\x80\\x9cAnd itâ\\x80\\x99s certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple of months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents.â\\x80\\x9d Cassidy defended his bill, which would divvy up healthcare money as block grants to states, let them opt out of some Obamacare consumer protections and waive requirements that insurers cover certain benefits. It also would end Obamacareâ\\x80\\x99s Medicaid expansion. Kimmel entered the healthcare debate after revealing on his show in May that his newborn son had undergone life-saving emergency surgery for a congenital heart condition, and pleaded that no family be denied medical care because they cannot afford it. Cassidy appeared that month on â\\x80\\x9cJimmy Kimmel Live!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHe said he would only support a healthcare bill that made sure a child like mine would get the health coverage he needs no matter how much money his parents make,â\\x80\\x9d Kimmel said on Tuesday. â\\x80\\x9cStop using my name, OK? Because I donâ\\x80\\x99t want my name on it. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a new â\\x80\\x98Jimmy Kimmel testâ\\x80\\x99 for you. Itâ\\x80\\x99s called the lie detector test. Youâ\\x80\\x99re welcome to stop by the studio and take it any time,â\\x80\\x9d he said to cheers from his audience. Cassidy, a gastroenterologist who represents Louisiana, gave a measured response to Kimmelâ\\x80\\x99s remarks, telling reporters on Capitol Hill, â\\x80\\x9cIt was a personal attack and I canâ\\x80\\x99t help that.â\\x80\\x9d  Graham blasted the comedian. â\\x80\\x9cI bet he looked at some liberal talking point, bought it hook, line and sinker, and went after Bill Cassidy without talking to him. And I think thatâ\\x80\\x99s unfair,â\\x80\\x9d Graham said on Fox News Channelâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cFox & Friendsâ\\x80\\x9d show.  Cassidy said his proposal would protect people who are already ill, although it does let states waive an Obamacare mandate that insurers cannot charge people who have pre-existing medical conditions more than those who are healthy. â\\x80\\x9cThere is a specific provision that says that if a state applies for a waiver, it must ensure that those with pre-existing conditions have affordable and adequate coverage,â\\x80\\x9d Cassidy told CNN. Trump, in a tweet late on Wednesday, said he would not sign the bill if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. â\\x80\\x9cIt does! A great bill,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. ',\n",
       " 'PHOENIX (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump revved up supporters on Tuesday with a defense of his response to a white supremacist-organized rally in Virginia and a promise to shut down the U.S. government if necessary to build a wall along the border with Mexico. Under fire for saying â\\x80\\x9cboth sidesâ\\x80\\x9d were to blame for the violence between white supremacists and left-wing counter protesters in Virginia on Aug. 12, Trump accused television networks of ignoring his calls for unity in the aftermath. â\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t say I love you because youâ\\x80\\x99re black, or I love you because youâ\\x80\\x99re white,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. â\\x80\\x9cI love all the people of our country.â\\x80\\x9d Police used pepper spray to disperse crowds after protesters threw rocks and bottles outside the convention center where Trump spoke, police said. Trump, who often uses news organizations as a foil, repeatedly singled out the media for criticism of how it covered the violence in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville and the resulting political fallout. â\\x80\\x9cThese are truly dishonest people. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re bad people. I really think they donâ\\x80\\x99t like our country,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. â\\x80\\x9cThe only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media.â\\x80\\x9d Adopting a glib tone, Trump said many reporters ignored his condemnation of white supremacists, including the Ku Klux Klan.  â\\x80\\x9cI hit â\\x80\\x98em with neo-Nazi, I hit â\\x80\\x98em with everything ... KKK? We have KKK. I got â\\x80\\x98em all,â\\x80\\x9d he said. James Clapper, a former director of U.S. national intelligence, expressed concern at Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s performance, calling it â\\x80\\x9cdownright scary and disturbing.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI question his fitness to be in office,â\\x80\\x9d Clapper told CNN. Funding for the border wall has flagged in the U.S. Congress as many lawmakers question whether Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s main promise during the 2016 presidential election campaign is really necessary. But with a budget battle looming, Trump said he would be willing to risk a politically damaging government shutdown in order to secure funding for the wall.  He visited the border region in Yuma, Arizona, earlier on Tuesday. â\\x80\\x9cIf we have to close down our government, weâ\\x80\\x99re building that wall,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re going to have our wall. The American people voted for immigration control. Weâ\\x80\\x99re going to get that wall.â\\x80\\x9d With thousands of supporters cheering him on, Trump also weighed in on another racially charged issue, hinting he would pardon former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Arpaio, 85, who battled illegal immigration in the Phoenix area, was found guilty last month of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case. Trump covered the gamut of issues, from NAFTA trade talks to the U.S. showdown with North Korea, during a raucous, rambling and defiant political speech lasting an hour and 15 minutes.  He said he might terminate the NAFTA treaty with Mexico and Canada to jumpstart negotiations, and said the standoff with North Korea over its weapons programs might have taken a positive turn. However, it was unclear whether the speech would help lay the foundation for a comeback from the deep political crisis Trump finds himself in after only seven months in office and an approval rating below 40 percent. He expressed frustration that the Republican-controlled Congress was unable to approve healthcare legislation that failed to pass the Senate by one vote last month. One of the votes against the legislation was cast by  Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was recently  diagnosed with brain cancer. Without mentioning their names, Trump criticized both McCain and his fellow Arizona Republican, Senator Jeff Flake. Neither McCain nor Flake attended the event. Trump complained repeatedly about the â\\x80\\x9cone voteâ\\x80\\x9d that stopped the Senate from repealing and replacing Obamacare, the signature domestic policy of his predecessor, Barack Obama. â\\x80\\x9cOne vote away. I will not mention any names - very presidential. And nobody wants me to mention your other senator, whoâ\\x80\\x99s weak on border, weak on crime. Nobody knows who the hell he is! See, I havenâ\\x80\\x99t mentioned any names, so now everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s happy,â\\x80\\x9d he said. The White House had said earlier when asked about Arpaio that â\\x80\\x9cthere will be no discussion of that today.â\\x80\\x9d  That did not stop Trump from raising the subject. â\\x80\\x9cDo the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?â\\x80\\x9d Trump asked, sparking loud applause and a chant of â\\x80\\x9cPardon Joe!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWas Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?â\\x80\\x9d Trump asked, before predicting that Arpaio would be just fine. â\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t do it tonight because I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to cause any controversy. But Sheriff Joe can feel good,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Trump drew broad criticism for blaming both white nationalists and counter-protesters for the deadly violence at the Charlottesville rally, which was organized by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. One woman was killed. He mocked left-wing protesters in his speech.

Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, had asked him to postpone Tuesdayâ\\x80\\x99s event while the nation healed from outrage and division after the deadly rally in Charlottesville. A heavy police presence was deployed around the Phoenix venue for Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s first trip as president to Arizona, which he won in the 2016 election. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress said on Thursday that they will soon unveil plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, providing a timeframe for a legislative goal they have struggled with for weeks.     Republicans, who control the White House, the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, have long vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act but have had difficulty agreeing on a detailed plan for replacing the signature domestic policy of former Democratic President Barack Obama. But announcements from Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan claimed progress. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re doing Obamacare, weâ\\x80\\x99re in the final stages,â\\x80\\x9d Trump told a news conference. â\\x80\\x9cSo we will be submitting sometime in early March, mid-March.â\\x80\\x9d Earlier Thursday, Ryan told reporters on Capitol Hill that House Republicans would introduce legislation to repeal and replace Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s program after a 10-day recess that begins on Friday. â\\x80\\x9cAfter the House returns following theÂ\\xa0Presidents Day break, we intend to introduce legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare,â\\x80\\x9d Ryan said at a press conference. Presidents Day is on Monday and the House returns on Feb. 27. Ryan spoke shortly after many House Republicans huddled in a closed session with newly-installed U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price to discuss their options to change the 2010 law. The session was part pep talk and part laying out of talking points that can be delivered to constituents during the recess. A 19-page â\\x80\\x9cpolicy briefâ\\x80\\x9d was distributed to lawmakers, and it included some details of the emerging House Republican healthcare strategy. In the weeks ahead, Republicans intend to repeal the penalties for Obamacareâ\\x80\\x99s mandate requiring individuals to get coverage and employers to provide it, the policy brief said.  The House Republican replacement plan for Obamacare will include an age-based monthly tax credit that Americans who do not get health insurance through their employer can use to buy health insurance and take from job to job, the brief said. House Republicans plan to unwind the expansion of the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor that happened under Obamacare, and eventually cap federal Medicaid payments to states, the document said. And they plan to repeal cuts that Obamacare made in payments to hospitals treating large numbers of uninsured. Lawmakers left the meeting saying there was plenty more work ahead on thorny issues. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said there is â\\x80\\x9ca range of optionsâ\\x80\\x9d for giving states more say over Medicaid. He also said there were options to offset the cost of a Republican plan, such as capping the tax exclusion for employer-based healthcare plans. ',\n",

You know, because Trump has more important shit he should be dealing with like the presidency. Can we agree, Mr. President-elect Trump, that at this stage it would be better for you to simply stop watching SNL?  Lauer asked.  As opposed to watching it and then complaining about it? As we all know, Trump has repeatedly thrown a temper tantrum every time he watches Alec Baldwin s perfect impersonation of him on the longtime comedy skit show.After Baldwin s latest performance, Trump took to Twitter to whine.Just tried watching Saturday Night Live   unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can t get any worse. Sad  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016But Trump refused to answer Lauer s question and proceeded to trash the show instead. There s nothing funny about it,  Trump claimed, even though millions of Americans watch the show because it is hilarious.  The skits are terrible. I like Alec but his imitation of me is terrible. But you can t bring yourself to stop watching it?  Lauer tried again.And this time, Trump made a veiled threat suggesting that he ll try to force Saturday Night Live off the air once he gets into office if the show doesn t stop mocking him. Frankly, the way the show is going now   and when you look at the work they re doing   who knows how long that show s gonna be on? It s a terrible show. Here s the video via YouTube.When Trump talks like this it needs to be taken seriously. Freedom of speech is in serious jeopardy and Trump is actng like a typical dictator who can t handle being the butt of a joke.Former Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi also whined about being the the subject of satire, and that led to Bassem Youssef, who hosted a Daily Show-like political satire program, to be arrested and persecuted. His show was eventually forced off the air. It sounds like Trump is laying the groundwork to do the same to shows that make fun of him.Featured Image: Ty Wright/ Getty Images',\n",
       " 'SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore named a former speaker of parliament as the multicultural city-state s first woman president on Wednesday while critics expressed dismay that other candidates were disqualified and the election went uncontested. Aiming to strengthen a sense of inclusivity, Singapore had decreed the presidency, a largely ceremonial six-year post, would be reserved for candidates from the minority Malay community this time. The returning officer declared Halimah Yacob, 63, elected on Wednesday after nominations closed. Of the four other applicants, two were not Malays and two were not qualified to contest, the elections department said on Monday. Halimah had automatically qualified because she held a senior public post for over three years. If the election had been held, all citizens would have been eligible to vote. Several critics went online to protest against the stringent eligibility rules, which include a stipulation that a candidate from the private sector should have headed a company with paid-up capital of at least S$500 million ($370 million). The prime minister s office said it had no comment on   criticism of the election process.  It would have restored some of the lost moral authority by her winning against credible opponents through popular votes,  said opposition politician Yee Jenn Jong in a blog post.  She is, after all, a veteran in elections and has won handsomely in the four general elections she stood in.  The rights group Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) said it hoped  more will be done to improve access to politics for all of Singapore s women .  Unfortunately, the process that led to this outcome has not reflected our hopes,  it said in a statement posted online. Displays of dissent are rare in Singapore, one of the richest and most politically stable countries in the world. It has been ruled by the People s Action Party (PAP) since independence in 1965 and the current prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, is the son of the country s founding father Lee Kuan Yew. In the 2015 general election   held months after the death of Lee Kuan Yew   the PAP won almost 70 per cent of the popular vote and swept all but six of parliament s 89 seats. The incoming president, who is to be sworn in on Thursday, appeared unfazed by the controversy.  Although this is a reserved election, I m not a reserved president,  Halimah said in a speech at the election nominations office.  I m a president for everyone.  Whether or not there is an election or no election, my promise is to serve everyone and I will serve with great vigor, with a lot of hard work, with the same passion and commitment.  ',\n",

       " 'MOSCOW (Reuters) - A senior official in the Russian parliament will discuss North Korea s missile and nuclear program in separate talks with parliamentarians from Seoul and Pyongyang on Monday, TASS news agency said. Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the Senate upper house, will discuss the issue with a deputy head of North Korea s legislature and the head of South Korea s parliament on the sidelines of a congress of parliamentarians in St Petersburg, TASS quoted a senior Russian lawmaker as saying.  Both meetings will take place on Oct. 16,  TASS cited Konstantin Kosachev, head of the Senate s international relations committee, as saying. Quoting an unnamed source, RIA news agency said earlier on Saturday the meetings would take place on Oct. 15.  I believe that during the meetings the Russian side will call (on North and South Korea) to hold direct contacts. This would be quite natural, but of course we cannot, and should not, force anyone to do so,  Kosachev told TASS. North Korea s nuclear tests and missile launches have stirred global tensions and prompted several rounds of international sanctions at the U.N. Security Council. A de-escalation plan, which is backed by Russia and China,  would see North Korea suspend its ballistic missile program and the United States and South Korea simultaneously call a moratorium on large-scale missile exercises, both moves aimed at paving the way for multilateral talks.

       " ' 21st Century Wire says Now we can see part of the Obama Administration s end game in cooking-up the  Russian Election Hack  Hoax. After much hysteria, followed by hype over the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper s report release this weekend   claiming that Russia and Vladimir Putin altered the results of the 2016 US Elections in favor of winner Donald Trump, what we can see so far, the report contains no evidence at all. The much anticipated report has a number of basic errors, wild assumptions and misinformation. Some critics have labeled Clapper s report beyond a joke.Back on Sept 1, 2016, 21WIRE warned readers that Obama appointee, Jeh Johnson (image, left), head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), was attempting to wrestle control of US election systems away from the 50 States, who have been the guardians of these systems since the founding of the United States, placing the election system instead under the control the federal DHS. On Friday, he actually did it   announcing the he believes this is the right thing to do   and justifies this federal power-grab by carefully inferring that the 2016 elections were  hacked  in a cyber security breach.Despite the fact nearly every state and local body opposed the federal move, the White House and its pretorian DHS tool quietly snuck it through anyway. As Johnson is a lawyer (like most Obama appointees) he was very careful to mince his words, stating that,  cyber attacks on this country are becoming more sophisticated, and bad cyber actors   ranging from nation state.  Lawyerspeak aside, Jeh Johnson is clearly referring to Russia.This incredible decree was issued by DHS head   conveniently under the cover of the DNI s empty Russian Hack  report, and also under the cover of the highly questionable  Active Shooter  drama at Fort Lauderdale Airport on Friday afternoon.For any intelligent person watching, it s hardly a coincidence that President Obama issued such an incredible federal power-grab on a day such as this.Here is Friday s rather pompous statement from Jeh Johnson the US Department of Homeland Security Statement by Secretary Jeh Johnson on the Designation of Election Infrastructure as a Critical Infrastructure SubsectorRelease Date: January 6, 2017 For Immediate Release Office of the Press Secretary Contact: 202-282-8010I have determined that election infrastructure in this country should be designated as a subsector of the existing Government Facilities critical infrastructure sector. Given the vital role elections play in this country, it is clear that certain systems and assets of election infrastructure meet the definition of critical infrastructure, in fact and in law.I have reached this determination so that election infrastructure will, on a more formal and enduring basis, be a priority for cybersecurity assistance and protections that the Department of Homeland Security provides to a range of private and public sector entities. By  election infrastructure,  we mean storage facilities, polling places, and centralized vote tabulations locations used to support the election process, and information and communications technology to include voter registration databases, voting machines, and other systems to manage the election process and report and display results on behalf of state and local governments.Prior to reaching this determination, my staff and I consulted many state and local election officials; I am aware that many of them are opposed to this designation. It is important to stress what this designation does and does not mean. This designation does not mean a federal takeover, regulation, oversight or intrusion concerning elections in this country. This designation does nothing to change the role state and local governments have in administering and running elections.The designation of election infrastructure as critical infrastructure subsector does mean that election infrastructure becomes a priority within the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. It also enables this Department to prioritize our cybersecurity assistance to state and local election officials, but only for those who request it. Further, the designation makes clear both domestically and internationally that election infrastructure enjoys all the benefits and protections of critical infrastructure that the U.S. government has to offer. Finally, a designation makes it easier for the federal government to have full and frank discussions with key stakeholders regarding sensitive vulnerability information.Particularly in these times, this designation is simply the right and obvious thing to do.At present, there are sixteen critical infrastructure sectors, including twenty subsectors that are eligible to receive prioritized cybersecurity assistance from the Department of Homeland Security. The existing critical infrastructure sectors are:Entities within these sectors all benefit from this designation and work with us closely on cybersecurity. For example, we have developed joint cybersecurity exercises with numerous companies within the communications, information technology, financial services and energy sectors to improve our incident response capabilities. We have also streamlined access to unclassified and classified information to critical infrastructure owners and operators in partnership with information sharing and analysis organizations. Moreover, many critical infrastructure sectors include assets and systems owned and operated by state and local governments, such as dams, healthcare and public health, and water and wastewater systems.Now more than ever, it is important that we offer our assistance to state and local election officials in the cybersecurity of their systems. Election infrastructure is vital to our national interests, and cyber attacks on this country are becoming more sophisticated, and bad cyber actors   ranging from nation states, cyber criminals and hacktivists   are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous.Further, our increasingly digital and connected world has reshaped our lives. It has streamlined everyday tasks and changed the way we communicate. But, just as the continually evolving digital age has improved our quality of life, it has also introduced an array of cyber threats and implications.Cybersecurity continues to be a top priority for DHS, as it is for state and local election officials across the country. This designation enables the states, should they request it, to leverage the full scope of cybersecurity services we can make available to them.21WIRE editors note: More context on this story below  LAST-MINUTE POWER GRAB: Jeh Johnson Obama and Biden celebrate another federal power-grab by the DHS.

       " 'As Attorney General, Jeff Sessions is the top law enforcement person in this country. He s also under investigation for colluding with the Russians and for lying about it. Let that sink in for just a moment.There s a new report out on Thursday, which, whether or not it is to be believed, is more bad news for Sessions.According to an article in The Guardian, an American lobbyist for Russian banking and oil interests claims that he had dinner with Sessions. This is in direct conflict to what Sessions claimed in front of the Senate just this week.Sessions testified under oath on Tuesday that he did not believe he had any contacts with lobbyists working for Russian interests over the course of Trump s campaign. But Richard Burt, a former ambassador to Germany during the Reagan administration, who has represented Russian interests in Washington, told the Guardian that he could confirm previous media reports that stated he had contacts with Sessions at the time. I did attend two dinners with groups of former Republican foreign policy officials and Senator Sessions,  Burt said.Burt, who previously served on the advisory board of Alfa Capital Partners, a private equity fund where Russia s Alfa Bank was an investor and last year was lobbying on behalf of a pipeline company that is now controlled by Gazprom, Russia s state-controlled energy conglomerate, first told Politico in October that he had been invited to two dinners that were hosted by Sessions last summer, at the height of the presidential campaign.There are two ways this could play out for Sessions. Either Burt is telling the truth, which is a possible smoking gun for perjury and obstruction, or he s lying. While Republicans seem to be operating under the assumption that Putin is holding them tight in his warm shirtless embrace, the truth is that Putin doesn t give a crap about Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump or Paul Ryan.Russia s goal is to destabilize the United States using the best tools at their disposal, and right now, Republicans are their biggest tools. That will change the moment the idiots prove they re no longer useful. Burt s statement could, even if not true, prove that Session s usefulness is done. Russia could be ready to turn on the Trump administration.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - The largest program of the Clinton Foundation, the family philanthropy of U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, is still weighing whether to continue accepting foreign donations should Clinton be elected, a spokeswoman said on Friday. It was reported on Thursday that the Clinton Foundation would no longer receive donations from foreigners or corporations if Clinton wins the election in November, an effort to defuse criticism that donors to the globe-straddling charity might inappropriately seek White House favors in return. But representatives of the charities confirmed on Friday that the new guidelines would only apply to a small portion of the foundationâ\\x80\\x99s activities, including its work on climate change and some of its work on economic development. The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the foundationâ\\x80\\x99s flagship project credited with reducing the cost of life-saving HIV medicines in the developing world, is yet to decide if it will similarly introduce new limits on donors. â\\x80\\x9cCHAI is a separate legal entity from the Clinton Foundation with its own Board,â\\x80\\x9d Regan Lachapelle, a CHAI spokeswoman, said in an email. â\\x80\\x9cThe CHAI Board will be meeting soon to determine its next steps.â\\x80\\x9d  CHAI accounts for nearly 60 percent of the $250 million the foundation spent in 2014, according to the foundationâ\\x80\\x99s most recent annual report posted on its website. CHAI files separate tax returns from the Clinton Foundation, but is included in the foundationâ\\x80\\x99s audited expenses, annual reports and other promotional literature. Similarly, a Canadian offshoot of the foundation, the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada), or CGEP, will not be bound by the foundationâ\\x80\\x99s donor limits, but said it will instead become an â\\x80\\x9cindependent entityâ\\x80\\x9d if Hillary Clinton becomes president. CGEP, which says Canadian law prevents it from disclosing its donorsâ\\x80\\x99 names without their permission, was founded by Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president, and Canadian businessman Frank Giustra in 2007 to improve work opportunities for people in poor countries.  â\\x80\\x9cIf Secretary Clinton wins the election, we plan to spin CGEP into an independent entity to continue this important work,â\\x80\\x9d Giustra said in a statement. â\\x80\\x9cPresident Clinton and I believe it is important that we continue the work of alleviating poverty around the world.â\\x80\\x9d The statement did not specify Bill Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s future role. A spokesman for Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s campaign declined to answer questions about the foundation. The charities have received praise from public health experts for their work alleviating the spread of HIV, and Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s campaign has said any donor expecting political favors in return would be misguided. The family renamed their foundation the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013, although Hillary Clinton stepped down from her board position last year after announcing her presidential bid. Her husband and daughter remain board members. In 2008, Hillary Clinton signed an ethics agreement governing her familyâ\\x80\\x99s charities in order to become President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s secretary of state. She promised that her familyâ\\x80\\x99s charities would name all their donors on an annual basis and seek clearance from the U.S. State Department before accepting new donations from foreign government money. Last year, the charities said they did not comply with these promises, blaming â\\x80\\x9coversights.â\\x80\\x9d On Tuesday, the Boston Globe said in an editorial that the foundation should shut down. â\\x80\\x9cEven if theyâ\\x80\\x99ve done nothing illegal, the foundation will always look too much like a conflict of interest for comfort,â\\x80\\x9d the editorial board wrote.

       " 'Kellyanne Conway was sent to meet with congressional staffers on Capitol Hill. It didn t go well.Conway and Boris Epshteyn apparently spoke to 100 communications staffers representing Republican senators to tell them what roles they are playing in the government, especially since Conway repeatedly lies for Trump on television and clearly has a lot of power in the White House.During one line of questioning, Conway was asked about the 1.5 million Americans who have called the Congressional switchboard to voice their opposition to Donald Trump s Education nominee Betsy DeVos.Conway responded by saying that she only gives a damn about her own  Real Person Impact  meter and suggested that those 1.5 million Americans are not real human beings because they oppose Trump. She basically said the people jamming up the phones don t matter to this White House,  an attendee told Politico.  That this administration just cares about what matters to  real people. The disdain Conway and Trump have against dissenting Americans is absolutely disgraceful. She is literally saying that it doesn t matter what the American people think and that Republicans should just shove their agenda down ours throats.But Conway wasn t done humiliating herself on Capitol Hill.After ridiculing the concerns of Americans about DeVos, a staffer asked about her reaction to Saturday Night Live s skit featuring Melissa McCarthy as Sean Spicer. A staffer said that her  face turned to stone  and she abruptly ended the meeting and ran away like a coward. They definitely did not find it funny,  the source said.  And then they walked out. The White House later disputed the claim and proceeded to brag about how Conway received an ovation from the staffers, something that did NOT happen.Clearly, Trump and his team are still delusional and believe that everyone loves them and what they are doing when, in fact, the exact opposite is the truth.Seriously, Kellyanne Conway has no business working in the White House and she definitely has no business being interviewed by the media.

       " 'WASHINGTON  â\\x80\\x94   Russian warplanes have carried out airstrikes to support Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s offensive in northern Syria against the Islamic State, an important evolution in a budding   partnership. The deepening ties threaten to marginalize the United States in the struggle to shape Syriaâ\\x80\\x99s ultimate fate. The air missions, which took place for about a week near the strategically important town of Al Bab, represent the Kremlinâ\\x80\\x99s first use of its military might to help the Turks in their fight against the militant group. The Russians seized an opening to try to build a military relationship with Turkey, a NATO member, as the United States has sought to keep the emphasis on taking Raqqa, the Islamic Stateâ\\x80\\x99s   capital. The Russian bombing is a remarkable turnabout from November 2015, when a Turkish   fighter jet shot down a Russian   attack plane that had violated Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s airspace. Russia and Turkey had already been involved in a joint effort to establish a   in Syria  â\\x80\\x94   one that does not involve the United States. At the same time, ties between the United States and Turkey have come under growing strain as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has become increasingly alarmed about the Kurdish forces known as the Y. P. G. The United States has aligned itself with those forces to combat the Islamic State in Syria. Some analysts say Russia appears to have arrived at an accommodation in which the Turks are moving to establish a security zone in northern Syria to preclude Syrian Kurds from setting up an autonomous region. In return, the Turks appear to be backing off their efforts to unseat President Bashar   of Syria, who, with Russian help, is strengthening his hold on the countryâ\\x80\\x99s major cities to the south. â\\x80\\x9cThe   rapprochement is largely tactical,â\\x80\\x9d said James F. Jeffrey, a former United States ambassador to Turkey. â\\x80\\x9cRussia can live for now with a Turkish enclave in northern Syria if it does not threaten the Assad regime. And it allows Russia to exploit the U. S. shift to Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s rival, the Y. P. G. by providing air support to the Turks against the Islamic State, which the U. S. inexplicably is not providing. â\\x80\\x9d   Donald J. Trump has spoken positively, though in vague terms, about the possibility of cooperating with Russia in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. But the Obama administrationâ\\x80\\x99s efforts to forge a common political and military strategy with the Kremlin on Syria collapsed after Russia supported Syrian forces and   fighters with its air power in the brutal retaking of Aleppo. Turkey began the operation at Al Bab, east of Aleppo, without coordinating with the United States and without the benefit of American airstrikes. â\\x80\\x9cThis is something that theyâ\\x80\\x99ve decided to do independently,â\\x80\\x9d Col. John Dorrian, the spokesman for the   operation against the Islamic State, said in November. Turkey appeared to have assumed that it would make short work of the Islamic State fighters there. But the fighting has been stiff. In late November, the Turkish militaryâ\\x80\\x99s problems were compounded when three of its soldiers were killed in what Turkish forces said was a Syrian airstrike. Mr. Erdogan later spoke by phone with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, who assured him that Russia had not been involved in the air attack, according to Turkish news reports. The improving ties between the two autocratic leaders opened the door to greater cooperation. The Turkish military spoke publicly about the Russian role in a Jan. 2 statement that noted that Russian warplanes had struck targets the previous day about five miles south of Al Bab. American officials, who asked not to be identified because they were discussing intelligence, said that Russian airstrikes in the Al Bab area began at the end of December, and that Russian aircraft were flying near Al Bab as recently as Friday. The effectiveness of the Russian air operations, which have mainly involved dropping â\\x80\\x9cdumb,â\\x80\\x9d or unguided, bombs, is unclear. As Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s casualties have mounted in the Al Bab operation, Turkish officials have complained about the lack of American air support and have even made veiled threats that Turkey might suspend allied combat flights against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria from its major base at Incirlik, which would be a major blow to the   air campaign. American officials suggested that the holdup in carrying out allied airstrikes in recent weeks was related to a Turkish decision to ban the Americans from flying reconnaissance drones in and around Al Bab to help identify and confirm targets, as well as bad weather. The Turkish military said that measure was needed to ensure that no potentially hostile aircraft flew over its troops, but it has hampered the United Statesâ\\x80\\x99 ability to carry out airstrikes without endangering civilians. Operating without the benefit of precise intelligence, the United States recently engaged in what officials called a â\\x80\\x9cshow of forceâ\\x80\\x9d operation in which American aircraft flew low over Al Bab and dropped flares. But last week, the Turks agreed that the United States could fly drones and other aircraft to gather intelligence, which paves the way for the   coalition to carry out airstrikes against the Islamic State in Al Bab, American officials said. The United States regards the Kurdish forces as some of the most effective fighters in the campaign against the Islamic State in Syria. But in deference to Turkish sensitivities, the Americans have declined to arm them directly. The Turks, however, regard them as nothing more than an arm of the Kurdistan Workersâ\\x80\\x99 Party, an insurgent Kurdish group in Turkey and Iraq. The Turks have blamed the group for killing dozens of Turkish security forces in recent weeks. By any measure, the nascent cooperation between Russia and Turkey is a striking development. The situation was far different when Russian warplanes arrived at Latakia, Syria, in September 2015 to help the Assad government take on rebel groups, including some backed by the United States and Turkey. Relations were thrown into a crisis after a Turkish fighter jet shot down a Russian   attack plane and the Russian pilot was fatally shot by Syrian rebels as he was parachuting down. Mr. Putin denounced the   as a â\\x80\\x9cstab in the back. â\\x80\\x9d Russia responded by deploying the   an advanced   system, at Latakia, and imposed economic sanctions against Turkey. But over the past year, the calculations of the two countries have changed. While President Obama warned that Syria would become a Russian military â\\x80\\x9cquagmire,â\\x80\\x9d the Russians, working with Iran,   forces and the Syrian military, helped Mr. Assad take back Aleppo in the waning months of the Obama administration without substantial Russian casualties. Still, Russia has to reckon with the fact that the Syrian military lacks the troops to control all of the country. At the same time, Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s immediate objectives have shifted. Worried about the possibility that Kurdish fighters might link up separate cantons to establish an autonomous enclave across northern Syria, as well as about the presence of Islamic State fighters near its borders, Turkey sent its own forces into northern Syria in August. The Turkish offensive, which has enlisted the support of Syrian opposition groups that Turkey has backed, succeeded in taking the town of Jarabulus. But it has become bogged down near Al Bab, the last major town west of Raqqa still held by the Islamic State. The Russians notified the United States about the flights using a special hotline between Russian forces in Syria and the American air war command at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

It is, indeed, the elite leadership of both political parties that appears to have provoked this realignment in US politics towards outsiders and those not embroiled in what many see as a corrupt and broken system.Bernie Sanders, the Democratic outsider, also shocked the world with a victory over Hillary Clinton last night.Just two weeks ago Cruz and Kasich were publicising that they had made a deal to stop Trump, yet even their combined efforts were useless.Yesterday, a Rasmussen poll emerged showing that Donald Trump can indeed beat Hillary Clinton at the general election, and that scenario is looking ever more likely with the political establishment in such dramatic retreat.It is possible that Bernie voters will not support Hillary in the general election, and in many ways their anti-establishment position gels much better with the politics of Trump than it does with Wall Street insider Clinton.Immediately after Kasich s announcement today, #DropOutHillary began trending on Twitter. At the time of writing it is the number two trending hashtag in the US with 102,000 tweets.With such an immediate response taking aim at another establishment figure, the chances of Trump, or perhaps even Sanders, taking the presidency seem higher than ever.GET THE FULL STORY ON THE ELECTION: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump s Attorney General just got schooled on the Constitution.Earlier this week, Jeff Sessions bitched about a judge  on an island in the Pacific  having the power to block an executive order. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power,  Sessions said.Of course, Sessions is a hypocrite because he cheered on judges who blocked executive orders issued by President Obama.But because the order was issued by his rich white boss, Sessions is all of a sudden complaining.Judge Derrick Watson stood up to Trump and his racist administration a couple months ago by blocking parts of the immigration ban that barred Muslims from certain nations from entering the country. Trump s ban caused international chaos and violated the civil rights of thousands.Hawaii is not merely an  island in the Pacific,  however. It s also an official state under the same Constitution that Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump violate on a daily basis.In the Constitution, the founding fathers created the Judicial Branch of our government to serve as a check on executive and legislative power. The judiciary has the power to review executive orders and laws and can block and strike them down if they are found to be unconstitutional.Judge Watson exercised his judicial power.Sessions  statement is a disgraceful attempt to undermine the judicial branch.Hawaii Attorney General Dougal Chin fired back at Sessions on Thursday by explaining how the Constitution works. President Trump previously called a federal judge in California a so-called judge. Now U.S. Attorney General Sessions appears to dismiss a federal judge in Hawaii as just a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific. Our Constitution created a separation of powers in the United States for a reason. Our federal courts, established under Article III of the Constitution, are co-equal partners with Congress and the President. It is disappointing Sessions does not acknowledge that. Indeed, America needs an Attorney General who actually understands the Constitution, and Sessions clearly does not.One of Sessions  Justice Department lackeys even tried to pathetically clarify the offensive remarks. Hawaii is, in fact, an island in the Pacific a beautiful one where the Attorney General s granddaughter was born. The point, however, is that there is a problem when a flawed opinion by a single judge can block the President s lawful exercise of authority to keep the entire country safe. Wrong. If Trump and his administration think the ruling is flawed then they should seek opinions from higher courts. That s how the system works. The White House and Justice Department can t just ignore a court ruling because they disagree with it. Also, national security should not be used as an excuse to ignore the Constitution. That s a slippery slope to tyranny. If that excuse were acceptable Trump and Sessions would use it all the time to justify anything and everything they do.Jeff Sessions should be embarrassed for attacking the judicial branch the way he did and he definitely deserved the humiliation he has been receiving. Frankly, he should resign in disgrace.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images',\n",

Three young men from North Africa were arrested on Saturday in the western German city of Dortmund for stoning two transgender women.According to a report on Friday on television station SAT1.NRW, the men attacked Yasmine und Elisa, two transgender women, near the city s main train station. Within seconds we were tossed around and they took stones from a gravel bed on the corner and threw them at us,  said Elisa.A police car appeared at the train station as the stoning attack unfolded and arrested the men.The German media as a general rule do not disclose the last names of victims to protect their privacy. The three men are between 16 and 18 years-old and are known to the authorities from theft and assault arrests.Dortmund police official Kim-Ben Freigang said the suspects told the police that  such persons must be stoned. Yasmine installed a security camera at the residence where she lives with Elisa after the attacks.  That was barbaric what they did. They are barbarians,  Yasmine said.She added that she could not believe that such an act of shamelessness occurred.  In 2016, in Germany, with stoning!  According to the SATI.NRW report, Yasmine said it was the first time in 30 years she felt unsafe as a transgender woman.According to Yasmine and Elisa, the three young men propositioned them, but after they realized that Yasmine and Elisa are transgender women, they attacked them with stones.Stoning people to death is a penalty used in nine Muslim-majority countries. In November, a criminal court in Iran s northern province of Gilan sentenced a woman to be executed by stoning for alleged complicity in the murder of her husband, Arash Babaieepour Tabrizinejad.

       " 'This story is for anyone who believes the government is capable of basic addition. Even though this news is out there for everyone to see, the Left continues to use this crisis as an opportunity to try to pin the gross negligence of the EPA on the Republican Governor of Michigan. Flint, MI is a Democrat ruled, crime ridden, poverty stricken hell-hole. Stay tuned for the  environmental injustice  narrative Obama will soon be pushing. He s just waiting for the right time to demand federal funds be funneled into Democrat ruled, failing cities across America you know, to prevent further environmental crises. We all know #BlackLivesMatter would have already been there if someone was able to pin this on the rich, white Republican Governor of MI The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency s top Midwest official said her department knew as early as April about the lack of corrosion controls in Flint s water supply   a situation that likely put residents at risk for lead contamination   but said her hands were tied in bringing the information to the public.Starting with inquiries made in February, the federal agency battled Michigan s Department of Environmental Quality behind the scenes for at least six months over whether Flint needed to use chemical treatments to keep lead lines and plumbing connections from leaching into drinking water. The EPA did not publicize its concern that Flint residents  health was jeopardized by the state s insistence that such controls were not required by law.Instead of moving quickly to verify the concerns or take preventative measures, federal officials opted to prod the DEQ to act, EPA Region 5 Administrator Susan Hedman told The Detroit News this week. Hedman said she sought a legal opinion on whether the EPA could force action, but it wasn t completed until November.The state didn t agree to apply corrosion controls until late July and didn t publicly concede until October that it erroneously applied the federal Lead and Copper Rule overseeing water quality.An EPA water expert, Miguel Del Toral, identified potential problems with Flint s drinking water in February, confirmed the suspicions in April and summarized the looming problem in a June internal memo. The state decided in October to change Flint s drinking water source from the corrosive Flint River back to the Detroit water system.Critics have charged Hedman with attempting to keep the memo s information in-house and downplaying its significance.As soon as the lack of corrosion controls became apparent, state and federal officials should have acted to protect the public, said Virginia Tech researcher Marc Edwards, whose water analysis in 2015 helped uncover Flint s lead contamination. At that point, you do not just have smoke, you have a three-alarm fire and should respond immediately,  said Edwards, who, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, has obtained dozens of key documents related to Flint s crisis through public record requests.  There was no sense of urgency at any of the relevant agencies, with the obvious exception of Miguel Del Toral, and he was silenced and discredited. About five months after being alerted to the lack of corrosion controls, a researcher at Hurley Medical Center in Flint began in August detecting high levels of lead in the bloodwork of city children. Lead poisoning can cause learning disabilities and, at high levels, may lead to seizures, coma and death, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Hedman defended her agency s handling of the Flint water situation, saying her water quality staff repeatedly worked to convince the DEQ that corrosion controls were needed   to no avail. Let s be clear, the recommendation to DEQ (regarding the need for corrosion controls) occurred at higher and higher levels during this time period,  Hedman said in a Detroit News interview.  And the answer kept coming back from DEQ that  no, we are not going to make a decision until after we see more testing results.   Michigan Governor Rick Snyder announced yesterday that 10 people have died from Legionnaire s disease in Flint, Mich. Eighty-seven cases of Legionnaire s disease have been found in and around Flint in the past 18 months.Flint s long-running water problems with drinking water have shaken Michigan s government, leading to last month s resignation of DEQ Director Dan Wyant and last week s state declaration of an emergency in the city. An independent task force appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder to review the situation placed the bulk of the blame for Flint s crisis on the DEQ.The federal government s actions are worth exploring, said Chris Kolb, co-chairman of the task force. We have made a request to speak with a number of EPA employees,  said Kolb, president of the Michigan Environmental Council and a former Democratic state representative.Flint s water crisis gained a national profile in the past week, as President Barack Obama s chief of staff said Sunday the White House is  very concerned  and is monitoring the situation  very closely.  Former Obama Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a Democratic presidential hopeful, called on the administration Tuesday to  step up  with assistance for Flint as well as do an  expedited review  of the city s water infrastructure.DEQ-EPA battleDEQ and EPA staffers were at loggerheads over dueling interpretations of the Lead and Copper Rule   a 25-year-old regulation designed to protect drinking water from metals contamination. The interpretation of the rule proved to be crucial after the city   under Snyder-appointed emergency managers   switched from Lake Huron water provided by the Detroit system to Flint River water as a cost-saving move in the spring of 2014.Following the switch, DEQ officials argued water testing, including two six-month periods of sampling, needed to be completed before making a decision on the need for corrosion controls. EPA officials, according to Hedman, wanted the controls implemented immediately out of concern for public health.If they knew Flint s lack of corrosion measures would likely result in lead reaching the drinking water   by June, testing would show it had   why didn t EPA officials inform the public when the DEQ failed to act?Hedman said federal law clearly lays out the state and federal responsibilities in overseeing safe drinking water. The EPA s role is to establish treatment standards and monitoring techniques, and provide technical assistance, she said. The state acts as the primary regulator of water operations. It is important to understand the clear roles here,  Hedman said.  Communication about lead in drinking water and the health impacts associated with that, that s the role of DHHS, the county health department and the drinking water utility. In addition, EPA officials argue that there wasn t sufficient early evidence for any sweeping steps to be taken.Hedman said the EPA talked with its legal counsel about its authority to compel action   a question that wouldn t be straightened out for months. In the interim, she said her agency urged Michigan to have its Department of Health and Human Services provide information on precautions for residents.EPA s lack of urgencyBut critics such as Edwards contend Hedman acted with no urgency, even behind the scenes. A week after the June 24 memo was circulated, an email exchange between Hedman and then-Flint Mayor Dayne Walling showed no sense of alarm over the threat to public health and more concern about procedure. The preliminary draft report should not have been released outside the agency,  Hedman wrote in the July 1 email.  When the report has been revised and fully vetted by EPA management, the findings and recommendations will be shared with the city and DEQ will be responsible for following up with the city. The revised and vetted memo was released four months later   in November. Edwards has described Del Toral s original memo as  100 percent accurate  in its assessment of the looming problem.Flint s drinking water ills led to the resignations last month of both Wyant and DEQ spokesman Brad Wurfel. It also caused the October reassignment of Liane Shekter Smith, then chief of DEQ s Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance. The crisis prompted Snyder to switch Flint back over to the Detroit water system in mid-October until a new regional water authority using Lake Huron as its source is completed later this year.Despite all of the moves, officials warn that unfiltered Flint water is still not safe to drink.There has been no fallout for federal environmental officials. There s been a failure at all levels to accurately assess the scale of the public health crisis in Flint, and that problem is ongoing,  said state Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich, D-Flint.  However, the EPA s Miguel Del Toral did excellent work in trying to expose this disaster. Anyone who read his memo and failed to act should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Congressman Dan Kildee, D-Flint Township, stressed that the lion s share of responsibility for Flint s situation lies with the state DEQ.Yet he has questions about how the Lead and Copper Rule   ostensibly a safeguard for the public   may have contributed to EPA s response. If changes are necessary, he wants them made. There is a legitimate concern about EPA s performance in terms of alerting the public,  Kildee said.  And frankly, as a member of Congress, I want to know when there s the potential of a health crisis in my district.   Via: The Detroit News',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch said on Wednesday presidents must obey court orders and expressed uncertainty about language in the Constitution barring U.S. government officials from taking payments from a foreign country as Democrats grilled him on issues involving President Donald Trump. Gorsuch, the conservative appeals court judge from Colorado nominated by Trump on Jan. 31 to a lifetime job on the nationâ\\x80\\x99s highest court, sparred with Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats on the third day of his confirmation hearing.  He completed his testimony on Wednesday night. The committee will complete its deliberations on Thursday by hearing testimony from outside witnesses. Gorsuch seems assured of winning committee approval, moving his nomination to the full Republican-led Senate. His challenge then would be to gather enough Democratic votes to avoid a prolonged floor fight with the potential, if it gets rocky, of changing how the Senate works. While Gorsuchâ\\x80\\x99s confirmation process looked to be proceeding smoothly, Democrats pressed him on matters swirling around Trump, even asking him about the standards for impeachment. Gorsuchâ\\x80\\x99s expected Senate confirmation would restore a conservative majority on the court and hand the Republican president his biggest achievement in office. Senator Patrick Leahy cited comments by Trump adviser Stephen Miller after courts blocked the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s executive action temporarily banning people from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. On Feb. 12, Miller challenged the authority of courts to rule on the issue, saying the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s power to enforce the ban should not be questioned. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m a judge now. I take that seriously. And you better believe I expect judicial decrees to be obeyed,â\\x80\\x9d Gorsuch said. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the rule of law in this country,â\\x80\\x9d Gorsuch added. Gorsuch declined to say how he would approach an alleged violation of the U.S. Constitutionâ\\x80\\x99s Emoluments Clause, which prevents American officials from accepting any gifts or favors from foreign governments without congressional approval. â\\x80\\x9cThe question is: What exactly does that mean?â\\x80\\x9d Gorsuch said, noting there was ongoing litigation on the matter. â\\x80\\x9cI have to be very careful about expressing any views.â\\x80\\x9d Trump has been sued by ethics lawyers, who say his businesses have accepted payments from foreign governments in violation of the Emoluments Clause. On the basis for which an official can be impeached, Gorsuch said historically the focus had been on â\\x80\\x9chigh crimesâ\\x80\\x9d rather than â\\x80\\x9cmisdemeanors.â\\x80\\x9d He said the number of criminal misdemeanors on the books had increased substantially since the U.S. Constitution was written in the 18th century.  A unanimous ruling on Wednesday by the Supreme Court justices whom Gorsuch would join, if confirmed, rejected legal reasoning he used as an appellate judge in a 2008 ruling against an autistic child who sought a public education more tailored to his needs. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of another autistic student who argued he was denied an adequate education. Democrats have called Gorsuchâ\\x80\\x99s earlier decision an example of how he rules against everyday Americans while favoring corporate interests, an assertion the nominee and his Republicans supporters reject. Gorsuch said he was bound by court precedent in the 2008 decision, adding it would be â\\x80\\x9cheartbreakingâ\\x80\\x9d to suggest he would like ruling against disabled students. He sidestepped answering whether he thought a series of contentious past cases had been decided correctly, including those on abortion, gun rights, political spending and religious rights. â\\x80\\x9cWhat worries me is you have been very much able to avoid any specificity, like no one I have every seen before,â\\x80\\x9d Senator Dianne Feinstein, the panelâ\\x80\\x99s top Democrat, told Gorsuch.  Feinstein asked Gorsuch to explain a document dating from his work in former President George W. Bushâ\\x80\\x99s Justice Department related to 2005 anti-torture restrictions. The document asked whether aggressive interrogation techniques used by Bushâ\\x80\\x99s administration had yielded valuable intelligence or stopped a terrorist incident, and Gorsuch had written â\\x80\\x9cyes.â\\x80\\x9d Gorsuch said he was merely doing what he was told by the administration. â\\x80\\x9cMy recollection of 12 years ago is that was the position that the clients were telling us,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Feinstein expressed concern about womenâ\\x80\\x99s rights and preserving legalized abortion, and asked Gorsuch about his views as an â\\x80\\x9coriginalistâ\\x80\\x9d seeing the Constitutionâ\\x80\\x99s meaning as unaltered since its enactment despite centuries of societal change. â\\x80\\x9cNo one is looking to return us to horse-and-buggy days,â\\x80\\x9d Gorsuch said. Regarding the Constitutionâ\\x80\\x99s promise of equal protection under the law, Gorsuch said it did not matter that some of the drafters of the language â\\x80\\x9cwere racists, because they were, or sexists, because they were.â\\x80\\x9d Republicans hold 52 seats in the 100-member Senate. The Senate has a 60-vote hurdle for confirmation of Supreme Court justices, meaning Gorsuch would need backing by eight Democrats. If Democrats stand together, Republicans could change Senate rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority vote. A committee vote is expected on April 3. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Gorsuch would be confirmed before lawmakersâ\\x80\\x99 mid-April recess. If confirmed, Gorsuch would replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016.  ',\n",
       " 'In August 2016, the announcement of the discovery of a terrestrial exoplanet orbiting in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri (artists impression above) stimulated the imagination of experts and the general public. This star is the nearest star to our sun, though it is 10 times less massive and 500 times less luminous. This discovery, together with the discovery in May 2016 of a similar planet orbiting an even lower-mass star (Trappist-1), convinced astronomers that such red dwarfs (as these low-mass stars are called) might be hosts to a large population of Earth-like planets.\\nComputer simulations of the formation of planets orbiting in the habitable zones of low mass stars such as Proxima Centauri by astrophysicists at the University of Bern show that these planets are most likely to be roughly the size of the Earth and to contain large amounts of water.What might these objects look like? What could they be made of? Yann Alibert and Willy Benz at the Swiss NCCR PlanetS and the Center of Space and Habitability (CSH) at the University of Bern carried out the first computer simulations of the formation of planets expected to orbit stars 10 times less massive than the sun.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOur models succeed in reproducing planets that are similar in terms of mass and period to the ones observed recently,â\\x80\\x9d Alibert says regarding the results of the study, forthcoming as a letter in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. â\\x80\\x9cInterestingly, we find that planets in close-in orbits around these type of stars are of small sizes. Typically, they range between 0.5 and 1.5 Earth radii with a peak at about 1.0 Earth radius. Future discoveries will tell if we are correct,â\\x80\\x9d the researcher adds.\\nIn addition, the astrophysicists determined the water content of the planets orbiting their small host stars in the habitable zone. They found that around 90 percent of the planets harbour more than 10 percent water. For comparison, the Earth has a fraction of water of only about .02 percent. The situation could be even more extreme if the protoplanetary disks in which these planets form persist longer than assumed in the models. In any case, these planets would be covered by very deep oceans at the bottom of which, owing to enormous pressure, water would be in form of ice.\\nWater is required for life as we know it. So could these planets be habitable? â\\x80\\x9cWhile liquid water is generally thought to be an essential ingredient, too much of a good thing may be bad,â\\x80\\x9d says Willy Benz. In previous studies, the scientists in Bern showed that too much water may prevent the regulation of the surface temperature and destabilize the climate. â\\x80\\x9cBut this is the case for the Earth; here, we deal with considerably more exotic planets that might be subjected to a much harsher radiation environment, and/or be synchronous,â\\x80\\x9d he adds.\\nTo start their calculations, the scientists considered a series of a few hundreds to thousands of identical, low-mass stars, and around each of them, a protoplanetary disk of dust and gas. Planets are formed by accretion of this material. Alibert and Benz assumed that at the beginning, there were 10 planetary embryos in each disk with an initial mass equal to the mass of the moon. In a few dayâ\\x80\\x99s computer time for each system, the model calculated how these randomly located embryos grew and migrated. What kind of planets are formed depends on the structure and evolution of the protoplanetary disks.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHabitable or not, the study of planets orbiting very low-mass stars will likely bring exciting new results, improving our knowledge of planet formation, evolution, and potential habitability,â\\x80\\x9d summarizes Benz. Because these stars are considerably less luminous than the sun, planets can be much closer to their stars before the surface temperature becomes too high for liquid water to exist. Considering that this type of star also represents the overwhelming majority of stars in the solar neighbourhood and that close-in planets are presently easier to detect and study, it is easy to understand why the existence of this population of Earth-like planets is of importance.\\nThe Daily Galaxy via University of Bern \\nSource: Daily Galaxy \\n',\n",

Itâ\\x80\\x99s another day of both bonds and stocks trading lower which makes perfect sense as its contra to the last 7 years where bonds and stocks rallied together (and the same trend from 1981 to 2000)â\\x80¦   company Doug Casey, Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that already has a staggering 18.1 million ounces of gold that just added another massive deposit and is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest gold opportunities   \\nWe can continue to analyze earnings and the economic fundamentals every which way to try to figure out where stocks go but letâ\\x80\\x99s be honest, itâ\\x80\\x99s all about where rates go in the monetary world we live in. The German 10 yr bund is up 5 bps to .08% which would be a closing 4 month high. The 10 yr Gilt yield is breaking out by 6 bps to 1.15%, the highest since the day of the UK vote. The French 10 yr yield is up by 5 bps and the Italian 10 yr yield is higher by 6 bps to also a 4 month high. I canâ\\x80\\x99t blame bond weakness in Asia as yields there were little changed. The US 10 yr is getting dragged up to 1.77-1.78%, testing yesterdayâ\\x80\\x99s intraday high. The US 2 yr yield is up by 1.5 bps to .87%, the highest since early June on the heels of the weak 2 yr note auction yesterday. \\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll reiterate the factors in our bearish case for bonds: \\n1) In a bond world dominated by central banks, damaged bank profitability in Japan and Europe has the BoJ and ECB acknowledging their monetary limits with NIRP and curve flattening. \\n2) The BoJ and ECB are also running out of bonds to buy. \\n3) Starving pension funds, savers and insurance companies of yield is gaining fodder for political pushback against central bankers, especially from politicians in Europe including in the UK. \\n4) Mark Carney and Janet Yellen admit that theyâ\\x80\\x99re willing to tolerate higher inflation at the same time inflation stats are moving higher. \\n5) With core inflation sticky due to gains in services, commodity prices ending their 5 yr bear market (I believe) will continue to shift headline inflation higher in coming months and quarters. CRB raw industrials index is just shy of a 16 month high and energy prices are all up y/o/y. \\n6) Atlanta Fed wage growth tracker is at its highest level since January â\\x80\\x9909. \\n7) Foreigners are aggressive net sellers of US notes and bonds, $180b year to date. \\n8) Even without fiscal stimulus, the US budget deficit is expected to gap higher in coming years. Also of importanceâ\\x80¦ \\nAnd here is a portion of todayâ\\x80\\x99s note from Art Cashin: Overnight And Overseas â\\x80\\x93 In Asia, markets were a bit mixed. Japan was up a smidge, but Hong Kong and India got dinged smartly. Shanghai saw more moderate losses. \\nIn Europe, stocks are generally lower as crude continues to trade below $50 and Apple is getting beat up a bit after their earnings report. \\nIn other assets, the euro rallied a bit against the dollar. Crude trades near $49.25 and gold is down a shade. \\nConsensus â\\x80\\x93 The Apple fallout weighs on the equity futures. Crude will be followed closely and could have a big influence if it breaks below $49. If equity selling turns intense, traders will watch the S&P 2130 level.

She s representing a former FBI informant who has evidence on kickbacks and bribery involving the transportation of uranium in the US. She recently told Sean Hannity her client will brief Congress about Russian involvement in the U.S. uranium market. This includes widespread bribery and actions that involved the Clintons https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDVndQRW22Q I m not going into detail,  attorney Victoria Toensing said on the Oct. 24 Hannity.  You know that, Sean. But the informant will give an overview and specific conversations that he had with Russians in what they were thinking about the money that they were spending. I mean, let me just be that general and it involves the Clintons. The director of the FBI at that time was Robert Mueller, and he is now the special counsel investigating alleged Russian collusion with the 2016 Trump campaign. The undercover investigation involving Toensing s client occurred between 2009 and 2014, and the senior attorney on the case was Rod Rosenstein, who is now the deputy attorney general of the United States and the official who appointed Mueller as special counsel.Further, all this information indicates that many senior Obama administration officials knew about instances of bribery and money laundering involving at least one Russian official, at a time when Russia wanted to expand its uranium market in the United States, and when the administration through a special committee had to approve or deny the sale of a company, Vancouver-based Uranium One, to Rosatom. (Rosatom is the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation.)Some of the people on that Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States included then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Attorney General Eric Holder, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napalitano, and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.The committee approved the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom in October 2010. That sale gave Russia, and President Vladimir Putin, control over 20% of U.S. uranium production. (At least nine investors in Uranium One   prior to, during, and after that sale   donated $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.) So, Mueller, [Rod] Rosenstein, maybe even [James] Comey at the time, and the president of the United States   certainly Eric Holder was the head of the DOJ   they all knew that they had all this evidence that the Russians had infiltrated with the purpose of a criminal enterprise to corner the market on uranium, the foundational material of nuclear weapons?  asked Hannity.Toensing said,  That is correct.

       " 'The members of the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce had broken their fasts and left the mosque near Floridaâ\\x80\\x99s eastern shoreline. In the waning minutes of Sunday, less than an hour later, a surveillance camera recorded a man as he approached the mosque. Then came a flash as flames damaged the house of worship where the man who attacked an Orlando, Fla. nightclub often prayed. The authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were investigating the fire as a potential hate crime, even as officials cautioned that they remained uncertain about the motive. The blaze occurred on the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and nearly three months after Omar Mateen opened fire at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. It also happened around the beginning of Eid   a Muslim holiday. â\\x80\\x9cToday was supposed to be a day of this community exchanging gifts with their kids, visiting their family members, having dinners, having lunches,â\\x80\\x9d Wilfredo Ruiz, a spokesman for the mosque, said at a Monday afternoon news conference in Fort Pierce, Fla. â\\x80\\x9cInstead, they needed to go to another place to worship. â\\x80\\x9d No one was injured in the attack, and the St. Lucie County Sheriffâ\\x80\\x99s Office sought help identifying the suspect, whom the authorities described as a white or Hispanic male. Video showed the man arriving at the mosque, which is in a former Presbyterian church, about 11:38 p. m. on Sunday, appearing to carry paper and a bottle of some type of liquid. The camera recorded a flash, presumably when the fire ignited, and the man waved his arms, perhaps from a burn, before he fled on a motorcycle. Officials refused to speculate about a connection between the fire and the anniversary of the terrorist attack. A spokesman for the Sheriffâ\\x80\\x99s Office, Bryan Beaty, declined to discuss whether Mr. Mateenâ\\x80\\x99s ties to the mosque might have prompted the fire. With its painted star and crescent, palm trees and occasional protester outside, the Sunni mosque is central to Islamic life in Fort Pierce, a city of around 44, 000 people about an hourâ\\x80\\x99s drive north of Palm Beach. Yet it has also been a hub of controversy, drawing attention twice in recent years as a place where young men who staged attacks had worshiped. In addition to Mr. Mateen, who was killed during the siege at Pulse, which left 49 other people dead, the Islamic Center was a frequent stop for Moner Mohammad Abusalha, who carried out a 2014 suicide bombing in Syria. (The F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, said the men had known each other â\\x80\\x9ccasually. â\\x80\\x9d) In June, the Islamic Centerâ\\x80\\x99s imam, Syed Shafeeq Rahman, distanced himself and the mosque from Mr. Mateen and, more generally, from extremist ideology. â\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing that he is hearing from me to do killing, to do bloodshed, to do anything, because we never talk like that,â\\x80\\x9d the imam said of Mr. Mateen. The mosque, like many in the United States, has expressed concerns about security and the commitment of the local authorities to protect its members and property. Tensions mounted in July after the authorities arrested a    man they said had repeatedly punched someone who had been at the Islamic Center to pray. The case is pending in the local circuit court, where a prosecutor said in a filing last month that the accused man had â\\x80\\x9cevidenced prejudiceâ\\x80\\x9d during the attack. Mr. Beaty said deputies had also investigated two suspicious vehicles and a harassing phone call at the mosque since the June 12 attack in Orlando. The fire at the Islamic Center is at least the third suspected arson at a Florida mosque this summer. A Tampa mosque was targeted twice in less than 24 hours last month, and a spokesman for the cityâ\\x80\\x99s Fire Department, Jason A. Penny, said Monday that the inquiry there remained active. In Fort Pierce on Monday, people responded to the attack with a mix of outrage and sadness. â\\x80\\x9cAn attack on any house of worship is an attack on all houses of worship,â\\x80\\x9d said Ahmed Bedier, a Muslim activist in Florida. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s unacceptable. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Doug Jones won a bitter fight for a U.S. Senate seat in deeply conservative Alabama on Tuesday, dealing a political blow to President Donald Trump in a race marked by sexual misconduct accusations against Republican candidate Roy Moore. KEY POINTS:    The stunning upset makes Jones the first Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate from Alabama in a quarter-century and will trim the Republicansâ\\x80\\x99 already narrow Senate majority to 51-49, opening the door for Democrats to possibly retake the chamber in next yearâ\\x80\\x99s congressional elections.     PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST AT FIRST STANDARD FINANCIAL IN NEW YORK:  â\\x80\\x9cIf anything it prompts Congress to get the tax bill signed before year end and they have another week. If they donâ\\x80\\x99t they do have a problem.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cFrom that perspective yesterdayâ\\x80\\x99s defeat is good news in terms of tax legislation. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re not going to risk tax reform because of the election. While itâ\\x80\\x99s a defeat itâ\\x80\\x99s actually a positive.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf the President doesnâ\\x80\\x99t sign legislation by year end we have a major problem. That would just speed up the process of a correction. Would it affect the economy, reverse the economic growth? Not in 2018, perhaps in 2019.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt was a defeat for the Republican Party and Mr. Trump but it also motivates the Republicans to get their act together and get a bill signed.â\\x80\\x9d KEITH LERNER, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, SUNTRUST ADVISORY SERVICES IN ATLANTA, GA: â\\x80\\x9cTax reform is still likely to go through. What happened overnight may present an obstacle to the GOP agenda in 2018, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s arguably less important than tax reform. Perhaps there will be some obstacles to infrastructure, entitlement reform. But from a market perspective, those werenâ\\x80\\x99t high-probability anyway. â\\x80\\x9cThe high probability is (tax) gets through. The Republicans have tried to fast-track it before (Jones) gets seated, so itâ\\x80\\x99s unlikely his victory will change that. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll have a short-term setback (if the tax bill doesnâ\\x80\\x99t pass), and it may cap the upside of the market since companies wonâ\\x80\\x99t be getting an earnings boost. But if thereâ\\x80\\x99s a pullback, I think it will be in the 5 to 10 percent range, as opposed to a bear market. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s still early, but there looks certainly to be big changes in the midterm with the makeup of the House and Senate.  â\\x80\\x9cAs long as the economy is on sound footing, gridlock in Washington is not necessarily a bad thing. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not necessarily preferable, but with the majority so slim as it is, itâ\\x80\\x99s more of a question, does the economy chug along? If the economy continues to move forward, itâ\\x80\\x99s less important.â\\x80\\x9d  GENNADIY GOLDBERG, INTEREST RATES STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK: â\\x80\\x9cWe think one of the possible biggest impact is on the deficit. With the Jones win, it makes it more difficult to pass the tax-cut bill. â\\x80\\x9cThis puts pressure on the Republicans to pass tax cuts before year-end. The question is can they do it? Are we going to see special provisions or deals to get it done. I think itâ\\x80\\x99s a â\\x80\\x98get it doneâ\\x80\\x99 mentality. If not, it does bleed into early 2018. â\\x80\\x9cIt lowers the odds of getting anything done in 2018.â\\x80\\x9d Â\\xa0 L. THOMAS BLOCK, FUNDSTRAT GLOBAL ADVISORS, WASHINGTON POLICY STRATEGY (from research note):  â\\x80\\x9cBottom line is that the Alabama Senate race doesnâ\\x80\\x99t change the basic (Washington) DC headlines, first that tax bill should pass by Christmas, and that there are tough negotiations ahead to solve the budget issues and avoid a government shutdown.â\\x80\\x9d  MARC CHANDLER, GLOBAL HEAD OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN (from research note): â\\x80\\x9c(The dollar) did slip to the low for the week against the yen, when it became clear that the Republicans were going to lose the Senate seat in Alabama. This reduced the Republican majority to one in the Senate.

George Martin, 50, had strapped a snowplow to his sport utility vehicle and planned to spend the day using it to scrape up a few dollars. He expected seven inches. His spirits sank when he woke up extra early and looked outside. â\\x80\\x9cLike, oh man, come on, they did it again,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s like having a firecracker and you throw it and itâ\\x80\\x99s a dud. â\\x80\\x9d He added, â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing to plow. You canâ\\x80\\x99t charge people for something thatâ\\x80\\x99s not there. â\\x80\\x9d Al Clark, 38, and Stephen Vierschilling, 26,   at a shop that paints fire engines, shared jokes about weather forecasters. â\\x80\\x9cThe last few storms they said it was going to be Armageddon and it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Clark said. Soo Becchina, a   special education teacher from Oceanside on Long Island, tutors students after school four days a week. Because of the storm, she had to cancel sessions with her students. The missed day means missed wages. â\\x80\\x9cTutoring is a side business for me,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Becchina said. â\\x80\\x9cBut, more important it always upsets me when I cannot give my kids what they need. One of the girls I see is having a math test tomorrow. I am hoping that the teacher doesnâ\\x80\\x99t give the test but, I know this teacher and she normally doesnâ\\x80\\x99t move test dates. â\\x80\\x9d Despite losing the day and the money, Ms. Becchina still plans on doing a phone session with her student later in the day, at no charge.  â\\x80\\x94   NATE SCHWEBER and RUTH BASHINSKY Cancellation notices covered the international flight board at Terminal 4 at Kennedy Airport in Queens on Tuesday morning. But one flight, from Guangzhou, China, had landed shortly before 5 a. m. David Dubois, an engineer and   aviation enthusiast from Hudson, N. H. was among the passengers. He said he was impressed with the planeâ\\x80\\x99s landing, despite the snowy conditions. â\\x80\\x9cThe pilot really had a difficult time and pulled it off really well,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Dubois said. â\\x80\\x9cThere was no tarmac it was all snow. When he landed, you could just feel it starting to go sideways. He pulled it straight  â\\x80\\x94   no bounce, no nothing. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe it. â\\x80\\x9d But Mr. Dubois still had to get to New England. Kamari Simon, 18, was in a similar bind in Terminal 5. Mr. Simon, a D. J. said he was scheduled to perform with a    rapper named Smooky Margiela at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. â\\x80\\x9cI hope everything goes through and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be down in Austin,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Simon, who studies music at Five Towns College in Dix Hills, on Long Island. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s an opportunity for me to meet other artists and network. â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   SEAN PICCOLI Tuesdayâ\\x80\\x99s storm shuttered schools along the Eastern Seaboard, keeping students out of the classroom. But, even though school was closed, elementary students in Petersham, Mass. a town of 1, 200 in the central part of the state, did not exactly have a snow day. Instead, they had homework  â\\x80\\x94   books, activities, worksheets and even a science experiment  â\\x80\\x94   intended to allow them to make up the day of school without being there, and, thus, to prevent the school from having to add a day at the end of the year. The idea emerged after the winter of 2015, when the district had 10 snow days. Tari Thomas, the superintendent of schools for a consolidated school district that includes Petersham, said the district experimented with sending older students home with online coursework to complete on laptops (although that was not the case on Tuesday, because the students had already used up the five days of online learning they were allowed for the year). â\\x80\\x9cThere have been a small pocket of parents that have said, â\\x80\\x98Why canâ\\x80\\x99t kids be kids and have a snow day? â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Thomas. But, Ms. Thomas added, â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve had parents say, â\\x80\\x98Oh my gosh, thank goodness you gave them something to do. â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d In Central Park in Manhattan, it was a different story. It was a true snow day with schools canceled. Aliana Lambert, 6, dragged her purple sled to a   hill. There was no written rule banning girls from the hill at 100th Street and Central Park West, but at 2 p. m. Aliana was the only girl standing. Kat Vlasica, Alianaâ\\x80\\x99s mother, said they came to their neighborhood hill for every snowstorm. â\\x80\\x9cWhen youâ\\x80\\x99re in New York with 800 square feet, you have to take advantage of a hill like this,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cThis is our hill, and we donâ\\x80\\x99t even have to salt or scrape it. â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   JESS BIDGOOD and EMILY PALMER Navigating New York City streets was a challenge, what with snow and sleet and gusting wind and patches of ice. Drivers on Staten Island confronted another obstacle: a pair of runaway ponies. Terence Monahan, the chief of patrol, said the two ponies escaped from a stable. An   police officer driving his truck saw them walking down Hylan Boulevard on the South Shore. The officer stopped and grabbed a tow strap from inside his truck. â\\x80\\x9cHe grabbed them, tied them to a lamp post. We got a radio car there and we were able to return them back to the stables,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re safe, theyâ\\x80\\x99re in great shape. â\\x80\\x9d The mayor, for his part, thanked the â\\x80\\x9ccowboy officer. â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   ASHLEY SOUTHALL WASHINGTON  â\\x80\\x94   Washington is finally getting the snow day it thought this winter had forgotten  â\\x80\\x94   well, kind of. Never mind that only an inch or two of snow, sleet and freezing rain fell across the city and nearby swaths of Virginia and Maryland overnight. Or that public transportation and the federal government, the regionâ\\x80\\x99s largest employer, were open for business. As layers of snow and sleet buried crocuses and wilted Washingtonâ\\x80\\x99s early cherry blossoms, the roads were unplowed and mostly empty at dawn on Tuesday. Business owners who decided to open anyway shoveled front walks only to see them recoated in slippery slush. Even lawmakers in the House of Representatives, who are racing to move major health care legislation forward this week, elected to give themselves something of a snow day on Tuesday. Citing the rash of canceled flights across the country, they postponed all votes until Wednesday. Inside the Oval Office, President Trump hosted Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabiaâ\\x80\\x99s deputy crown prince, for lunch and a  . Outside, the daily steady shuffle of tourists posed for pictures. David and Michelle Wilding of Dallas were among them, accompanied by their daughters, Hope and Grace. They had imagined something of a greener spring getaway. So snow? â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s wonderful,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Wilding said, especially after a winter at home that did not send its usual dose.  â\\x80\\x94   NICHOLAS FANDOS The snowstorm threw a wrench into Town Meeting Day, a   pillar of the local democratic process in New Hampshire. With the jury out on what, exactly, elections officials were allowed to do, some town moderators postponed the    votes that make up the backbone of governance here. Others let them go ahead, and voters navigated wind and snow to make it to the polls. â\\x80\\x9cWe had to instruct our voter clerks to tell the voters, please donâ\\x80\\x99t drip on the ballots,â\\x80\\x9d said Wayne Colby, the town moderator in Henniker, N. H. west of Concord. â\\x80\\x9cI grew up in New Hampshire,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Colby said, adding, â\\x80\\x9cWe donâ\\x80\\x99t have snow days for elections. â\\x80\\x9d The town meeting, where voters hash out the budget or other issues related to fire and police departments, is older than the state itself. It is also a day of voting for local offices, ordinance changes or bonds. When it became clear that the day would collide with a major winter storm, some town moderators wondered if they could postpone their votes and meetings. The answer from the governor? Itâ\\x80\\x99s not clear, but please donâ\\x80\\x99t. â\\x80\\x9cGiven that there are differing opinions, the best we can do is strongly recommend that all towns stay open for voting tomorrow,â\\x80\\x9d said Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican.

       " 'PARIS (Reuters) - Nissan is halting joint development of luxury cars with Daimlerâ\\x80\\x99s Mercedes-Benz, sources close to the companies told Reuters, suspending a key project in their seven-year partnership and potentially hitting profitability at a new shared factory in Mexico. Nissan (7201.T) decided in October its premium Infiniti brand would not use â\\x80\\x9cMFA2â\\x80\\x9d, an upgraded Daimler (DAIGn.DE) car platform that the companies have jointly funded, in part because Infiniti was not performing well enough to absorb Mercedes technology costs, the sources said. â\\x80\\x9cIt wasnâ\\x80\\x99t possible to close a deal on the basis of MFA2,â\\x80\\x9d said one of the people. â\\x80\\x9cThe targets set by Infiniti were too difficult to achieve.â\\x80\\x9d The move could reduce efficiency at a $1 billion shared factory opening this year in Aguascalientes, Mexico, where the companies had planned to use the same compact car architecture to cut complexity and production costs, two of the sources said. It could also ultimately force Nissan to write down part of a 250 million pound ($306 million) investment at its UK plant that included Mercedes-based tooling, they added. Daimler and Nissan pursue joint programs only when â\\x80\\x9cbeneficial for both sidesâ\\x80\\x9d, the companies said in separate statements to Reuters, without directly addressing emailed questions about their plans for MFA2 vehicles. Projects are constantly reviewed against targets to account for â\\x80\\x9cdevelopments beyond the control of managementâ\\x80\\x9d, they added, and discussions about joint development of future premium compact cars are ongoing.  Nissanâ\\x80\\x99s decision deals a blow to the broad cooperation deal struck between Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn and his Daimler counterpart Dieter Zetsche in 2010. It also underscores the mixed results of Nissanâ\\x80\\x99s battle over almost three decades to transform Infiniti into a significant global player in the lucrative luxury car market. The decision predates Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s election as the next U.S. president, the sources said, and was unrelated to campaign vows to penalize Mexican imports that have rattled the auto industry. Ford (F.N) on Tuesday scrapped a planned compact car plant in the country. Nissan and Daimler are pushing ahead with Aguascalientes, where they will build Infiniti and Mercedes models for the U.S. and other markets from a single assembly line opening in 2017. The project nonetheless faces weakening U.S. demand for smaller cars that contributed to Fordâ\\x80\\x99s cancellation and has further raised profitability hurdles for new Infiniti compacts. Persistently low oil prices accelerated the market shift to larger vehicles in 2016, Ford sales chief Mark LaNeve said on Wednesday. â\\x80\\x9cAll the growth was SUVs and trucks.â\\x80\\x9d Infiniti has struggled outside the United States, last year selling 16,000 vehicles in Western Europe and 230,000 globally - less than 5 percent of Nissanâ\\x80\\x99s overall tally and barely one-tenth of Mercedesâ\\x80\\x99s expected 2 million deliveries. The first Infiniti appeared in 1989, the same year as the launch model for Toyotaâ\\x80\\x99s (7203.T) upscale Lexus brand - which has since grown three times bigger by sales. Modern carmakers pursue economies of scale by increasing the number of models built on each underlying platform - an adaptable chassis accommodating different body sizes, engines and alternative component sets for every part of the vehicle. The retreat on luxury compacts leaves intact the sharing of engines between Infiniti and Mercedes, and small cars between Renault and Daimlerâ\\x80\\x99s Smart. The three groups also collaborate on vans and pickups. But joint premium car development for Mexican production was â\\x80\\x9cone of the largest projects between the Renault-Nissan alliance and Daimlerâ\\x80\\x9d, Ghosn said when unveiling the program in 2014. A year later, after upgrading its plant in Sunderland, England, Nissan began building the Infiniti Q30 hatchback on the current MFA architecture developed for the Mercedes A-Class and derivatives. The plant added the QX30 SUV in 2016, extending Infinitiâ\\x80\\x99s push into smaller vehicles. Nissan has now ditched plans to use the updated Mercedes platform for successors to those models planned for Aguascalientes, the sources said - or for any future Infinitis. Other cancellations include a compact Mercedes-based Infiniti Q40 sedan earmarked for the plant in 2018. Instead the single, less efficient assembly line will build Mercedes cars including an A-Class sedan and subsequent mini-SUV alongside Infiniti vehicles based on Renault-Nissan architecture, starting with a new QX50 SUV this year. Nissan was forced to conclude that the Infiniti brand would not command the higher prices required to turn a profit on vehicles stuffed with Mercedes technology, one source explained.  â\\x80\\x9cOne of the lessons learned is that if you have the costs of a luxury vehicle but not the pricing, itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to be profitable,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Nissan may end up writing down some Sunderland investment in Mercedes-based tooling that had been intended to outlast the current Q30 and QX30, people with knowledge of the matter said.  The company is still paying its share of MFA2 development costs running to hundreds of millions of euros for a platform it no longer plans to use, they said, but will leave Daimler with a higher share of some production costs in Aguascalientes. The setback may also show the limits of Ghosnâ\\x80\\x99s consensual approach to economies of scale as head of both Renault (RENA.PA) and Nissan, whose 18-year-old alliance is underpinned by significant cross-shareholdings. The slow pace of integration has contributed to upheaval at the recently created alliance powertrain division, charged with  converging Renault and Nissan engineering. Plans to build Infinitis on Mercedes technology had encountered resistance at Nissan from the start, one source said. â\\x80\\x9cOnce again, Ghosn has been unable to break through the wall of engineers to force commonality.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",

While Airbnb is likely the biggest company in that niche market, the Los Angeles Times points out that there are other vacation rental companies that would be affected. Right now, residents can rent out their apartment or home for 90 days in a year. Proposition F would limit that rental period to 75 days. The measure is viewed as an attempt to discourage people from taking units off the housing market and using them as short-term apartment rentals.

       " 'European Union (EU) countries which constructed border fences in response to the migrant crisis have seen a collapse in illegal migration, while unprotected states have seen it increase. [Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, reported drastic falls in illegal immigration for countries which have constructed border defences in its Risk Analysis for 2017.  Hungary, which led the charge on strong borders, was able to cut illegal crossings from Serbia to 25, 000  â\\x80\\x94   a massive drop from the 2015 high of 200, 000. Neighbouring Croatia condemned Hungaryâ\\x80\\x99s robust stance at the time, with then Prime Minister Zoran MilanoviÄ\\x87 promising his country would not follow suit. â\\x80\\x9cWe are ready to accept and direct those people,â\\x80\\x9d he said, adding that â\\x80\\x9cbarbed wire in Europe in the 21st century is not an answer, itâ\\x80\\x99s a threatâ\\x80\\x9d. Just days later, however, MilanoviÄ\\x87 completely reversed his stance, the country having been inundated with thousands of migrants. â\\x80\\x9cWe cannot register and accommodate these people any longer,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThey will get food, water and medical help, and then they can move on. The European Union must know that Croatia will not become a migrant â\\x80\\x98hotspotâ\\x80\\x99. We have hearts, but we also have heads. â\\x80\\x9d Croatia quietly joined Hungary in constructing what Frontex describes as â\\x80\\x9ca technical obstacleâ\\x80\\x9d along its Serbian border. As a consequence, illegal migration via this route plummetted from 500, 000 in 2015 to just 100, 000 in 2016. The clear pattern which emerges from the risk analysis is that, as one country institutes strong border controls, neighbouring countries which remain lax see a corresponding increase in illegal migration. For example, the report describes how â\\x80\\x9cAfrican illegal stayers who primarily entered the EU through the Central Mediterranean route significantly decreased in Austriaâ\\x80\\x9d after the   country â\\x80\\x9cupgraded the controls of its national border with Italyâ\\x80\\x9d. The statistics show illegal stayers growing in Switzerland, which is outside the EU but inside the blocâ\\x80\\x99s borderless Schengen zone, â\\x80\\x9cat the same timeâ\\x80\\x9d. Despite clear statistical evidence of the effectiveness of walls in tackling illegal migration, Europeâ\\x80\\x99s leading politicians remain wedded to open borders. Federica Mogherini, the EUâ\\x80\\x99s unelected High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security, has insisted that â\\x80\\x9cwe have a history and a tradition and an identity based on the fact that we celebrate when walls are broken down and bridges are builtâ\\x80\\x9d. Her statement was seen as a   swipe at U. S. President Donald J. Trump, and was reiterated by the blocâ\\x80\\x99s Trade Commissioner earlier on Wednesday. The German foreign minister, whose country has absorbed millions of unvetted illegal migrants at a cost of over 20 billion euros and suffered terror attacks as a result, has also told the president that â\\x80\\x9cbuilding walls is a bad ideaâ\\x80\\x9d. Surveys suggest that a majority of European voters do in fact wish to severely curtail immigration, particularly from the Islamic world.',\n",

       " '21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE has previously reported, if there is no real terrorist threat, then the thing to do is to create one. Such is the received wisdom of today s Federal Bureau of Investigation.Last summer, the FBI admitted in its July 2016 public relations release from the agency s counter terrorism  department, plans to  significantly increase its borderline illegal use of stings in order to catch what it claims are  would-be terrorists.  This amounts to an all-to-familiar dubious practice of using entrapment   used to organize, recruit, train and even supply materials to prospective neophyte terrorists in the US.Despite this dysfunctional policy of creating  bad guys  to catch otherwise innocent guys, the agency is soldiering on with other creative, psychometric street side tests to blanket-profile as many Americans as possible in the endless War on Terror  Indy100( ) For the past year-and-a-half the FBI have allegedly been using a 48 question survey to determine if someone is a threat, and one of the questions includes whether the target likes to go camping or not.The document, published by The Intercept, is known as the the  Indicators of Mobilization to Violence  (IMV) survey, and assigns points on factors such as religious observance, travel history, financial transactions, and physical appearance.It s like a Facebook quiz, but terrifying.There are, of course, logical and rational questions you would expect to find on a survey of this kind.Question 1 asks simply:Has the subject mobilised? (E.g. has the subject travelled, attempted to travel overseas to participate in violence; has the subject been arrested in a terrorism charge; or has the subject conducted a terrorist attack?Question 20 asks:Is the subject a regular consumer of extremist propaganda?And question 31 asks:Has the subject sought or received direct guidance from overseas extremists?However, there are a number of questions in there that seem obtuse and in many cases, appear far too broad to truly be affective in identifying someone with extremist views.Question 2 enquires:Does [the] subject possess or have immediate access to weapons?Americans own an estimated 265 million guns.

       " 'In 2013, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid used the  nuclear option  to call for a vote to change the rules of the Senate with a simple majority. His call won 52-48, with only three Democrats voting in opposition to the rule change that eliminated the ability to filibuster any presidential nominees except the United States Supreme Court.  This is the way it has to be,  Reid said. Former President Barack Obama supported Reid s rule change, citing that Republicans used the filibuster more often than the historical average in order to prevent confirmation of his nominees.Watch Democrats explain why they need the  nuclear option  is necessary:  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed revenge and hoped to recoup a majority in the Senate in the upcoming 2014 elections, which they successfully did. Reid s decision proved to bear short term benefits for Democrats; it set the precedent for McConnell to apply the same option to push through President Donald Trump s nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch.  The ObserverThanks to all of you who encouraged me to consider filibuster reform. It had to be done.  Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) November 21, 2013McConnell recently promised not to kill the filibuster for legislation, though Politico reported he  argued that using the nuclear option to confirm Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch later this week merely restores what had been the custom in the Senate before a war over judicial nominations flared up during the George W. Bush administration.  The nuclear option was averted in 2005 over several of Bush s court picks, but Reid s use of it in 2013 allowed several of Trump s nominees to barely get confirmation in the Senate with a simple majority. Now, Republicans used the power to change the rules again to apply this simple majority rule to the Supreme Court nomination.',\n",
       " 'Donald J. Trump lashed out on Tuesday in the aftermath of a disappointing first debate with Hillary Clinton, scolding the moderator, criticizing a beauty pageant winner for her physique and raising the prospect of an   attack on Bill Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s marital infidelities in the final stretch of the campaign. Having worked assiduously in recent weeks to cultivate a more disciplined demeanor on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump cast aside that approach on Tuesday morning. As Mrs. Clinton embarked on an ebullient campaign swing through North Carolina, aiming to press her newfound advantage, Mr. Trump vented his grievances in full public view. Sounding weary and impatient as he called into a Fox News program, Mr. Trump criticized Lester Holt, the NBC News anchor, for asking â\\x80\\x9cunfair questionsâ\\x80\\x9d during the debate Monday evening, and speculated that someone might have tampered with his microphone. Mr. Trump repeated his charge that Mrs. Clinton lacked the â\\x80\\x9cstaminaâ\\x80\\x9d to be president, a claim critics have described as sexist, and suggested that in the future he might raise Mr. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s past indiscretions. Defying conventions of political civility, Mr. Trump leveled cutting criticism at a beauty pageant winner, Alicia Machado, whom Mrs. Clinton held up in Monday nightâ\\x80\\x99s debate as an example of Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s disrespect for women. Mr. Trump said on Fox he was right to disparage the former Miss Universe because of her weight. â\\x80\\x9cShe was the winner and she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Trump, who was the pageantâ\\x80\\x99s executive producer at the time. Mrs. Clinton has already been broadcasting an ad highlighting crude remarks from Mr. Trump about women she answered his taunts about her marriage with a rhetorical shrug, telling reporters Mr. Trump was free to run whatever kind of campaign he preferred. On board her campaign plane, she plainly relished her moment of apparent triumph, and poked fun at Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s morning lamentations. â\\x80\\x9cAnybody who complains about the microphone,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cis not having a good night. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s setback in the debate represents a critical test in the final six weeks of the race. Having drawn closer to Mrs. Clinton in the polls, Mr. Trump now faces an intensified clash over his personal temperament and his attitudes toward women and minorities  â\\x80\\x94   areas of grave concern for many voters that were at the center of the candidatesâ\\x80\\x99 confrontation on Monday. Against Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s brooding, Mrs. Clinton cut a strikingly different profile on the campaign trail on Tuesday, emerging emboldened from her encounter with the Republican nominee. At a rally in Raleigh, N. C. Mrs. Clinton, brandishing her opponentâ\\x80\\x99s debate stumbles, assailed Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s comments suggesting he avoided paying taxes and welcomed the 2008 financial crisis as a buying opportunity. â\\x80\\x9cWhat kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes?â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Clinton asked the crowd. â\\x80\\x9cOne who should never be president, is the answer to that question. â\\x80\\x9d Having shaken at least temporarily the malaise of the past month, Mrs. Clinton must seek to gain a durable upper hand over Mr. Trump, who before the debate had been delivering a more focused message on trade, immigration and national security. Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s comportment on Tuesday threatened to undermine his gains of the past month, and recalled his practice during the Republican primaries and much of the general election of belittling political bystanders in language that alienated voters, like attacking the Muslim parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq and a Hispanic federal judge. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will approach the remainder of the race with the unfiltered abandon of his comments Tuesday morning. By the dayâ\\x80\\x99s end, Mr. Trump had returned to a caustic but somewhat more conventional script, attacking Mrs. Clinton in bitter language at a rally in Melbourne, Fla. Blasting Mrs. Clinton as a â\\x80\\x9cvessel for her friends, the donors,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump exhorted the crowd, â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re going to get rid of that crooked woman. â\\x80\\x9d And Mr. Trump again complained at the event about how he had been treated by Mr. Holt, whom he referred to as â\\x80\\x9cthe M. C. â\\x80\\x9d The fear among Republicans is that Mr. Trump will confront adversity by continuing to swing impulsively at politically inopportune targets, dragging the party again into needless and damaging feuds, as he did for most of the summer. The notion of raising Mr. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s infidelity is particularly controversial among Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s advisers, who have sent conflicting signals about that line of attack. Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign manager, said in a CNN interview that he deserved credit for holding back from that particular subject, saying Mr. Trump had been â\\x80\\x9cpolite and a gentleman. â\\x80\\x9d But Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and a close confidant of Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s, called for a far harsher approach. Mr. Trump, he told a reporter for the website Elite Daily, had been â\\x80\\x9ctoo reservedâ\\x80\\x9d in his confrontation with Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Giuliani recommended attacking Mrs. Clinton for having questioned Monica Lewinskyâ\\x80\\x99s credibility in claiming an affair with Mr. Clinton. He also called Mrs. Clinton â\\x80\\x9ctoo stupid to be president. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Giuliani has his own complex marital history: He is on his third marriage as mayor, he surprised his second wife by announcing his plans to separate from her at a news conference. Should Mr. Trump follow the path prescribed by Mr. Giuliani, it could transform the final six weeks of his candidacy into an onslaught of unrestricted personal vituperation  â\\x80\\x94   a risky course that would probably please Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s political base at the cost of his broader appeal. But Democrats signaled on Tuesday that they would welcome an extended battle with Mr. Trump over matters of temperament and personal character. Priorities USA Action, a â\\x80\\x9csuper PACâ\\x80\\x9d supporting Mrs. Clinton, released a television ad highlighting a debate exchange in which Mr. Trump said his temperament was his â\\x80\\x9cstrongest asset,â\\x80\\x9d along with clips of Mr. Trump using obscene and violent language. And Mrs. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, said in a television interview that Mr. Trump had appeared â\\x80\\x9cflusteredâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cran out of gas. â\\x80\\x9d During a campaign stop in Orlando, Fla. Mr. Kaine suggested that Mr. Trump was too unsteady for the White House. â\\x80\\x9cIf youâ\\x80\\x99re that rattled in a debate,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9ctry being president. â\\x80\\x9d Still, among Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s core voters, there is clearly an appetite for blunter and more personal attacks on Mrs. Clinton, and at his rally in Florida, several said they hoped Mr. Trump would be harsher in the next debate. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m glad he was a gentleman,â\\x80\\x9d said Fran Hadjilogiou, 75, of Indian Harbour Beach. â\\x80\\x9cHe should just go get her next time. â\\x80\\x9d Jim Clapper, 66, of Palm Bay, said he hoped Mr. Trump would bring up Mr. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s infidelity â\\x80\\x9cevery chance he gets. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHe ought to bring it up every day so that the young people in this country know what went on with that family,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Clapper said.',\n",
       " 'Amateur president Donald Trump used his commencement speech at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy on Wednesday to make the day all about him. Trump did not address the scandals which have inundated the White House directly, but indirectly he did by saying that he s receiving unfair treatment by the media. Even though Trump s scandals have been compared to Watergate, he said,  Look at the way I ve been treated lately. Especially by the media. Trump whined that no politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly. Apparently, the former reality show star has forgotten how he treated Barack Obama, dogging our first black president for years with baseless allegations saying that he s a scary Muslim from Kenya.Trump gave the cadets some advice, saying that they will need to  fight, fight, fight. Over the course of your life, you will find that things are not always fair. You will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve and that are not always warranted,  he said, seemingly referring to bombshell reports, which he even admitted to on Twitter, saying he disclosed highly classified information to top Russian officials. Or he could be referring to the other bombshell reports, stating that he asked former FBI Director James Comey to shut down an investigation into his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn.Trump went on to brag that he s  accomplished a tremendous amount in a very short time. Then he boasted of his upcoming first international trip which is to begin on Friday. As you leave this academy to embark on your exciting new voyage,  Trump said,  I am heading on a very crucial journey, as well. In a few days, I will make my first trip abroad as President. Things will work out just fine,  Trump concluded.  Great honor. Good luck. Enjoy your life. Watch:Poor Trump, the media has treated him so unfairly by quoting him verbatim. When Flynn was forced to resign, he called the disgraced retired General a  wonderful  man then went on to blame the  fake media. Tell me if this sounds familiar. Michael Flynn, Gen. Flynn, is a wonderful man. I think he has been treated very, very unfairly by the media, as I call it, the fake media in many cases,  Trump said at the time.  And I think it s really a sad thing that he was treated so badly.

The Onion ran a story with the following headline:  Moderator Reminds Vice Presidential Debate Audience To Remain Silent When Exiting Early.  It was already assumed that this debate wouldn t have nearly the spirit of the presidential debates, but The Onion took it nine steps further with this  quote  from the moderator, Elaine Quijano: It s crucial that you stay in a single-file line and make sure to keep moving in an orderly fashion so the aisles are clear for others attempting to leave their seats. And please abstain from slamming the door so as not to disturb those audience members who are sleeping.  [emphasis mine] The Daily Show s  live feed included a picture of a glass of milk with a tie, and some toast with a tie:The allusion is to milquetoast, which refers to a 1920s comic book character, Caspar Milquetoast, who was timid, and now is a general reference to people who are meek or timid. Accompanying that image was audio from the actual debate. It s also an illustration that the VP candidates do seem to remain in the background of each campaign.The general expectation was a very boring debate and both of these demonstrate that expectation very well.

       " '(Reuters) - More than 2.6 million people tuned into cable TV or went online to hear dramatic audio-only coverage of a federal appeals court hearing on U.S. President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees. For more than an hour, people around the United States listened to arguments from attorneys for the U.S. government and Washington state, which sued to challenge Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s executive order imposing the ban. For those using their TVs to hear the coverage, there were also simple graphics and photos. Others listened to streaming online audio. The three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco pressed the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s attorney on the lawfulness of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Jan. 27 order, which triggered chaos and protests at U.S. airports and oversea. The order barred travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days. It banned refugees from Syria indefinitely.  The Republican president, who took office on Jan. 20, has defended the measure as necessary to protect Americans. Critics said it discriminated against Muslims and violated the U.S. Constitution. Last Friday, a federal judge in Seattle suspended the executive order. Many travelers who had been waylaid by the ban quickly moved to travel to the United States while it was in limbo.  The government appealed the decision, and the San Francisco judges heard arguments in the case on Tuesday night.  All three major U.S. cable news networks aired either parts of or the entire hearing, which ran from 6 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. EST. Only the audio was available because the hearing was conducted via conference call.  More than 2.5 million people combined tuned in on CNN or MSNBC, while another 3 million listened to segments of the hearing on Fox News, according to Nielsen data provided by Fox News. As many as 137,000 people listened to the courtâ\\x80\\x99s live feed of the session, said David Madden, assistant circuit executive for the 9th Circuit.  The lack of visuals did not scare away those interested - and even led some to liken the experience to huddling around a radio in the pre-TV era. â\\x80\\x9c@CNN this is television gold. Reminds me of when I was grounded and had to listen to the radio. #WAvTrump #9thCircuit,â\\x80\\x9d Jon Eekhoff (@joneekhoff) said on Twitter. Madden was surprised by the amount of interest in the hearing, â\\x80\\x9cbut I think the court was prepared for it,â\\x80\\x9d he said by email.  As lawyers grappled with questions from the judges, law experts and academics, including Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe, provided the kind of play-by-play commentary generally reserved for major sporting events.  The ability of the public to listen to the hearings was particularly important given Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s questioning of the judges as â\\x80\\x9cso politicalâ\\x80\\x9d and the hearing as â\\x80\\x9cdisgraceful,â\\x80\\x9d Tribe said. â\\x80\\x9cIt was a moment for an important kind of civic education and public engagement in the process of government,â\\x80\\x9d Tribe said.

       " 'BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s government will issue a new decree changing the country s definition of slavery following an earlier order that was widely criticized as a reversal in the fight against forced labor, a presidential aide said on Friday. In Brazil, forced labor has been defined as a form of modern-day slavery. This includes debt bondage, degrading work conditions, and long work hours that pose a risk to a worker s health or life, and violate their dignity. Human rights campaigners said a decree issued by the labor ministry on Monday changed the way slavery was defined, limiting it to a victim s freedom of movement but disregarding other abuses. The new decree, sought by Brazil s powerful farm lobby, would derail enforcement efforts that have freed 50,000 workers from slavery-like conditions since 1995, according to federal prosecutors and labor inspectors.  Responding to the criticism, President Michel Temer said on Friday the decree would be modified but not revoked.  In an interview with the Poder360 news website, Temer said the measure would be  perfected  with suggestions by prosecutors, among them the creation of a police department for slave labor crimes. A presidential aide later said the suggestions would be used to reissue a new decree.  The president instructed the labor minister to study them and see which can be incorporated in a new decree,  the spokesman said. Rights groups estimate hundreds of thousands of people work in slave-like conditions on farms, sugar cane plantations and cattle ranches across Brazil s remote and jungle areas, as well as in urban factories and construction sites. The government decree as issued would close 506 of 706 working conditions cases under investigation, which would no longer be considered slave labor, a spokesman for Brazil s federal prosecutors office said. Temer bowed to pressure from the farm lobby to modify the decree at a time when he is relying on the group s votes in Congress to block corruption charges next week. The farm lobby praised the decree for clarifying the definition of slave labor and eliminating  excesses  by inspectors. Temer told Poder360 the decree needed changing because it contained irrelevant details for defining slavery, such as the need for a soap bar holder or a ladder to a top bunk in workers  sleeping quarters.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration would virtually eliminate federal funding for the Environmental Protection Agencyâ\\x80\\x99s budget for vehicle emissions and fuel economy testing but will seek to raise fees on industry to pay for some testing, a government document shows. The cuts would slash by more than half the staff of the EPA department that conducts vehicle, engine, and fuel testing to verify emissions standards are met and mileage stickers are accurate. Its work helped lead to Volkswagen AGâ\\x80\\x99s (VOWG_p.DE) 2015 admission that it violated vehicle emissions rules for years.     In a March 21 budget document posted online by the Washington Post, the Trump administration proposed eliminating $48 million in federal funding for EPA vehicle and fuel testing and certification. It represents a 99 percent federal cut to the vehicle testing budget and would require â\\x80\\x9cpretty much shutting down the testing lab,â\\x80\\x9d said Margo Oge, who headed the EPAâ\\x80\\x99s Office of Transportation and Air Quality under President Barack Obama. The proposal, which would also cut 168 out of 304 full-time jobs, seeks to partially fund current operations by boosting fees automakers and engine manufacturers pay for testing. An EPA official confirmed the documentâ\\x80\\x99s authenticity.     The Trump administration has proposed cutting the EPAâ\\x80\\x99s budget by 31 percent and eliminating more than 50 programs. EPA spokesman John Konkus declined to answer questions about how the cuts could affect vehicle testing. â\\x80\\x9cWe know we can effectively serve the taxpayers and protect the environment. While many in Washington insist on greater spending, EPA is focused on greater value and real results,â\\x80\\x9d Konkus said. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an auto trade association, said automakers were concerned the proposed cuts could delay certification of new vehicles â\\x80\\x9cand getting products to consumers.â\\x80\\x9d Janet McCabe, a former EPA official in the Obama administration, said Monday that companies that take care to comply with the rules can be at a disadvantage without strong enforcement of the rules. â\\x80\\x9cWe know that a little bit of cheating can mean a lot of air pollution,â\\x80\\x9d McCabe said. The administration plans to release a detailed budget plan in May.  In March, Trump ordered a review of tough U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards put in place by the Obama administration. The EPA stepped up scrutiny of automakers after Volkswagen admitted to cheating diesel emissions tests in 580,000 U.S. vehicles. VW agreed to pay up to $25 billion in penalties and buyback costs and pleaded guilty in March to felony charges. In September 2015, EPA said it would review emissions from all U.S. diesel vehicles after Volkswagenâ\\x80\\x99s admission it used secret software to emit up to 40 times allowable emissions.     That review prompted the allegation by the EPA in January that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV used undisclosed software to allow excess diesel emissions from 104,000 U.S. trucks and SUVs. Fiat Chrysler denies wrongdoing.     The EPA is also scrutinizing emissions from Daimler AGâ\\x80\\x99s Mercedes-Benz vehicles. It has not approved Daimler or Fiat Chryslerâ\\x80\\x99s request to sell 2017 model diesels.     The EPA has also investigated cases of several automakers overstating mileage on window stickers in recent years. In 2014, the EPA hit Korean automakers Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Motors Corp with $350 million in penalties for overstating fuel economy ratings. ',\n",
       " 'Last night, congressional Republicans went after healthcare for low-income kids and loans for low-income students. Through inaction, they killed the Children s Health Insurance Program, a stunningly successful program that has dropped the uninsured rate among low-income children massively over the two decades it has been active. CHIP has ensured that nine million children were insured who otherwise would not be   and Republicans just let it expire.Here s more from the Los Angeles Times:Advocates for children s health started worrying months ago that congressional incompetence would jeopardize the nation s one indisputable healthcare success   the Children s Health Insurance Program, which has reduced the uninsured rate among kids to 5% from 14% over the two decades of its existence.Their fears turned out to be true. Funding for CHIP runs out on Saturday, and no vote on reestablishing the program s $15-billion appropriation is expected for at least a week, probably longer. That s the case even though CHIP is one of the few federal programs that has enjoyed unalloyed bipartisan support since its inception in 1997. The consequences will be dire in many states, which will have to curtail or even shut down their children s health programs until funding is restored. Hanging in the balance is care for 9 million children and pregnant women in low-income households.What happened? The simple answer is that congressional Republicans  last harebrained attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act got in the way. A funding bill for CHIP seemed to be well on its way to enactment until a week or so ago. That s when the effort to pass the egregious Cassidy-Graham repeal bill sucked all the air out of the legislative room.This is obviously an unacceptable situation, and Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) isn t taking it laying down.

       " 'KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan legislators voted late on Wednesday to amend the country s constitution to allow 73-year-old leader Yoweri Museveni to extend his rule, potentially guaranteeing him a life-time presidency.  A provision in the current constitution limits the age of a presidential candidate at 75 years, which would have made Museveni ineligible to stand at the next polls in 2021. At the end of Wednesday s day-long House debate, which capped a protracted and violence-marred process to remove that age limit, MPs voted 315-62 in favor of the amendment.   The bill passes,  said speaker Rebecca Kadaga after announcing tally results, prompting raucous celebrations from the mostly ruling party MPs who favored the bill.  Earlier in the day, two lawmakers were dragged away and detained when they tried to enter parliament, as the divisive debate proceeded in the chamber. Police had blocked some legislators from entering the building, and live television footage showed two of them being driven away in security vehicles. Both opposed the bill. The legislators blocked by police were attempting to enter parliament to serve court documents on House speaker Rebecca Kadaga, who was presiding over the debate. The document called on her to appear in court at 2:00 PM in respect of  the irregular suspension of our members of parliament,  independent lawmaker Wilfred Niwagaba told a local television station minutes before he was detained.  Six MPs - all opposed to removal of the age cap - were suspended from parliamentary proceedings on Monday for alleged disorderly conduct and refusing to heed the speaker s instructions. The bill to amend the constitution was introduced in parliament on October 4 by a Museveni loyalist, after two consecutive days of brawling in the debating chamber between those opposed and those in favor, supported by security personnel.  On the second day, security personnel who some MPs said were soldiers from an elite military unit entered the chamber and violently ejected at least 25 MPs that the speaker had suspended from proceedings for alleged misconduct.  Wednesday s vote was the second time Ugandan parliament has changed the constitution to allow Museveni extend his rule. In 2005, they voted to remove a limit of two five-year terms, which blocked him from standing again. The bill also extended the length of a term for MPs to seven years from the current five. The limit of two terms was also re-imposed for the president, although that only means Museveni would be limited to two more terms, starting with the 2021 election.  Are you not seeing what happened in Zimbabwe, do we want his excellency to end like Gaddafi of Libya,  opposition legislator, Gilbert Olanya, who opposed to the amendment, said in Wednesday s debate as he attempted to persuade colleagues to reject it. Several African leaders have amended laws designed to limit their tenure. Such moves have fueled violence in countries including Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. Initially hailed for restoring political order and fostering economic growth, Museveni has lately come under mounting pressure fueled by runaway corruption, and accusations he uses security forces to maintain his grip on power.  A combination of both military and police personnel were heavily deployed around parliament this week, which opposition MPs say was meant to intimidate members.  ',\n",
       " '(128 fans) - Advertisement - \\nOfficially, of course, the national bird of the United States is that half-a-peace-sign that Philadelphia sports fans like to hold up at opposing teams. But unofficially, the film National Bird has it right: the national bird is a killer drone. \\nFinally, finally, finally, somebody allowed me to see this movie. And finally somebody made this movie. There have been several drone movies worth seeing , most of them fictional drama , and one very much worth avoiding ( Eye in the Sky ). But National Bird is raw truth, not entirely unlike what you might fantasize media news reports would be in a magical world in which media outlets gave a damn about human life. \\nThe first half of National Bird is the stories of three participants in the U.S. military\\'s drone murder program, as told by them. And then, just as you\\'re starting to think you\\'ll have to write that old familiar review that praises how well the stories of the victims among the aggressors were told but asks in exasperation whether any of the victims of the actual missiles have any stories, National Bird expands to include just what is so often missing, and even to combine the two narratives in a powerful way. \\nHeather Linebaugh wanted to protect people, benefit the world, travel, see the world, and use super cool technology. Apparently our society did not explain to her in time what it means to join the military. Now she suffers guilt, anxiety, moral injury, PTSD, sleep disorder, despair, and a sense of responsibility to speak out on behalf of friends, other veterans, who have killed themselves or become too alcoholic to speak for themselves. Linebaugh helped murder people with missiles from drones, and watched them die, and identified body parts or watched loved ones gather up body parts. \\nEven while still in the Air Force, Linebaugh was on a suicide watch list and had a psychologist recommend moving her to a different sort of job, but the Air Force refused. She has episodes. She sees things. She hears things. But she\\'s forbidden to discuss her work with friends or even with a therapist who doesn\\'t have the proper \"security clearance.\" \\nWe let Daniel down even more than Heather. He says he actually opposed militarism but was homeless and desperate, so he joined the military. We could have given him a house for much less than we paid him to help murder people at Fort Meade. \\nLisa Ling worked on a database filled by drone surveillance that compiled information on 121,000 \"targets\" in two years. Multiply that by a dozen years. With 90% of victims not among the targets, add up how many people would die in the targeting of the whole list. That\\'d be over 7 million. But it\\'s not numbers that have poisoned the souls of these three veterans; it\\'s children and mothers and brothers and uncles lying in pieces on the ground. \\nLing travels to Afghanistan to see the place at ground level and to meet with drone victims. She meets a little boy who lost his leg and his 4-year-old brother and his sister and his father. On February 2, 2010, drone \"pilots\" at Creech Air Base murdered 23 innocent members of one family. - Advertisement - \\nThe filmmakers have voices read the written transcript of what the drone operators said to each other before, during, and after sending in the missiles that did the damage. This is worse than Collateral Murder . The people whose job it is to identify children and others who should not be murdered have identified children among the group of people being targeted. The \"pilots\" at Creech are eager to reject this information and to get onto killing as many people as they can. Their lust for blood drives the decision process. Only after they\\'ve killed 23 people do they recognize children among the survivors, and the lack of guns. \\nWe see the bodies brought home to bury. Those injured describe their suffering, physical as well as mental. We see people being fitted with artificial legs. We hear Afghans describe their perception of drones. They imagine, just as many Americans may imagine, and just as viewers of Eye in the Sky would imagine, that drone operators have a clear, high resolution view of everything. In fact, they have a view of fuzzy little blobs on a computer screen that looks like it was created in the 1980s. \\nLinebaugh says there is no way to distinguish the little \"civilian\" blobs from little \"militant\" blobs. When Daniel hears President Obama claim that there is always near certainty that no civilians will be killed, Daniel explains that such knowledge is simply not possible. Linebaugh says she was often on the side of the conversation telling the \"pilots\" at Creech not to murder innocents, but that they always pushed for permission to kill. \\nJesselyn Radack, attorney for whistleblowers, says in the film that the FBI told two whistleblowers that a terrorist group had put them on a kill list. She said that the FBI has also contacted Linebaugh\\'s family and warned her that \"terrorists\" have been searching for her name online, suggesting that she fix this problem by shutting up. (She had written an op-ed in the Guardian ). \\nThe FBI also raids Daniel\\'s house, arriving with 30 to 50 agents, badges, guns, cameras, and search warrants. They take away his papers, electronics, and phone. They tell him he is under investigation for a possible indictment under the Espionage Act. This is the World War I-era law for targeting foreign enemies that President Obama has made a routine of using to target domestic whistleblowers. While Obama has prosecuted more people under this law than did all previous presidents combined, we probably have no way of knowing how many people have been explicitly threatened with the possibility. - Advertisement - \\nWhile we should be apologizing to, comforting, and aiding these young people rather than denying them the right to speak to anybody and threatening them with decades in prison, Lisa Ling did manage to find some kindness. Victims of drone strikes in Afghanistan told her that they forgave her. As the film ends, she\\'s planning another trip to Afghanistan.

       " 'WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Transgender people still face discrimination and threats to their safety in North Carolina despite lawmakers replacing a measure that restricted their access to many public bathrooms, advocacy groups said in a new federal court action on Friday. The law thrust the state into the center of a national debate over equality, privacy and religious freedom last year by requiring transgender people to use restrooms in state-run buildings that matched the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. A new measure, passed in March, helped bring back some business and sports events pulled from the state in protest in the year after it enacted the so-called bathroom bill. But the replacement law lacks clarity, with top state leaders in disagreement about what it means for transgender bathroom access, the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal argue in their amended lawsuit. That leaves transgender people uncertain - even fearful - about which restrooms they can safely use, they said. â\\x80\\x9cWhen legislation fails to protect us, when it leaves us in limbo, it sends a message that our lives are expendable,â\\x80\\x9d plaintiff JoaquÃ\\xadn CarcaÃ±o, a transgender man who works at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told reporters. The amended complaint expands the lawsuit filed last year to challenge HB 2, which the stateâ\\x80\\x99s Republican leaders said was needed for public safety. The new law, HB 142, rescinded HB 2 but left many of its harmful effects in place, opponents say. The current law bars state agencies, schools and local governments from regulating government-run restrooms, showers and changing facilities, leaving responsibility for those policies with state lawmakers. It also bans cities in the state from passing their own anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people until 2020. Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat who signed the new law, is now named as a defendant in the lawsuit, replacing former Republican Governor Pat McCrory, whose defeat in the 2016 election is partly blamed on his support for the old law. Cooper has called the replacement law imperfect but necessary to help repair North Carolinaâ\\x80\\x99s damaged reputation.  â\\x80\\x9cThe governorâ\\x80\\x99s ultimate goal is statewide LGBT protections, and he is going to continue working toward that,â\\x80\\x9d Cooper spokesman Ford Porter said in a statement on Friday. A battle over bathrooms also flared on Friday in Texas, where lawmakers heard impassioned public testimony about proposals to limit public restroom access to transgender people in that state. ',\n",

Dershowitz then made the key point that just as newspapers are free to print any information they obtain from others, even when the source obtains it illegally, candidates for office have the same right to get information anywhere they want.He also stressed again there is no legal precedent to treat information as money under U.S. campaign finance laws: You can t include information under the campaign finance law.

       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran s allies in Lebanon have emerged even stronger from a crisis triggered by Saudi Arabia, which achieved little more than to force the Saudis  main Lebanese ally - Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri - closer to Tehran s friends in Beirut.    Saudi Arabia aimed to hurt Iran in Lebanon by forcing Hariri s resignation on Nov. 4 and torpedoing his coalition deal with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies, using its influence over the Sunni leader to cause trouble for the Shi ite group. Instead, the move backfired as Western states censured Riyadh over a step they feared would destabilize Lebanon, despite their shared concerns over the regional role of the heavily armed Hezbollah. Hariri revoked his resignation on Tuesday, drawing a line under the crisis caused by his announcement from Riyadh. Lebanese officials say he was put under house arrest before French intervention led to his return home. Riyadh and Hariri deny this. But while the crisis has abated, its causes - Hezbollah s growing military influence in the region and Saudi Arabia s determination to counter Iran - seem likely to bring more trouble Lebanon s way sooner or later. Hariri has identified possible Gulf Arab sanctions as a major risk to the Lebanese economy. Analysts also see a risk of another war with Hezbollah s old foe, Israel, which is alarmed by the group s strength in Lebanon and Syria. The episode also leaves big questions over Lebanese politics, long influenced by Saudi Arabia, a patron of the Lebanese Sunni community. One senior Lebanese politician said the experience had  left a big scar  on Hariri, once the  the spiritual son of Saudi Arabia .  After this, it will not be easy to have a normal relationship again.  Meeting on Tuesday for the first time since the resignation, Hariri s government indirectly acknowledged Saudi concerns over Hezbollah s role outside Lebanon. At Hariri s behest, it reaffirmed its policy of staying out of Arab conflicts. A top Lebanese official said Western pressure forced Saudi Arabia to retreat from its Lebanon plan but further Saudi moves could not be ruled out:  Can we restrain Saudi from going toward madness? In my view, no.  A Western diplomat said Saudi measures targeting the Lebanese economy were  a genuine possibility  at some point though the international community would likely try to influence how tough any sanctions would be.   I think the Saudis have understood from the international reaction that Lebanon isn t a pitch on which they are playing alone. There are other players who have interests who don t want to see those undermined,  the diplomat said.  At the same time, the international community s patience isn t unlimited. It will be hard to protect Lebanon indefinitely if there is no tangible progress on rolling back Hezbollah.  Hezbollah was the only group allowed to keep its weapons at the end of Lebanon s 1975-90 civil war to fight Israeli forces occupying southern Lebanon. Its militia has been a source of controversy in Lebanon since the Israeli withdrawal of 2000. With Saudi backing, Hariri led a Lebanese political alliance to confront the group, but that resulted in Hezbollah s takeover of Beirut in 2008 during a brief civil war. Hezbollah s stature has grown in the chaos that swept the Arab world after 2011. It has backed President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and helped in the war against Islamic State in Iraq.     But its role in the Yemen conflict is seen as the main factor behind the crisis in Lebanon. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran and Hezbollah of military support for the Iranian-allied Houthis in their war with a Saudi-led coalition. Hariri has repeatedly flagged Yemen as the cause of the latest crisis, and warned that Lebanon s economy is at stake. The economy depends on remittances from expat workers, particularly in the Gulf. Any threat to inflows is seen as a risk to the system that finances the heavily indebted state. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has appeared to recalibrate his rhetoric in response to the crisis. Last month, he denied his group was fighting in Yemen, or sending weapons to the Houthis, or firing rockets at Saudi Arabia from Yemeni territory. He also indicated Hezbollah could pull its fighters from Iraq. The remarks on the eve of Hariri s return were seen as  appeasing , a source close to Hariri said. Hariri has twice led coalition governments including Hezbollah despite his enmity toward the group: five Hezbollah members have been charged by a U.N.-backed tribunal with the 2005 assassination of his father, Rafik al-Hariri. Hezbollah denies any involvement. Hariri s willingness to compromise with Hezbollah was a factor behind the Saudi move against him and has drawn criticism from within the Sunni community. His status as Lebanon s most influential Sunni will be put to the test in parliamentary elections next year. Ashraf Rifi, a hawkish Sunni politician, said the way Hariri reversed his resignation was a  farce  and a  surrender to the Hezbollah project . The senior politician, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Hezbollah may offer Hariri a  gesture  over its regional role but saw little prospect of the group fundamentally changing course. President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, could pressure the group  a little bit to be cooler on certain issues , the politician said. But Lebanese in Saudi Arabia still had reason to be afraid for their livelihoods:  I think with time the Lebanese will try to disentangle themselves from Saudi Arabia, but this will cost Lebanon a lot because revenues will be reduced.  The Hariri crisis marked an unprecedented intervention in Lebanon, even in a country with a long history of foreign meddling. It also underlined the different priorities of Saudi Arabia and its Western allies in Lebanon - a major recipient of aid to help it host 1.5 million Syrian refugees. On the last day of Hariri s stay in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman summoned him for a meeting and kept him waiting for hours, delaying his departure for France where President Emanuel Macron was waiting for him, the senior politician and a top Lebanese official said.  Macron was calling Saad to find out where he was,  said the senior politician, adding that Macron then called Crown Prince Mohammad to tell him he was expecting Hariri for lunch. Western states want stability in Lebanon, the politician said.  They need Lebanon as a platform for observing the Arab world. They have invested a lot here, and if there is a civil war, (there is the question of) what to do with all the Syrian refugees.  ',\n",

       " 'Donald Trump expects to be in a position to offer the United Kingdom a free trade deal within the â\\x80\\x9cfirst six months or the first yearâ\\x80\\x9d of his administration, says Anthony Scaramucci, the noted entrepreneur and host of the Wall Street Week programme who will serve as the incoming presidentâ\\x80\\x99s Director of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs. [Speaking to ITV News, the SkyBridge Capital founder confirmed that the current plan is to â\\x80\\x9cget in the White House and get the president inaugurated and then take the steps necessary to make sure the UK is at the front of the line, as opposed to at the back the line, on trade dealsâ\\x80\\x9d.  Scaramucciâ\\x80\\x99s reference to â\\x80\\x9cthe back of the lineâ\\x80\\x9d was a call back to outgoing president Barack Obama threatening that the British would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal if they voted to leave the European Union (EU) which does not allow its members to strike trade deals on their own. Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s use of the word â\\x80\\x9cqueueâ\\x80\\x9d which is uncommon in   raised suspicions that he had been fed lines by the   former prime minister, David Cameron, and Scaramucciâ\\x80\\x99s decision to use the more traditional â\\x80\\x9clineâ\\x80\\x9d may have been significant. Scaramucciâ\\x80\\x99s positive comments come shortly after the   himself pledged to get a trade deal â\\x80\\x9cdone quickly and done properlyâ\\x80\\x9d after Brexit in an interview with The Times of London, while congratulation the British public on their decision to leave an EU which is â\\x80\\x9cbasically a vehicle for Germanyâ\\x80\\x9c. â\\x80\\x9cWe see the unique, special relationship bond and love that these countries and people have for each other,â\\x80\\x9d Scaramucci told ITN, echoing sentiments expressed by Trump himself. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m a big fan of the UKâ\\x80\\x9d said the Republican leader, reminiscing about his Scottish motherâ\\x80\\x99s pride in the Queen.

       " \"Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald says wait times aren't the best measure of whether care at VA hospitals is improving. Satisfaction matters more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom crisis comes opportunity,â\\x80\\x9d says Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald. â\\x80\\x9cThe deeper the crisis, the bigger the changes that can be made.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSecretary McDonald has had the opportunity to test that theory. A West Point graduate and former chairman and CEO of Procter and Gamble, McDonald was nominated by President Obama to run the VA in wake of a 2014 scandal at its Phoenix hospital. Critics charged that as many as 40 patients died as a result of waiting for treatment in Phoenix and that some VA employees there falsified records on how long patients actually waited.\\n\\nAt a Monitor-hosted breakfast with reporters in the lead up to Memorial Day, the secretary was questioned about why the VA does not publicly report when veterans first ask for an appointment, known as the â\\x80\\x9ccreate date.â\\x80\\x9d The information can be used to calculate how long vets had to wait for an appointment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe days to an appointment is really not what we should be measuring. What we should be measuring is the veteranâ\\x80\\x99s satisfaction,â\\x80\\x9d McDonald said. â\\x80\\x9cWhat really counts is how does the veteran feel about their encounter with the VA? When you go to Disney, do they measure the number of hours you wait in line? What is important is, what is your satisfaction with the experience.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe secretary added, â\\x80\\x9cwhat I would like to move to actually is that kind of measure. We are in the process of creating that kind of measure, validating that kind of measure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe reference to Disney theme parks prompted House Speaker Paul Ryan (R) of Wisconsin to respond to McDonaldâ\\x80\\x99s breakfast comments with a tweet:Â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cThis is not make-believe, Mr. Secretary. Veterans have died waiting in those lines.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSecretary McDonald was also asked about a recent column in Roll Call newspaper, suggesting that Hillary Clinton should consider him as her running mate. Columnist Jonathan Allen argued that McDonald â\\x80\\x9ctrumps [Donald] Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s business-world experienceâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9ctook on the thankless task of reshaping the broken bureaucracy of the VAâ\\x80¦.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMcDonald responded, â\\x80\\x9cThe way I look at all these things is just as I looked at when the White House contacted me about this job. I went to West Point. My lifeâ\\x80\\x99s mission has been to help improve the lives of others and if I am asked to serve I certainly will consider it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith the Obama administration coming to end in January 2017, McDonald is trying to deliver on what he calls 12 â\\x80\\x9cbreakthrough prioritiesâ\\x80\\x9d before the end of this year, including improving the experience veterans have dealing with the VA, increasing access to health care, developing a simplified appeals process, and reducing veterans homelessness.\\n\\nThe secretary cited gains in a variety of areas. In the past 12 months, the VA completed 1.6 million more appointments than in the previous year. Average wait times are now five days for primary care, six days for specialty care, and three days for mental health care, he said.\\n\\nBut McDonald admits that those average wait times are not the experience for vets in all of its facilities. â\\x80\\x9cThere are tails at the end of that distribution and some of those tails are what we are trying to deal with.â\\x80\\x9d For example, he said, veterans have been part of the general movement of the population to the South, and the VA needs to build facilities there.\\n\\nHe added that â\\x80\\x9cwe know we have an issue getting people in. We know that and we are working hard on it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe VA is a massive management challenge.Â\\xa0 It runs the largest integrated health care system in the US. It operates 1,200 health care facilities, has 350,000 employees, including 25,000 physicians who serve nine million patients. If it were a business weighed in the Fortune 500 rankings, McDonald said, it would rank sixth.\\n\\nWhen asked what issues would confront his successor, McDonald noted that, â\\x80\\x9cone of the things we have committed to here is same-day resolution of a medical issue for any veteranâ\\x80¦. It may not solve the issue, but we will get them the help they need that same day. We already do that at about 25 percent of our facilities.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA second issue his successor will face is the need to â\\x80\\x9cget the appeals backlog down,â\\x80\\x9d McDonald said. There currently are 440,000 appeals of VA benefits decisions pending. â\\x80\\x9cIn order to get that backlog down, there is only one thing we can do and that is pass legislation that changes the 80 year-old law that governs appeals,â\\x80\\x9d he said. The law currently allows vets to file unlimited amendments to their claims.\",\n",
       " 'There cannot be any bigger example of irony in American politics than Donald Trump s newest proposal for immigrants coming into the United States.According to a new report, Donald Trump will put forth a proposal that will test incoming immigrants on their support for  American values  as a litmus test for citizenship. What will these questions entail? Whether or not these immigrants support gender equality, gay rights, religious freedom and the rule of American law.The irony is rich   a man who has no respect for gender equality, gay rights, religious freedom or the rule of law is going to ask hardworking immigrants if they support the things he does not. Maybe it s a catch 22   perhaps if the immigrants answer  YES  to any of the following a Trump Administration would deny them entry.Suppose an immigrant comes through and is asked if he or she does not support gay rights. Like many Christians in this country, many Muslims or Catholics from South America do not support same-sex marriage. If a Muslim or a South American Catholic answer that they do not support same-sex marriage, would a Trump Administration brand them, ultimately, as anti-gay?Remember, Donald Trump doesn t support same-sex marriage.In other words, he himself would most likely fail his own immigration test.Trump s senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, told the Associated Press that the aim of the new litmus test was to selectively determine who our  friends  are and which immigrants would best be equipped to fight against  radical Islamic terrorism.  So there it is   this isn t a test on all immigrants; it s really a test on Muslims cleverly disguised as a legitimate part of immigration customs.I guess that whole adhering to religious freedom thing doesn t ring true for Trump or his lily white allies. Miller also told the AP that the purpose of the litmus test is to fill the cracks left by gaps in traditional vetting from countries that are, well, predominantly Muslim (even though our vetting process is meticulous).Once again Trump s  policy proposal  has fallen flat. When your own candidate couldn t pass such a subjective test, it s best not to make others take it.Featured image via Jeff Swensen/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'At a press conference on Tuesday, President Obama could barely hide his frustration towards the would be obstructionists in the Senate who say they will block any potential Supreme Court nominee he suggests for the remainder of his term.When asked by a reporter what he thought about the political move by Republicans to block the process until after the next election, Obama didn t hold back. At times Obama s normally calm rhetorical style gave way to more and more passion as his disbelief in how badly these senators were behaving became apparent. In the past, this has not been viewed as a question. There is no unwritten law that says it can only be done on off years. That s not in the constitutional text. I m amused to hear when people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution, suddenly reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there. Republicans have spent the days after Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s death arguing that Obama should not be allowed to use the next year of his presidency selecting a new nominee. Instead, they have feigned the belief that in the last year in office a president must sit on his hands until the election is over. As Obama points out, this has never been a thing. Notably, as recently as 1988, President Ronald Reagan appointed a new justice during an election year and nobody batted an eye.In a nice little dagger twist, President Obama then put the spotlight back on Republicans who vow to not do their jobs. Rather than allow partisan point scoring get in the way of yet another Democratic process, Obama suggested this could  be a good moment to rise above that  and show America that Congress isn t a complete-and-utter mess. This is the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land. It s the one court where we would expect elected officials to rise above day-to-day politics. This will be the opportunity for Senators to do their job.Your job doesn t stop until you are voted out or until your term expires. Obama also used the time to make it abundantly clear that he isn t about to be held hostage by the Republican obstructionists either. In one of the most crackling exchanges of the presser, a reporter asked the President if he would be nominating a moderate so that he might be able to appease Republicans and get them to do their jobs. He was not amused. No. No. Where did you get that idea? Obama reaffirmed that he would be selecting a candidate based on their merit and on the belief that they would be the best person for the job, not on whether or not he thought a group of conservative politicians would like the pick.As is typical in President Obama s second term, this was a take-no-prisoners moment. Having watched Republicans openly vow to stop him from accomplishing anything, even if it meant harming the country as collateral damage, his new strategy is not to even try to work with them. Instead, he has begun to call them out at every term. A name-and-shame scorched earth policy that is making it harder and harder for obstructionists to get a free pass to continue poisoning the political process.It s fun to watch.Featured image via NBC News',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON/ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - President Donald Trump forged a surprising deal with Democrats in Congress on Wednesday to extend the U.S. debt limit and provide government funding until Dec. 15, embracing his political adversaries and blindsiding fellow Republicans in a rare bipartisan accord. Trump, living up to his reputation for unpredictability, met at the White House with congressional leaders from both parties and overruled Republicans and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who wanted a longer-term debt-limit extension rather than the three-month Democratic proposal the president embraced. â\\x80\\x9cWe could have done a one-year deal today,â\\x80\\x9d Mnuchin told reporters aboard Air Force One later in the day en route back to Washington from an event in North Dakota where Trump spoke about taxes. Mnuchin said Trump chose a short-term deal to keep his options open on possibly raising military funding later this year, suggesting a longer-term government funding deal might have blocked that. Trump is very focused on military spending, â\\x80\\x9cparticularly with whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on in North Korea and other parts of the world today,â\\x80\\x9d Mnuchin said. â\\x80\\x9cThe president wasnâ\\x80\\x99t willing to give up his need for additional military spending.â\\x80\\x9d If passed by the Republican-led Congress, the three-month agreement would avert an unprecedented default on U.S. government debt, keep the government funded at the outset of the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and provide aid to victims of Hurricane Harvey. â\\x80\\x9cIt was a really good moment of some bipartisanship and getting things done,â\\x80\\x9d top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said. Less than an hour before the meeting, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan had called the Democratic proposal that Trump later embraced a â\\x80\\x9cridiculous and disgracefulâ\\x80\\x9d idea that would â\\x80\\x9cplay politics with the debt ceiling.â\\x80\\x9d Even with the three-month extension of the debt limit, a Senate Republican aide told reporters that nothing in the tentative deal would stop the Treasury Department from using its powers to extend the deadline, depending on revenue flow. In the past, the debt limit deadline has been extended for several months under those powers. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, overridden by Trump during the meeting, said he would bring the deal to the Senate floor for a vote. â\\x80\\x9cThe president can speak for himself, but his feeling was that we needed to come together, to not create a picture of divisiveness at a time of genuine national crisis,â\\x80\\x9d McConnell told reporters. The agreement was an uncommon instance of bipartisan compromise since Trump took office in January. Washington has suffered through bitter partisanship that has at times left the U.S. capital dysfunctional under Trump and his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump had tangled repeatedly with Schumer and top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi. â\\x80\\x9cWe had a very good meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer,â\\x80\\x9d Trump, a wealthy businessman who as a candidate touted his deal-making skills, told reporters aboard Air Force One, without mentioning McConnell or Ryan, with whom he has had fraught relations. â\\x80\\x9cWe agreed to a three-month extension on debt ceiling, which they consider to be sacred, very important. Always weâ\\x80\\x99ll agree on debt ceiling, automatically because of the importance of it,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. Conservative groups were aghast, accusing Trump of caving in to the Democrats rather than insisting on spending cuts to accompany the debt ceiling increase, and some hard-line Republicans expressed opposition to it. Republican leaders and Mnuchin pushed in the meeting for an 18-month debt limit hike, then floated six months, but Pelosi and Schumer held firm to their three-month proposal and Trump sided with them, according to people familiar with the meeting. The party in power, in this case Republicans, often argues for the longest debt limit increase as possible for two reasons. First, it protects members of Congress from casting multiple votes on the politically unpopular legislation over a short period of time, especially in the run-up to the 2018 congressional elections. Second, it helps stabilize markets.  For minority Democrats, whose votes are needed to pass debt ceiling increases, they could potentially use the debt limit vote later in the year as leverage to win concessions on a tax overhaul package that Trump badly wants to advance. Even though Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, Trump has yet to win passage of any major legislation, with Democrats typically united against him. The House on Wednesday approved roughly $8 billion in initial emergency aid for relief and rebuilding after Hurricane Harvey, which tore into Texas on Aug. 25, with the measure now going to the Senate.    â\\x80\\x9cOur No. 1 priority was getting funding for Harvey,â\\x80\\x9d Mnuchin said. â\\x80\\x9cTo get the funding for Harvey, we needed to extend the debt limit.â\\x80\\x9d U.S. shares rose and the dollar gained against the safe-haven Japanese yen as word of the deal helped mitigate investor concerns about North Korea and a major hurricane barreling toward Florida. The news also lifted the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR after it had fallen to a near 10-month low at 2.054 percent. The Treasury Department has said the ceiling must be raised in the next few weeks. If not, the government would be unable to borrow more money or pay its bills, including its debt payments.

       " 'How is the wicked witch of the White House still allowed to talk on television?When House Republicans passed their Trumpcare bill on Thursday, they did so without reading it or getting a CBO score for it, which made it easier for them to close their eyes and vote to screw over the American people, including their own constituents.Trump s healthcare bill would strip healthcare from millions of Americans. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, 45,000 people in this country died every year due to a lack of accessible and affordable healthcare. The Trumpcare bill would repeal President Obama s signature law and put thousands of Americans at risk of dying because they can t get health insurance.But Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News on Sunday to deny that people die because of not having health insurance. In short, her attempt to defend Trump s bill was pathetic and insulting.First, she referred to Americans who oppose Trump s bill as liars jeering from the  cheap seats. Look, it s easier to jeer from the cheap seats than come up with a message of your own and be honest about the facts,  Conway said.  How did we get here? Why have so many Americans asked for Obamacare to be repealed and replaced? It s because you have premiums that have increased by 40 percent on average. And then she whined about opponents warning that the bill will kill people and accused them of using scare tactics. You know, saying people are going to die   and the enablers in the mainstream media not calling out those breathless, heartless predictions, and going right on to prognostication for 2018. Why in the world are we talking about who is going to win in 2018 when the duty of the mainstream media, of  news reporters  is to tell you what s actually in the bill, not to allow others to scare. Here s the video via YouTube.You know who is really being breathless and heartless? Kellyanne Conway.Once again, she is lying to the American people and insulting everyone who opposes Donald Trump and his downright evil agenda.It is a FACT that thousands of people died every year because they can t afford health insurance.The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, which is why Democrats have offered to work with Republicans to fix what needs to be fixed, but Republicans are so obsessed with erasing every achievement made by President Obama that they are unwilling to do so. They would rather scrap the entire law instead.The problem is that the Republican bill does not protect people with pre-existing conditions. In fact, it classifies pregnancy, PTSD, and sexual assault as pre-existing conditions that would disqualify people from getting health insurance. Furthermore, it slaps senior citizens with an age tax and puts a limit on how long insurance will cover their needs. It also makes them pay MORE for healthcare than they currently do now under the Affordable Care Act.Trump s bill would make it impossible for low-income Americans to afford health insurance, thereby sentencing them to death if they get seriously sick and can t afford care.Basically, Trump s bill really does include death panels, which, interestingly enough, was a lie that Republicans repeatedly used to scare people into opposing the Affordable Care Act. Now they are accusing Democrats of doing the same thing even though Trump s bill would repeal a law that has literally saved thousands of lives over the years. Trump s bill would end those lives.Featured Image: Screenshot',\n",
       " 'Washington (CNN) Security conditions at U.S. military bases have been increased over growing concerns about terror threats, officials said Friday.\\n\\nA U.S. official confirmed to CNN that U.S. military bases are now at \"Force Protection Bravo,\" which is defined by the Pentagon as an \"increased and predictable threat of terrorism.\" It is the third-highest threat level on a five-tier scale used by the Department of Defense.\\n\\nU.S. military officials added Friday that the announcement, which comes in the aftermath of the shooting at a Texas cartoon contest featuring drawings of the Prophet Mohammed, was not the result of a specific threat but because the military had become concerned about several recent incidents.\\n\\nThe military became alarmed when one of the jihadists linked to the Garland attack tweeted the name and address of a U.S. military officer connected to the military\\'s Syrian rebel training program, a U.S. military official told CNN.\\n\\nThe tweet, first published on an account connected to British-born jihadist Junaid Hussain, was sent out a few days before the attack on the cartoon exhibit and appeared to encourage an attack on the address.\\n\\nHussain is the same jihadist who is also believed, according to U.S. law enforcement officials, to have been messaging with Elton Simpson, one of the two attackers of the Texas event, and had been urging Simpson to take action.\\n\\nThat followed the publishing several weeks ago on ISIS-connected accounts of the name and addresses of about 100 military members.\\n\\nOn Thursday, FBI Director James Comey told reporters that there are thousands of ISIS, also known as ISIL, followers online in the U.S.\\n\\n\"We have a general concern, obviously, that ISIL is focusing on the uniformed military and law enforcement,\" Comey told reporters Thursday.\\n\\nThe order to upgrade the threat level was signed by Admiral William Gortney, head of the U.S. Northern Command, which oversees all U.S. military installations in the continental U.S. The security order affects 3,200 sites, including bases, National Guard facilities, recruiting stations and health clinics, a Pentagon official said.\\n\\n\"We have the same concern about the potential threat posed by violent homegrown extremists,\" said Captain Jeff Davis, spokesman for the U.S. Northern Command, or NORTHCOM.\\n\\nDavis declined to specify the new security measures.\\n\\nBut the change in threat level status could mean more checks of vehicles entering bases, and more thorough identity checks of all personnel. Davis emphasized that \"this is the new normal, that we are going to have increased vigilance and force protection. We seek to be unpredictable.\"\\n\\nA U.S. military official said the order to raise the force protection level to Bravo also applies to all National Guard installations, recruiting stations, and ROTC detachments, though practically speaking, the official acknowledges it will be difficult for the ROTC detachments to do much more than security awareness.\\n\\nIn addition, security was raised recently at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, in response to a perceived threat to the base security, another U.S. military official said. The threat was never deemed credible, but it came after another security concern at a base in Delaware used by Vice President Joe Biden when he flies home.\\n\\nOn Friday, Wright-Patterson announced that the Air Force museum, which is part of the base, was canceling a planned Friday night concert and was stopping tours that were regularly offered until further notice. The base said this was \"due to elevated security measures.\"\\n\\nSince NORTHCOM was established in October 2002, the threat level has reached Bravo on four occasions: Feb. 9, 2003, amid concerns al Qaeda was planning attacks on American targets; Dec. 21, 2003, when officials were concerned about attacks during the holiday season; May 1, 2011, in the aftermath of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden; and the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.\\n\\nIt reached \"Delta,\" its highest level, on Sept. 11, 2001, Pentagon officials told CNN at the time.',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - A Nevada judge on Tuesday rejected Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s request for records from a Las Vegas polling place that the campaign said had allowed people to vote after a deadline last week. Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton are in a close contest for Nevadaâ\\x80\\x99s six electoral votes in Tuesdayâ\\x80\\x99s election after a long and contentious campaign. Nevada is one of several states that permits early voting, and Las Vegas is viewed as a base of support for Clinton. Nevada state law says voters who are in line at 8 p.m., when the polls close, must be allowed to cast their ballots. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s lawsuit, filed in a Nevada state court on Monday, said election officials violated state law because they allowed people to join the line after 8 p.m. at a polling location at a Latino market during last weekâ\\x80\\x99s early voting period.  Trump, a New York businessman and reality TV personality who had never previously run for political office, said last month that he might not accept the outcome of the national election if he thinks it is unfair. â\\x80\\x9cToday may be the last time that ordinary citizens are able to stand up and say â\\x80\\x98Noâ\\x80\\x99 to an overreaching, unaccountable government controlled by a ruling establishment,â\\x80\\x9d Charles Munoz, the Nevada state director for Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign, said in a statement after the ruling.  The suit had asked the court to order officials to preserve various records from the Cardenas Market and to segregate ballots from the voting machines at issue.  At a court hearing in Las Vegas on Tuesday, a county attorney argued that election officials already preserve records. Sturman agreed, saying she did not want to issue an order that could help reveal which candidates were chosen by particular voters.  The Trump campaign also asked for information about poll workers on duty at the market, and Sturman said she was concerned they might face threats for helping people vote. â\\x80\\x9cHave you watched Twitter? Do you watch any cable news shows? People can get information and harass them,â\\x80\\x9d the judge said. Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said the campaign was pleased by the ruling. He described Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s suit as â\\x80\\x9ca desperate response to the record turnout weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing in Nevada and across the country.â\\x80\\x9d Dan Kulin, a spokesman for the Clark County Office of Public Communications, said that when early voting was taking place on Friday â\\x80\\x9cmost if not allâ\\x80\\x9d polling places had lines at the time they were scheduled to close.  â\\x80\\x9cAs has been our practice for many, many years, those early voting locations continued processing voters until the lines were gone,â\\x80\\x9d Kulin said.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Whether or not Richard Cordray stays as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) until his term ends in July, the agencyâ\\x80\\x99s ability to rein in Wall Street will be severely weakened, political insiders, lawyers and consumer advocates said. Doubts are growing that the Democratic director of Americaâ\\x80\\x99s top consumer watchdog will leave his post to run for Ohio governor, as had been widely speculated, after a lackluster Labor Day speech sparked anxiety over his campaign appeal, according to some party insiders. Cordray, whose term at the CFPB ends in July 2018, is not expected to announce any decision to run until the regulator releases long-awaited rules restricting payday lenders, which are expected within weeks, according to multiple sources. Cordray has evaded questions from the Republican chairman on the House of Representatives Financial Services committee, Jeb Hensarling, about his plans, writing in a recent letter: â\\x80\\x9cAt this time, I have no further insights to provide on that subject.â\\x80\\x9d Even if Cordray stays, he will not enjoy a reprieve from Republican efforts to defang the agency which they believe is too powerful and restricts the flow of credit. â\\x80\\x9cHe has been under constant attack in his position because of the threat he poses to the status quo on Wall Street,â\\x80\\x9d said Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress, a consumer advocacy group which has called for Cordray to stay on. â\\x80\\x9cI would imagine that would continue regardless of how long he stays in the job.â\\x80\\x9d Some Republicans, including Hensarling, have introduced legislation to weaken and even dismantle the agency which was created as part of the post-crisis Dodd Frank Act. While those bills have not gotten far, Cordray will still have to play defense against a Republican-dominated Congress poised to suffocate new CFPB rules using the Congressional Review Act, a mechanism already used to kill 14 Obama-era regulations. Lawmakers are also considering amending the government budget to bring the CFPBâ\\x80\\x99s funding, currently provided by the independent Federal Reserve, under the control of Congress, potentially allowing Republicans to starve the agency of resources. President Donald Trump could also take the more extreme step of intervening to remove Cordray.  A court ruling last year said the president should be able to fire the CFPB director without cause, which the CFPB is appealing. Even if the CFPB is victorious, Trump may still seek to use causes allowed by the law, such as inefficiency or neglect of duty, to get Cordray out of the way, according to legal experts. The CFPB has declined to comment multiple times on Cordrayâ\\x80\\x99s plans, possible successors or how it would operate in his absence. Since Trump came to power, the CFPB has raced to finish outstanding rule proposals and taken numerous enforcement actions, hoping to lock in its work in case Trump appoints a pro-Wall Street replacement, said Quyen Truong, a partner at law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, who was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the CFPB until early 2016. If Cordray quits or is removed, Dodd-Frank requires his deputy to step up temporarily but lawyers say the legitimacy of that step could be challenged. The act may be superseded by a law that allows the president to temporarily fill vacancies.  Alan Kaplinsky, head of the Consumer Financial Services Group at law firm Ballard Spahr and a Cordray critic, said the White House is widely expected to appoint Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin as an interim replacement, who would then delegate his duties to lower-ranking officials. Scrapping a new rule allowing bank and credit-card customers to band together in class-action lawsuits and tougher regulation of payday lenders will likely be a Trump appointeeâ\\x80\\x99s first moves, Kaplinsky said. This could be done by delaying the ruleâ\\x80\\x99s effective date for further study, a common Washington tactic used to stall the implementation of regulation indefinitely. An acting director could also dramatically scale back the consumer complaint database, a key tool the CFPB uses to resolve disputes for individuals and to identify corporate malfeasance, Truong said. Meanwhile, she said, the agency will continue pursuing enforcement cases, but those will likely be much smaller in scope. Jeff Emerson, a spokesperson for Hensarling, said any new director would naturally be bound by the law, but this person would have â\\x80\\x9ca lot of discretionâ\\x80\\x9d to make changes. ',\n",

Russia canâ\\x80\\x99t do whatever it wants.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nRussia says its Su-24 bomber did not violate Turkish airspace, but Turkish officials say it did. Putin hypothesized Tuesday that even if the plane did briefly enter Turkish airspace, it was not a threat.\\n\\n[This is the Russian plane that Turkey just shot down]\\n\\nIn Moscow at least, the event is being seen as something larger than an attack on an errant jet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe conflict happened because Russia was attacking rebel groups allied with Turkey,â\\x80\\x9d said Alexander Baunov, an analyst at the Moscow Carnegie Center, when asked about the possibility of an accidental clash. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s wrong to say that this happened because of anything like crowded skies.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Russian Defense Ministry announced in a statement Wednesday that Russian fighter jets will now escort the bombers, and Moscow will move into Syria powerful new ground-to-air missiles that can reach across the country and far into Turkey from the Russian air base in the province of Latakia on Syriaâ\\x80\\x99s Mediterranean coast.\\n\\nAdditionally, analysts say, Russia will choose from a menu of asymmetric responses in retaliation against Turkey, including informal economic sanctions and providing military aid to Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s enemies, including the Kurds.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, Russia is going to intensify strikes on that part of Syria and on those groups that are affiliated with Turkey,â\\x80\\x9d said Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian political analyst. He added that Russia probably would not scale back its deployment in Syria because of the incident.\\n\\nOn Wednesday evening, Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s state-run news agency, Anadolu, reported that Russian airstrikes targeted Turkish aid vehicles in the Syrian border town of Azzaz, killing at least seven drivers. The town is a hub for supplies being delivered from Turkey to Syrian rebels fighting government forces in the nearby city of Aleppo. The details of the incident could not be assessed independently.\\n\\nShady al-Ouaineh, a media Â\\xadrepresentative for Determined Storm, a rebel group associated with the Free Syrian Army, said in a telephone interview that Russia had dramatically intensified air raids in rebel-held areas of Latakia province. Syrian government forces and allied Shiite militiamen from Iraq, backed by Russian air cover, have been trying to advance on some of the last opposition holdouts in the province, said Ouaineh, close to where the Russian jet was shot down.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is clear Russia is taking out its revenge on us here,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\n[NATO faces new Mideast crisis after downing of Russian jet by Turkey]\\n\\nRussian attitudes toward Turkey, which were reasonably friendly a year ago, have turned cold with alarming speed. Most Russian tour operators stopped selling travel packages to Turkey on Wednesday. Protesters in Moscow pelted the Turkish Embassy with eggs and rocks, shattering windows. Russian lawmakers introduced a bill that would criminalize denying that the mass killings of Armenians in 1915 by the Ottoman Empire was a â\\x80\\x9cgenocide.â\\x80\\x9d The issue remains highly sensitive: Turkey acknowledges that atrocities occurred but has long denied that what took place constituted a genocide.\\n\\nLast December, Russia diverted a planned gas line away from Europe to Turkey in order to spurn the West. That projectâ\\x80\\x99s fate is also now in doubt.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe consequences are going to be significant,â\\x80\\x9d Lukyanov said.\\n\\nRussia will seek retribution against Turkey but wants to avoid antagonizing the West, Baunov said. â\\x80\\x9cIf this becomes a fight between Russia and the West, then that goes against the goals of the intervention in the first place: to escape international isolation connected to sanctions,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nThose sanctions were imposed after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and backed separatist rebels in Ukraineâ\\x80\\x99s southeast.\\n\\nPresident Obama, meeting with French President FranÃ§ois Hollande in Washington on Tuesday, said that Turkey had a right to defend its airspace and accused Russia of attacking moderate opposition groups as opposed to the Islamic State.

       " 'The Senate map is the Democratsâ\\x80\\x99 friend in the 2016 cycle. They are defending only 10 seats, while Republicans have two dozen to hold. But wait, it gets better. Seven of those 24 Republican seats are in states that President Obama won not once but twice: Florida, Illinois, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\\n\\nTo win the majority, Democrats need to win five of those seven seats in November 2016. (If Hillary Clinton, or another Democrat, wins the White House in 2016, then Senate Democrats need to win only four of those seven.) Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the exact path Republicans took to the Senate majority in 2014 when, needing a six-seat gain, they won all six of the Democratic-held seats â\\x80\\x94 Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia â\\x80\\x94 that Mitt Romney carried in 2012. (Republicans also won two states â\\x80\\x94 Iowa and Colorado â\\x80\\x94 that Obama carried twice, and one â\\x80\\x94 North Carolina â\\x80\\x94 that Obama won in 2008 and Romney won in 2012.)\\n\\nOf course, 2014 was a historically good year for Senate Republicans. The last time the party won more than nine seats in a midterm election was 1994, when it scored 10. Prior to 1994, you have to go back to 1946, when Republicans netted 12 seats.\\n\\nAnd while the map looks great for Democrats on paper, several of those seven races look less rosy in reality. Iowa is a tough Democratic pickup unless Sen. Charles E. GrassleyÂ\\xa0(R) decides to retire, which he insists he isnâ\\x80\\x99t going to do. Ohio Sen. Rob PortmanÂ\\xa0(R) is a gifted politician and fundraiser, while the Democratic bench in the state is decidedly thin. The Democratic fields in New Hampshire, Florida and Illinois are still quite muddled. And neither Sens. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) nor Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) are political dead men walking.\\n\\nThere are also two genuinely vulnerable Democrats â\\x80\\x94 Sens. Harry M. Reid (Nev.) and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) â\\x80\\x94 on the ballot in 2016.\\n\\nStill, as the 2014 election revealed, the map and the math are huge factors in the battle for the Senate. Both are on Democratsâ\\x80\\x99 side this time around.\\n\\nBelow are the 10 most competitive Senate contests on the ballot in 2016. The No.Â\\xa01Â\\xad-ranked race is the most likely to switch parties in 2016.\\n\\n10. Kentucky (Republican-controlled). Sen. Rand Paul (R) is staffing, as expected, for a presidential run next year. Paul still has to figure out how heâ\\x80\\x99s going to run for president and hold his Senate seat if that former race doesnâ\\x80\\x99t work out. His opponent in that effort could be none other than 2014 Senate nominee Alison Lundergan Grimes, given her role as Kentuckyâ\\x80\\x99s chief elections officer.\\n\\n9. Ohio (R). This may be the swing state at the presidential level. But Portman isnâ\\x80\\x99t seen as particularly vulnerable in 2016. A lot of that is because he banked $5.8 million by the end of 2014. Another big reason is that Democrats have a slim bench in Ohio. Among the names mentioned are Cincinnati Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld, former governor Ted Strickland, former congresswoman Betty Sutton and Rep. Tim Ryan.\\n\\n8. Florida (R). Whither Marco Rubio? The Florida senator could be the odd man out in the presidential race, with fellow Floridian Jeb Bush and other establishment-friendly candidates such as Mitt Romney and Chris Christie in the mix. Consider this: Rubio is just 43 years old, and heâ\\x80\\x99s got his 2016 reelection campaign to worry about. Perhaps itâ\\x80\\x99s better to focus on staying in the Senate and waiting for the next opportunity.\\n\\n7. New Hampshire (R). The question here is what Gov. Maggie Hassan (D) does. Democrats think thereâ\\x80\\x99s a decent chance she will run against Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R), but a New England College poll showed Ayotte leading that matchup by five points.\\n\\n6. Colorado (Democratic-controlled). No one thought Bennet would even be in the Senate in 2016. After being appointed as an unknown in 2009, he ran a perfect campaign in 2010 and benefited from the fact that his Republican opponent was, well, not very good. Given Coloradoâ\\x80\\x99s swinginess, Bennet will be a major Republican target again. But whom will Republicans put forward? Rep. Mike Coffman and newly elected state Attorney General Cynthia Coffman are mentioned â\\x80\\x94 theyâ\\x80\\x99re married â\\x80\\x94 as is Rep. Scott R. Tipton.\\n\\n5. North Carolina (R). Sen. Richard Burr (R) isnâ\\x80\\x99t doing much to inspire confidence in Republicans about his future plans. His fundraising is weak â\\x80\\x94 $720,000 on hand as of the end of September â\\x80\\x94 and rumors continue to swirl about him not running again in 2016. (Burr has said he plans to run.) If Democrats can persuade former senator Kay Hagan (D) to run, this race moves up on our rankings. But even if they donâ\\x80\\x99t, itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to see this not being a very competitive race in a presidential year.\\n\\n4. Pennsylvania (R). Attorney General Kathleen Kane (D) was once the Democratsâ\\x80\\x99 dream opponent for Toomey. She now faces potential criminal charges for allegedly violating the secrecy of a grand jury. The Democratic establishment does not want 2010 nominee and former congressman Joe Sestak as its nominee, but Sestak is pretty gung-ho about running again.\\n\\n3. Illinois (R). State Attorney General Lisa Madigan is the Democratsâ\\x80\\x99 first choice to take on Sen. Mark Kirk (R). But she has passed up so many winnable races for higher office that itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to see why she would run this time. If not Madigan, then Democrats will turn to Rep. Tammy Duckworth or Rep. Bill Foster. Kirk is an excellent fundraiser and knows the seriousness of the challenge he faces. Much depends on the top of the ticket; if the Democratic presidential nominee wins Illinois by 15 points (Obama carried it by 17 points), then itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to see a path to victory for Kirk.\\n\\n2. Nevada (D). Reid got knocked down â\\x80\\x94 hard â\\x80\\x94 while working out at his home in Nevada. He got so banged up that he missed the first days of Congress and might not regain vision in his right eye. He said it wonâ\\x80\\x99t affect his reelection decision. The bigger question is what Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) does. Does he wait for Reid to decide whether to seek reelection? Force his hand? This is a big question in a race Republicans would love to win to stem possible losses elsewhere. Meanwhile, former lieutenant governor Brian Krolicki, who blames Reid for a 2008 indictment that Krolicki later beat, is considering running.\\n\\n1. Wisconsin (R). Johnson seems unaware that he won a Democratic-leaning (at the federal level) state in 2010. He had the ninth most conservative record in the Senate, according to National Journalâ\\x80\\x99s 2013 vote ratings. Democrats are banking on former senator Russell Feingold, who lost to Johnson in 2010, running for his old seat. If Feingold does run, heâ\\x80\\x99ll have to put forth a much better campaign than he did five years ago. If he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t, expect Rep. Ron Kind, who has been itching to run statewide for as long as we can remember, to leap into the race.',\n",
       " 'KOSAMBI, Indonesia (Reuters) - Two explosions tore through a fireworks factory on the outskirts of Indonesia s capital on Thursday, killing at least 47 people and injuring dozens. It was one of Indonesia s worst industrial disasters and is likely to cast a new spotlight on lax safety standards in the Southeast Asian country, where rules are often ignored or weakly enforced. Workers had no time to escape from the plant in Tangerang, an industrial and manufacturing hub to the west of Jakarta, after the explosions that one neighbor described as a  roar  that could be heard miles away. A video of the scene inside the warehouse, widely shared on social media, showed charred bodies sprawled about the burnt-out factory, and Reuters reporters at the scene saw grass scorched over an area about 10 meters (33 feet) from the site.  People were burned so badly you couldn t see their faces ... It was really bad,  said search and rescue official Deden Nurjaman, who expected the death toll to climb as more bodies were found inside the factory. Fireworks are frequently used in Indonesia for religious and other celebrations, and are widely available. There have been a series of major fires in Indonesia this year, including one that engulfed one of Jakarta s main markets. Thick, dark plumes of smoke billowed from the factory through the afternoon as an inferno took hold. As night fell, the PT Panca Buana Cahaya Sukses warehouse was still smoldering and there was a stench of chemicals and burning plastic. Jakarta police spokesman Argo Yuwono told Metro Television that 47 bodies had been discovered, 46 people were injured and 10 people were unaccounted for. He said the missing might have left with light injuries or not have been working at the time. One of the first policemen on the scene, Raymond Masengi, told Metro TV that he and other officers had to smash holes in the factory wall to help the injured escape. Fiza, a doctor in the emergency unit at Tangerang General Hospital, said he was treating seven people, some of them with burns to more than 80 percent of their bodies. Three were in critical condition. A nearby mosque held prayers for the victims. Forensic police worked in fading light to examine the debris, setting up a few floodlights to try and establish the cause of the blaze.  Yuwono said police were looking into the permit of the factory, which was close to a school and housing and - according to media reports - had been operating for only two months.     A witness who lives around the corner from the factory said she heard an explosion  like a roar .  I dressed and stepped outside the house, and saw the flames, they were almost in my face. The smoke, the heat was in my face. I panicked, I was scared, I picked up my son and ran away from the fire,  said Kartini, 40, who uses one name, like many Indonesians. Hundreds of children at a school just 100 meters (yards) from the factory jumped in terror over a wall as the explosions boomed, dropping books and bags in their haste to get away.  Science teacher Asep Mahmud, 47, said:  There were several small explosions and then one really big one that shook our buildings and desks.

       " 'Ahhhh .social justice rears its ugly head in the transgender department.  Degendered  facilities are the new thing for campuses women who don t want to pee with guys are just out of luck How about social justice for women who do not want to share a public bathroom with men? Now that s justice!A New York City college has responded to transgender students who vandalized bathrooms by rewarding them with campus-wide  degendered  facilities.Bill Mea, acting president of Cooper Union, sent an email March 18 informing the campus community of the new restrooms, which will only be identified as  Restroom with Urinals and Stalls,   Restroom with Only Stalls,  and  Restroom Single Occupancy. We have always been ahead of our time and we must continue being leaders on issues of social justice,  Mea said.  We, who are in positions of power, have the obligation to not only stand with those without power, but to stand in front of them, clearing a path for them to walk. I cannot change the outside world and how it treats transgender and gender non-conforming people, but I can change the Cooper Union environment to help everyone feel safe when they are inside our buildings. The school president then appeared to make a veiled threat of disciplinary action for individuals who publicly protest his decision. I also ask that none of us practice gender policing, where we attempt to restrict someone from using the same restroom we are using or make them feel uncomfortable for doing so,  Mea said.  If you feel uncomfortable sharing a restroom, then the single-occupancy restrooms will now be available to you. The website Insider Higher Ed reported Thursday that Cooper Union may be the first college to completely eliminate gender distinctions in bathrooms. The process began two years ago when students removed bathroom signs and replaced them with banners reading  Bathroom  or  Degendered. Mea, who left the signs down in order to observe how students reacted, told the website that resistance was relegated to a  handful of alumni. I think you ll begin seeing this more and more,  Mea said.  We here in New York City, we have the support of our mayor and the support of our city. That allows us that opportunity to be more expansive, but obviously there may be less of an opportunity where other colleges are located. Doulos Christou, a reader at the education watchdog The College Fix, said Mea s decision has much more to do with control than supporting  those without power. Here s what the [LGBT] agenda is really about,  said Christou on Friday.  Demanding tolerance gave way to demanding recognition, which gave way to demanding equality, which is now giving way to demanding superiority. We ve written numerous things about this controversy and feel strongly about keeping the bathrooms segregated. One of the best arguments for this:WHAT S SO WRONG WITH TRANSGENDER BATHROOMS?

       " 'WASHINGTON  â\\x80\\x94   In President Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s world, boring is disruptive. After   weeks of gleefully setting the Washington establishment ablaze and declaring a new war with virtually every public utterance, Mr. Trump took the radical step on Tuesday night of delivering a soothing comfort food of an address to a jittery Congress and skeptical public. For the first time since his   in January, Mr. Trump seemed to accept the fetters of formality and tradition that define and dignify the presidency. And while he touched on all of the   elements of the economic nationalist agenda that has impelled his executive orders and calls for â\\x80\\x9crevolution,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump brandished a blunter rhetorical ax and, for once, delivered on his promise to speak the Reagan Republican dialect of optimism and reconciliation. Why the sudden shift? Numbers. Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s approval rating is the worst for any new president in recorded history  â\\x80\\x94   between 38 and 50 percent at a time when many presidents are in the 60s. Slamming the news media or   demonstrators energizes his base, but itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to move much higher in the polls without making a less partisan pitch. The other key statistic spurring his    adjustment: $54 billion, the amount of federal funding he hopes to siphon from other departments to increase spending at the Pentagon  â\\x80\\x94   a budget proposal that is already   on arrival, judging from its lukewarm reception on Capitol Hill this week. Presidents, even those commanding comfortable majorities in both houses, need to get Congress in line, and the only way to do that is to declare peace. Here are five takeaways from the most presidential speech Mr. Trump has ever given  â\\x80\\x94   delivered at precisely the moment he needed to project sobriety, seriousness of purpose and  . The   between Tuesdayâ\\x80\\x99s temperate Mr. Trump and the everyday Mr. Trump was striking, to put it mildly. â\\x80\\x9cThe time for trivial fights is over,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Trump, a man who spent the first 48 hours of his presidency bickering about the size of the inauguration crowd. While that statement was meant as a challenge to his establishment critics, it also seemed as if he were coaching himself. All of the previous   speeches delivered by Mr. Trump, from his nomination address in Cleveland last summer to his   inaugural speech, had a gloomy,    quality. His aides promised a Ronald   invocation of Americaâ\\x80\\x99s future in the days leading up to his  . What he delivered, thanks to his speechwriting team of Stephen Miller and Stephen K. Bannon, was an invocation of â\\x80\\x9cAmerican carnage. â\\x80\\x9d Since his   Mr. Trump roved the airwaves and Twitter, lashing out at anyone who opposed him, and many people who didnâ\\x80\\x99t. In just the past couple of weeks, the president has reiterated his description of some news outlets as â\\x80\\x9cenemies of the American people,â\\x80\\x9d while taking his shots at Paris, Sweden, Hill Democrats, the F. B. I. government leakers, President Barack Obama and his own communications staff, among other targets. But on Tuesday, the president rolled the dice, and went for nice. In style, if not substance, Mr. Trump delivered an address that nearly any of his Republican primary opponents  â\\x80\\x94   whom he once savaged as establishment stooges  â\\x80\\x94   might have delivered had they been standing at the rostrum. â\\x80\\x9cThat torch is now in our hands,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump said within the first few minutes of his speech, echoing, if not entirely approaching, the wispy mountaintop oratory of more polished predecessors like Mr. Obama and Mr. Reagan. â\\x80\\x9cAnd we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump has made immense progress sticking to a script, but Wednesday is a new day, and the presidential Twitter finger gets itchy in the middle of the week. The big question is whether his unifying tone represents the mythical,   pivot point  â\\x80\\x94   or was just part of a   speech efficiently delivered by a gifted politician learning his new trade. Mr. Trump has been criticized for his sluggish response to violence and vandalism against Jews, blacks and Muslims during his presidency. But the opening words of his speech were dedicated to tolerance and inclusion. â\\x80\\x9cRecent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last weekâ\\x80\\x99s shooting in Kansas City,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cremind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. â\\x80\\x9d Again, itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to say if his statement reflected a genuine change of approach. Mr. Trump and some allies have suggested that recent   episodes might be   attempts by his opponents to embarrass him. But his words were welcomed in the House chamber, greeted by some of the most sustained applause of the evening. The polls have not been especially kind to Mr. Trump lately, but there is one distinct bright spot: 56 percent of voters in a   Consult poll released on Tuesday said that Mr. Trump was following through on his campaign promises. This is no small matter for a president eager to prove heâ\\x80\\x99s no mere talker. For all its messaging, personnel and operational struggles, Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s team has relentlessly executed a branding strategy aimed at projecting the image of a man of action fighting against gridlocked and corrupt Washington elites. Every day, Mr. Trump appears before the cameras where he is shown doing stuff like signing executive orders or convening panels of business, labor or political leaders. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress Iâ\\x80\\x99ve made in keeping those promises,â\\x80\\x9d he said, taking an extended bow for saving jobs at several factories across the country, renegotiating defense contracts, scrapping the   Partnership, greenlighting two new fuel pipelines and cracking down on illegal immigration and criminal foreigners. Never mind that Mr. Obama, the man Mr. Trump says left him â\\x80\\x9ca messâ\\x80\\x9d to clean up, had accomplished much more at this point in his term  â\\x80\\x94   including the stimulus package and a gender   law. For all his newfound civility and message discipline, Mr. Trump cares most about this takeaway  â\\x80\\x94   proving he is an effective president at a time when his administration is being portrayed in the media as   adrift and  . The presidentâ\\x80\\x99s speech had admirable length (it clocked in at just over 60 minutes) the requisite number of ovations, about 90, and a succession of punchy pronouncements. What it didnâ\\x80\\x99t have was very much of an explanation on how Mr. Trump plans to govern. There were hardly any details about his proposals on the   items that will most likely define his first term. That included his Obamacare    pledge, his plan to overhaul the tax code, the big infrastructure package heâ\\x80\\x99s vowed to ram through, or even his plan to shovel $54 billion into the Defense Department. Cracking down on illegal immigration is the central pillar of Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s   popularity with white   voters, so much so that it was the subject of his most decisive action thus far as president: the bungled rollout of his executive order barring migrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations. But Mr. Trump and his team sent out some seriously mixed messages in the hours leading up to the address. â\\x80\\x9cWe will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump declared, to the delight of many Republicans in the hall, who gave him a hearty standing ovation. But earlier, in a   with some of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s leading news anchors, the president seemed to soften his stance considerably, as he has done previously in private, suggesting that legal status be granted to millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed serious crimes. Immigration   led by his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, have long considered such a stance â\\x80\\x9camnesty. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump never brought up the topic again  â\\x80\\x94   and didnâ\\x80\\x99t touch on his prior reference to legalizing undocumented immigrants  â\\x80\\x94   raising questions about what position heâ\\x80\\x99ll stake out in negotiations with Congress.',\n",

       " 'North Carolina Republicans are reeling after a Fourth Circuit Court Judge decided last Friday what every person on the left already knows. North Carolina s GOP implemented a series of voting reforms that are a blatant attempt to disenfranchise voters of color. On Saturday, Rev. William Barber, a respected political activist, appeared on MSNBC s A.M. Joy where he slammed North Carolina Republicans for passing these discriminatory laws.The main target of Barber s ire is North Carolina s Republican governor, Pat McCrory. McCrory, while he wasn t busy reappropriating North Carolina s disaster relief funds to fight for the right to discriminate against LGBTQ people, signed voter disenfranchisement reforms into law. He is also now trying to do everything he can to keep those laws in place, including appealing to the Supreme Court.Barber touched on this matter during the interview saying: I think the Supreme Court will leave it like it is. This was a unanimous decision. The judge who wrote the decision actually dissented when we asked for a preliminary injunction. When she received the whole record, she reviewed it and saw that this was not disparate impact, but intentional discrimination. Barber then went on to compare McCrory to the infamous racist George Wallace: The suggestion that these jurists who are above reproach are involved in some kind of conspiracy, a partisan conspiracy, you know that sounds more like some of the things that George Wallace said back in the 60 s, rather than what a 21st-century governor should be saying. As other voting rights advocates have noted, the court decision under discussion is one of the greatest anti-disenfranchisement victories in recent memory.  Given the consistently unanimous legal agreement n the matter, it is hard to believe that McCrory will get his way and continue the GOP s nefarious scheme to keep voters of color from practicing their rights as Americans.You can watch the segment below, in full.Featured image via video screen capture',\n",
       " 'GENEVA (Reuters) - The world will be in danger if Republican nominee Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the top United Nations human rights official said on Wednesday. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raâ\\x80\\x99ad al Hussein cited Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s views on vulnerable communities including minorities and his talk of authorizing torture in interrogations, banned under international law, as â\\x80\\x9cdeeply unsettling and disturbingâ\\x80\\x9d. â\\x80\\x9cIf Donald Trump is elected on the basis of what he has said already - and unless that changes - I think it is without any doubt that he would be dangerous from an international point of view,â\\x80\\x9d Zeid told a news briefing in Geneva. Trump lashed out at U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other â\\x80\\x9cdisloyalâ\\x80\\x9d Republicans on Tuesday and vowed to campaign in whatever style he wants now that the party establishment has largely abandoned him. This occurred after a 2005 video surfaced last week showing him bragging crudely about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances. Trump has said he would immediately re-authorize the waterboarding of suspected militants if elected on Nov. 8, contending that â\\x80\\x9ctorture worksâ\\x80\\x9d.  U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, signed an executive order after taking office in January 2009 that banned waterboarding and other â\\x80\\x9cenhanced interrogation techniquesâ\\x80\\x9d. Such executive orders can be rescinded by a successor. Zeid said that he would rather not interfere in political campaigns. But when a candidateâ\\x80\\x99s comments pointed to a potential use of torture, prohibited under the Convention against Torture, a pact ratified by Washington, or to vulnerable groups possibly losing their basic rights, he had to speak out. In a speech in The Hague last month, Zeid accused Trump of spreading â\\x80\\x9chumiliating racial and religious prejudiceâ\\x80\\x9d and warned of a rise of populist politics that could turn violent. â\\x80\\x9cI always believe that itâ\\x80\\x99s incumbent on leaders to lead and to lead in a way that is ethical and moral,â\\x80\\x9d Zeid said on Wednesday, when asked about Trump. â\\x80\\x9cThe use of half-truths is a very clever political device. Because as every propagandist knows, you allow the listener to fill in the rest.â\\x80\\x9d Trump has portrayed himself as tough on national security and promised to build a wall to stop Mexican immigrant â\\x80\\x9crapistsâ\\x80\\x9d from crossing the border.  â\\x80\\x9cWe have to be on guard to see that in the end vulnerable populations, populations at risk do not again see their rights deprived because of a view that is in the ascendancy based on false premises,â\\x80\\x9d Zeid said.

       " 'Home â\\x80º WORLD NEWS â\\x80º SIXTY KILLED IN NEW US-SAUDI WAR CRIME IN YEMEN SIXTY KILLED IN NEW US-SAUDI WAR CRIME IN YEMEN 0 SHARES \\n[10/31/16] The murderous and criminal character of the US-Saudi war against Yemen, the poorest country of the Middle East, was laid bare once again Sunday with the report of an air strike that claimed the lives of scores of civilians in the Red Sea port city of Al Hudaydah. \\nThe bombs struck a prison facility inside a government compound controlled by the Houthi rebel movement, which controls the north and west of the country. \\nAccording to reports from Yemen, more than 60 people were killed in the air strike, which demolished two detention centers, and at least 40 more were wounded. The Saudi warplanes used their familiar tactic of dropping bombs on the facility and then waiting for people to rush to the scene to search for survivors before bombing again to achieve the maximum death toll. \\nPrisoners and guards alike were buried in the rubble. Photographs released from the scene showed lines of bodies covered in sheets. \\nThe prison bombing, which took place at about midnight Saturday, followed close on the heels of another air strike in the western city of Taiz in the western Yemeni highlands, the countryâ\\x80\\x99s third largest population center and a major cultural center. \\nTaiz has been the scene of bitter fighting between the Houthi rebels and Saudi-backed ground forces for the past year and a half. \\nSaturdayâ\\x80\\x99s raid there targeted the al-Salw residential district near the front lines, demolishing several homes. Among those struck was the house of Abdullah Abdo, in which the US-supplied bombs dropped by Saudi jets took the lives of 11 members of the same family. Many of the victims were children. Reportedly seven of the dead were women. \\nThe air strikes Saturday were the bloodiest since October 8, when Saudi warplanes attacked a funeral home in the capital of Sanaâ\\x80\\x99a, killing and wounding at least 700 people. As many as 155 people died in that attack, which left many of the wounded without limbs and otherwise maimed. Like the latest strike on the prisons, it was a â\\x80\\x9cdouble tapâ\\x80\\x9d bombing raid, timed to ensure that those rushing to the aid of the wounded would also be killed. \\nThere is every reason to believe that this earlier attack was not a matter of collateral damage or mistaken targeting, but rather a deliberate attempt to decapitate the Houthi regime in Sanaâ\\x80\\x99a. The funeral that was hit was for the father of the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s interior minister and was attended by a number of senior officials, who lost their lives. \\nIn the aftermath of that horrific bombing, US officials issued mealy-mouthed statements to the effect that Washingtonâ\\x80\\x99s support for the Saudi war was â\\x80\\x9cnot a blank checkâ\\x80\\x9d and that it would be realigned in accordance with â\\x80\\x9cAmerican values.â\\x80\\x9d \\nSince then, US aid has continued to flow. US planes are continuing to refuel Saudi fighters in midair so that they can carry out these murderous attacks. And the US Navy has itself joined the onslaught, launching Tomahawk cruise missiles at alleged Houthi radar stations, supposedly in retaliation for missiles fired at a US warship in the Red Sea. US military officials have subsequently acknowledged doubts about the supposed missile attacks, raising the possibility that a US Navy radar malfunction had generated ghost signals. \\nJust one day before the latest atrocities carried out against the Yemeni people, both the United States and Saudi Arabia were voted onto the United Nations Human Rights Council. The elevation to this panel of the two countries most responsible for killing an estimated 10,200 Yemenis in the past year and a half, the great majority of them civilians, and pushing at least half the population to the brink of starvation serves to unmask the hypocrisy of the entire â\\x80\\x9chuman rightsâ\\x80\\x9d framework for justifying imperialist wars and interventions all over the globe.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation hinted on Wednesday that authorities in Iran had recently been trying to help locate Robert Levinson, a retired FBI agent who disappeared exactly nine years ago after traveling to an Iranian resort island to meet a fugitive from U.S. justice. â\\x80\\x9cWe are encouraged by recent cooperation between the government of Iran and the United States, and believe that our ability to locate Bob and reunite him with his family requires a shared commitment by the Iranian government,â\\x80\\x9d the FBIâ\\x80\\x99s Washington Field Office said in a prepared statement. The statement quoted FBI Director James Comey saying that his agency was â\\x80\\x9cdoing everything in our power to investigate all leads.â\\x80\\x9d  The FBI statement did not elaborate further. The White House also said that finding Levinson â\\x80\\x9cremains a top priority for the United States,â\\x80\\x9d but added that the U.S. would â\\x80\\x9ccontinue to call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide assistance in his case, as agreed to as part of the prisoner exchange finalized earlier this year.â\\x80\\x9d Five Americans were released by Iran in January to coincide with the lifting of economic sanctions in return for curbs on Tehranâ\\x80\\x99s nuclear program. The White House offered clemency to seven Iranians who were convicted or facing trial in the United States. Levinsonâ\\x80\\x99s family continued to urge the U.S. government to press Iran for his release. In a statement, Levinsonâ\\x80\\x99s wife, Christine, said: â\\x80\\x9cWeÂ\\xa0need the United States government and the country of Iran to work together to resolve what happened to Bob and return him safely to his family.â\\x80\\x9d Levinson disappeared after flying from Dubai to Kish Island in the Gulf in March 2007. There he met with Daoud Salahuddin, an American Islamic militant who fled to Iran while facing charges in the murder of an Iranian embassy official based in Washington. Levinson, working then as a private investigator, was seeking information on alleged corruption involving former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his family, said sources familiar with his work. Months after he disappeared, U.S. government sources acknowledged that Levinson also maintained an unorthodox contractual relationship with the analytical branch of the Central Intelligence Agency. A handful of CIA officials were forced out of the agency and several more were disciplined after an internal agency investigation. The Iranian government has never publicly acknowledged any role in Levinsonâ\\x80\\x99s abduction, though at the time of his disappearance a government-affiliated media outlet broadcast a story saying he was â\\x80\\x9cin the hands of Iranian security forces.â\\x80\\x9d Some FBI investigators strongly believe Levinson is still alive, while officials at other U.S. agencies believe he died some time ago.

       " 'WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s campaign has solicited advice from California regulators on how to revamp a federal regulation requiring biofuels like corn-based ethanol be blended into the nationâ\\x80\\x99s gasoline supply, according to campaign and state officials. Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 The move is the clearest sign yet that, if elected, Clinton would seek to adjust the regulation, called the Renewable Fuel Standard, possibly hurting her chances in corn-growing states like Iowa where she faces a tough battle against Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. The Renewable Fuel Standard, created by Congress in 2005, mandates that transportation fuel sold in the United States contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. It was intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions and expand the U.S. renewable fuels sector while lowering reliance on imported oil. It is opposed by the oil industry and environmentalists and has been criticized as a mere subsidy to corn producers.  Clinton advisers have contacted the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to discuss whether a policy like Californiaâ\\x80\\x99s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a market-based system rather than a mandate, could be applied at a national level to replace or augment the Renewable Fuel Standard, and other issues, CARB officials said. Mary Nichols, head of the CARB, said she discussed the stateâ\\x80\\x99s regulations with Clinton advisers. While a backer of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Nichols said she told Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s advisers they could avoid political backlash by focusing on other carbon-reduction strategies instead, such as expanding electric vehicle sales and cleaning up emissions from coal-fired electricity. Nichols did not provide further details on the discussions. A Clinton campaign official, who asked not to be named, confirmed the discussions with CARB but gave no further details.  A campaign spokesman, Tyrone Gayle, said the campaign has been seeking advice from â\\x80\\x9ca diverse set of stakeholders.â\\x80\\x9d He added that the Clinton campaign â\\x80\\x9cdoes not support replacing the RFS with a national low-carbon fuel standardâ\\x80\\x9d but did not elaborate. Former Obama administration climate and energy adviser Heather Zichal said on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last week that the Renewable Fuel Standard was broken, but that a Clinton administration could make â\\x80\\x9cmodificationsâ\\x80\\x9d to fix it. â\\x80\\x9cMandates arenâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily a perfect way to regulate,â\\x80\\x9d Zichal said at the event. The U.S. corn lobby hopes to convince both Clinton and Trump to uphold the regulation, which requires a doubling of U.S. biofuels use to 36 billion gallons per year by 2022, when congressionally mandated volume targets are set to expire. The program is designed to last indefinitely after that. Environmentalists, anti-hunger activists and the oil sector have called for the rule to be repealed or changed because they say it raises food and fuel costs without delivering the emissions reductions that it was intended to achieve. MARKET-BASED SYSTEM The California regulation, a key part of the stateâ\\x80\\x99s effort to combat climate change, requires a 10 percent reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 2020, but leaves it up to companiesÂ\\xa0to decide how to reach that target. Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 California enacted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in 2007 targeting oil refiners and distributors that sell in the stateâ\\x80\\x99s market. It angered Midwestern ethanol interests because the regulation counts the carbon dioxide footprint of transporting biofuels into the state for blending, effectively blocking many of those imports. Oil companies have complained that the regulation is costly. Clinton in May expressed support for the federal Renewable Fuel Standard in an opinion piece published in an Iowa newspaper, but said it could be improved. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s openness to overhauling the Renewable Fuel Standard appears to contrast with Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s position. During the state-by-state battle for the Republican presidential nomination, Trump said he supported the biofuel mandates set out in the Renewable Fuel Standard. Corn and ethanol industry lobbyists said they have been talking with both the Clinton and Trump campaigns to argue in favor of the Renewable Fuel Standard. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI chief James Comey will likely hold back from accusing President Donald Trump of trying to interfere with an  investigation into links between Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s election campaign team and Russian officials when he testifies in Congress this week, legal sources said. Comeyâ\\x80\\x99s highly anticipated appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday could be a turning point in a controversy that has rocked Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s young administration. In his first public remarks since Trump fired him last month, Comey is expected to tell the Senate Intelligence committee that Trump asked him during a meeting in the Oval Office to end the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ\\x80\\x99s probe into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia. Comey may also detail other conversations with Trump.  Two legal experts said Comey would seek to avoid compromising a new inquiry led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller or separate congressional investigations. â\\x80\\x9cI would expect him to hew pretty closely to facts and events,â\\x80\\x9d said Jack Sharman, a partner at Lightfoot, Franklin and White and former special counsel to a congressional committee that investigated President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Another source, who asked not to be named, said Comey does not see it as his role to charge the president or anyone else with obstruction of justice or any other crime. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, but to affect the electionâ\\x80\\x99s outcome. Comey told the House of Representatives intelligence committee on March 20 that the FBI was probing Moscowâ\\x80\\x99s role in the election, including possible Trump campaign collusion. Trump fired Comey on May 9, a step that stunned Washington and intensified scrutiny of the matter. Michael Flynn, Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s national security adviser, was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about contacts Flynn had with Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. Federal prosecutors last month issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen.  The Senate intelligence panel also issued its first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. The first roughly 600 pages of those documents were delivered on Tuesday.

       " 'Trae Crowder, known on YouTube as  The Liberal Redneck,  has returned again with yet another damned funny commentary on the recent creepy obsession that Republicans have with what people do in public restrooms.Crowder started by taking aim specifically at the new wave of idiots that are invading Target department stores, in order to loudly  protest  the fact they allow transgender people to use the restrooms in their department stores. One case in particular was one where a woman was walking up and down the aisles in target, towing along what appeared to be half of her 12 children she claimed to have.Sympathizing with the woman, in the comedic sense, he said he could understand how with 12 kids she was  crazier than Michelle Bachmann on bath salts.  You gotta agree with his logic. With 12 kids, and having to manage them in a militant Christian household that you KNOW she runs, she s probably crazier than an outhouse rat.Crowder is sick of hearing about how Republicans are going to  take their country back  as well, and suggested that they all move somewhere that religion and government are the same   like Saudi Arabia. Crowder said I know what you re thinking    Eww, they re brown, gross. But check it out: they love screaming, they hate books, they throw rocks at queers   you d fit right in.  What a great point. Right?Watch Trae completely own every person who can t stop thinking about people peeing below:Considering how many Republicans get caught doing bad hings in public rest rooms, you would think that they d be focusing more on their own party, instead of an entire segment of society that already lives in such fear of going to the bathroom they are in-and-out while drawing as little attention to themselves as possible.Featured image via video screen capture ',\n",

       " 'Georgia s Republican governor Nathan Deal stirred up a hornet s nest of controversy when comments he made referring to black Americans as  colored people  surfaced on Wednesday night.Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) went after opponents of an education ballot measure known as Amendment 1 in a speech last month, saying if they wanted to help  colored people,  this measure was a good place to start. The irony of some of the groups who are opposing doing something to help these minority children is beyond my logic. If you want to advance the state of colored people, start with their children,  Deal said in an Oct. 3 speech, Fox 5 in Atlanta reported Wednesday.Deal told a local news station that he meant to reference the NAACP, and didn t mean to say  colored people,  which is a dubious claim at best.The governor is a former member of congress who once wrote a formal letter to the Obama White House to formally raise questions about President Obama s place of birth as part of the birther conspiracy theory.Many have pointed out that the birther conspiracy is steeped in racist attitudes about the presidency and President Obama being the first black president, who was quickly challenged to present papers verifying his place of birth (it is Hawaii).Deal s comments come precisely when Republicans are still being forced to grapple with their presidential nominee Donald Trump s blatant embrace of racism. Trump s bigoted push has emboldened cells of white supremacists, who see their beliefs reflected in his words. That includes former Klansman David Duke, who is now a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana. And on the same night Deal s comments were publicized, Duke took part in a debate at a historically black university. Within the Republican Party, Duke has attracted a small following, but enough to qualify him for the debate stage.Featured image via screen capture',\n",
       " \"When you think of civil rights activists, it s not likely that Glenn Beck will ever enter your conscious, except perhaps as a cautionary tale. It does seem, though, that he s had a moment of clarity, even an epiphany. The man who has played a large part in demonizing Black Lives Matter finally gets it. At least he gets part of it. He gets why  All Lives Matter  is a really bad response.In the past, Beck has been especially critical of Black Lives Matter, who he accused of inciting  terrorism. Beck s comments were sparked by discussion over Black Lives Matter protesters  recent invasion of a Dartmouth College library, where the activists harassed white students, calling one girl a  filthy white bitch. They are terrorizing you,  Beck said of the incident.  What do you think that is when   when one of the girls, who supported Black Lives Matter at Dartmouth. And she was in the library, and she was studying. And they pulled her out of her seat.   She started crying. Beck said filling people with  fear  is the  first step to terrorism. I think we need to start calling it that,  Beck concluded.  We need to start being very, very clear. In the past, he even led a march for  All Lives Matter.  Things have changed somewhat, though, at least for Beck. While he s still not officially a Black Lives Matter supporter, he understands why All Lives Matter is stupid. In a news conference covered by the Washington Post, Beck relayed this analogy: All of us are sitting around a table, and we re all friends,  he said.  It s time for dessert, and everybody gets pie except for me and you. And you say,  I didn t get any pie.  Everybody at the table looks at you and says  I know. All pie matters.  You say,  but I don t have any pie! What about my pie?' Beck still says that the leaders of Black Lives Matter are  communists and anti-capitalists,  but he says that most supporters are not and that we really need to learn to speak to each other.For that, some conservatives are throwing Beck under the bus. Blue Lives Matter accused Beck of pandering to Black Lives Matter.Breitbart.com, whose CEO was just named Trump s campaign CEO, didn t like Beck s analogy either: While Glenn Beck would like people to believe he s insightful, critics of Black Lives Matter don t need his hectoring,  wrote Breitbart s Lee Stranahan, who is also based in Dallas.  The reason many people   including black critics of Black Lives Matter like [Milwaukee County] Sheriff David Clarke   say  All Lives Matter  in response to  Black Lives Matter  is to reject the underlying notion of identity politics. Beck is not a supporter of Trump. Is this a sign that the #NeverTrump movement can bring out a more rational right-wing? Conservatives are certainly in the midst of an existential crisis and many of them appear to be soul searching. Whether Beck has dug deep enough to find his soul or whether he happened to get his meds right that day will be sorted out over time, but for now, it s refreshing to hear someone on the right *sort of* get it.Featured image via J.

       " 'President Obama made his final appearance as the sitting president at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation s annual dinner, and made it very clear he will not be sitting on the sidelines for the coming election.The President said,  we have something to teach him  in response to Trump s claims that black voters have  nothing to lose  so they should vote for him.President Obama: \"You want to give me a good send off? Go vote!\" https://t.co/2TggidWndx https://t.co/iCke8GsuCo  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 18, 2016From the White House press pool report: But our progress is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that is on the ballot right now. And there is one candidate who will advance those things, and there is another candidate who s defining principle, the central theme of his candidacy  is opposing those things, Obama said. I will consider it a personal insult  if African Americans sit out this election. If you want to give mea a good send off, go vote! Hope is on the ballot and fear is on the ballot too. Obama also spoke about Republican efforts to block voter turnout by requiring obstacles like voter ID, noting,  We are the only democracy in the world actively trying to discourage voting. Obama also joked with the crowd about Donald Trump finally admitting that he was born in the United States: I mean ISIL, North Korea, poverty, climate change-none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate. According to the White House press pool, supporters lined up along the street chanted  four more years  as the President and First Lady left the venue.Trump has faced huge obstacles in attempting to attract black voters to his campaign. Already skeptical of Republicans, Trump has a history that turns them off. In addition to being part of a redlining effort in his father s real estate business that tried to keep blacks out of apartments, Trump also called for the execution of the Central Park Five after it was proven they were innocent, and promoted the false racist birther conspiracy up until a few months ago   even after President Obama had long since provided his birth certificate.Featured image via screen capture',\n",
       " 'A group of about 1,000 Christians planned to attend next week s Reason Rally in Washington, D.C., so they could hand out literature and about $25,000 in Subway gift cards. The purpose was to show the atheists that would be there some so-called  Christian love.  However, the D.C. police have put a stop to that, saying they would have to get a separate permit, and stay on the other side of the National Mall, because such a gathering constitutes a protest.Organizer Ray Comfort told Christian NewsWire the following: In what is so often a cruel world, we tried to show a little kindness and it didn t work. So it now looks like we will be eating Subway sandwiches for the next 40 years. Oh, no. What to do, what to do? Comfort will still be allowed to film the event, because his film crew is too small to need a permit. Since the Reason Rally is free and open to the public, Comfort is now encouraging Christians to go as individuals, and not as a group, so they can still proselytize to the atheists there. That s their M.O.   force their religion down the throats of anyone who doesn t believe in any way possible.While Comfort can understand the perspective of the police they re trying to maintain peace there s a solid chance that there will be Christians there who don t get it at all, and only see their so-called  mission from God,  to convert these heathens. For instance, Eric Hovind, writing on Creation Today, said: On June 4, 2016 we will be gathering in Washington, D.C. to share the love of Christ with a group of people who practice the religion of Selfianity. That s right, they self identify as  Atheists  in order to become worshipers of themselves. Oh, please. Hovind is one of those that thinks atheists (and other non-Christians) are the root of what s wrong with the world. He won t be the only one there to think that way, either.Hovind calls his blog post  REASON hits the Reason Rally 2016,  in a lame attempt to demonstrate that Christianity is the only reason there is. He s one of those that will probably end up hounding the atheists that attend.There is one good thing to come out of this. Some readers of The Friendly Atheist were able to convince Ray Comfort to give those Subway gift cards to the homeless. That there is true Christian love   helping the downtrodden. They need to spend more time doing that, and less time trying to convert people to their religion and taking over the country.Featured image by Brambmanu.

       " 'Religious rights in Obama s America don t apply to Christians or Jews they only apply to Muslims.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission won $240,000 in damages for two Muslim truck drivers after it sued their former employer for religious discrimination for firing the drivers for refusing to make beer deliveries.The EEOC said that Star Transport Inc., a trucking company based in Morton, Ill., violated their religious rights by refusing to accommodate their objections to delivering alcoholic beverages. EEOC is proud to support the rights of workers to equal treatment in the workplace without having to sacrifice their religious beliefs or practices,  EEOC General Counsel David Lopez announced Thursday.  This is fundamental to the American principles of religious freedom and tolerance. The case involved Star Transport s firing of drivers Mahad Abass Mohamed and Abdkiarim Hassan Bulshale, both of Somali heritage, in 2009 after they refused to make beer deliveries for the company, citing their adherence to Islamic law. For devout Muslims, consuming or even being in contact with any alcoholic beverage is prohibited.The EEOC argued that the company could have easily reassigned the drivers but did not and sued it for religious discrimination. Star Transport admitted liability in March. The jury awarded Mohamed and Bulshale $20,000 each in compensatory damages and $100,000 each in punitive damages. The judge awarded each about $1,500 in back pay.

       " 'PRETORIA (Reuters) - South African President Jacob Zuma has asked the High Court to reject a call by an anti-corruption watchdog for an official inquiry into alleged influence-peddling in his government. A report a year ago by South Africa s anti-graft agency known as Public Protector recommended a judicial probe be held to look into allegations of systemic corruption by Zuma, some of his ministers and heads of state-owned companies. The report focused on allegations that Zuma s friends, businessman brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers. The 75-year-old Zuma, whose rule has long been dogged by scandal, and the Gupta brothers have denied the accusations. The president, who previously described the  State of Capture  report as  unfair  in parliament, wants the court to send it back to the watchdog for further investigations. He questioned the right of the report s author, Public Protector former head Thuli Madonsela, to call for a judicial inquiry. The report, whose public release Zuma had sought to block through the courts, called for an inquiry be set up by the president and for a judge to be appointed within 30 days of its release.  Is she competent to then direct the president to hold a commission on inquiry? With respect to this submission, she s not,  Zuma s lawyer Ishmael Semenya told the court, referring to Madonsela. The hearing is expected to continue until Thursday and a ruling is expected at a later date. Zuma this year faced a series of corruption allegations, most recently over leaked emails that suggest the Gupta brothers may have used their influence to secure state contracts for their companies. Zuma and the Gupta brothers have denied these allegations. Separately, Zuma is facing the possibility of more court charges. The Supreme Court this month upheld a High Court ruling to reinstate 783 corruption charges filed against him before he became president in 2009. The National Prosecuting Authority is expected to make a decision on whether to charge Zuma. ',\n",

That just makes you a good person,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Cohen added. When a friend betrays you by, say, blabbing your secrets or being consistently cruel, you can and should stand up for yourself. And if this is not one of your closest friends, a breakup is most likely in order. The goal in these instances is to be honest and plainly explain why you canâ\\x80\\x99t be friends with someone you donâ\\x80\\x99t trust. And have the conversation live  â\\x80\\x94   either in person or over the phone  â\\x80\\x94   because anything you write online could be shared or used against you in a way you may regret. But when you have a major conflict with a best friend, these scenarios donâ\\x80\\x99t apply. Itâ\\x80\\x99s ideal to have an open discussion about your feelings. â\\x80\\x9cFor those friends, itâ\\x80\\x99s worth it to try harder and give the person the benefit of the doubt because those relationships are rare,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Cohen said. â\\x80\\x9cBe really honest about whatâ\\x80\\x99s going on. â\\x80\\x9d If after that, the relationship still feels unsustainable to you, let your friend go as gently as you can. â\\x80\\x9cThese relationships need to be mutually satisfying to both people,â\\x80\\x9d Dr. Levine said. Be clear that you wish your friend well but resist the urge to explain every detail of your thought process. â\\x80\\x9cIt isnâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily kind and wonâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily provide the other person with closure. Your friend will still need to achieve that on her own,â\\x80\\x9d Dr. Levine added. And remember that friendship breakups can hurt just as much as romantic breakups, especially if youâ\\x80\\x99ve been close with a friend for a long time. And sadly, noted Dr. Levine, â\\x80\\x9cwhen you break up with a boyfriend, you can turn to your best friends for support.

       " 'In a desperate bid to normalize the Republican Party s insane stance on keeping Scalia s seat on the Supreme Court empty, a new talking point is being tried out by conservatives: There s no time limit in the Constitution, and there s nothing magical about there being nine justices, [Dean] Reuter said during a panel meeting at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). The country started out with six justices, we ve had as many as ten at some point in time,  he continued.  As recently as 2010, when Justice Elena Kagan came on the Court, she had been solicitor general so she recused herself in over a third of the cases (so) I don t see a sense of urgency. I fully expect this to be repeated over and over again and eventually mimicked by the corporate media. If there s one thing besides crippling America that the GOP is really good at, it s making their sabotage seem perfectly normal. The corporate media is always a willing accomplice to this charade as they will tie themselves into knots to avoid calling out the historic extremism of the right.A side benefit of using this kind of rhetoric to keep the 9th seat empty for so long is that when a Democrat wins in November, they ll already have normalized a reduced Court. It s like stacking the Court, adding seats to dilute the power of one set of Justices, but in reverse.On the flip side, if Republicans were to somehow win in November, I wouldn t be at all surprised if they suddenly  realized  that 9 Justices just aren t enough and we really should have 11, 7 of whom would just happen to be conservative. For a group that calls themselves  conservatives,  ostensibly the party that preserves the status quo, the American right wing has zero interest in preserving tradition, precedent or the Constitution. They re only interested in preserving their own power at any expense.Featured image via Rational Politics',\n",

       " 'Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz must really be getting nervous about his chances of snatching the GOP nomination from front runner Donald Trump   because he s warning conservative voters that if they don t switch over to team Cruz, they re basically handing the election to Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton.Cruz made these comments during a radio interview on WPHT-AM Wednesday. In speaking to host Chris Stigall, Cruz suggested that if voters were going to be stupid enough to nominate Trump to run against Clinton, they  might as well  just hand her the White House on a silver platter. Cruz said: We have got to win and if Donald Trump is the nominee, it elects Hillary Clinton. Every vote for Donald Trump is a vote for Hillary Clinton. You might as well put a Hillary sticker on your car because Hillary wins by double-digits against Donald Trump. Cruz is absolutely right about one thing   and that s the fact that Clinton would sweep the debate floor with Trump, and right now she s destroying him in the polls. There is no way the disgraced candidate and business mogul would even stand a chance against her. But then Cruz begins to add some good old conservative wishful thinking to his rant, and reveals that HE is a good enough candidate to beat the former Secretary of State (even though he s currently losing to Trump). Cruz said: I beat Hillary in the election and that s why Republicans are coming together and are uniting behind a positive, optimistic, conservative message to bring back jobs and economic growth, to defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights and to keep America safe and defeat radical Islamic terrorists. Of course the Republican party is uniting under Cruz   they know how dangerous Trump is for the GOP and will do anything to stop him at this point. But unfortunately, they still haven t come to terms with the fact that the Democrats are going to have this election whether they like it or not. At this point, conservatives are desperate and they re grasping at straws.You can listen to Cruz s threats in the interview below:Both Trump and Cruz are no match for Clinton or Sanders, and they ve spent most of this campaign cycle making each other look like fools.

       " 'NAIROBI (Reuters) - Administrators closed Kenya s oldest university on Tuesday, citing fears for students  safety in a planned protest over police beatings at a campus demonstration last week. Kenyan police frequently face accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings from civilians and rights groups, but officers are rarely charged and almost never convicted.  Despite this, Kenya, an economic and transport hub in East Africa and a key Western ally in a volatile region, receives substantial financial support for its security services from international donors, including the United States and Britain.   Rights groups say at least 28 people were killed, mostly by police, in unrest following the Aug. 8 election, whose results were later nullified by the Supreme Court due to irregularities.  A re-run of the presidential vote is scheduled for Oct. 26 and the conduct of the police will be closely watched.  On Sept. 28, University of Nairobi students protested against the arrest of an opposition lawmaker. Police responded by entering dormitories and classrooms, dragging out students, beating them with clubs and firing tear gas, according to a Reuters witness. The university said 27 students were injured.  A police spokesman did not respond to requests for comment but a presidential spokesman told local radio on Monday that robbers were hiding among the students.  On Tuesday, students had planned to demonstrate against the beatings but instead administrators shut down the university.   The (University of Nairobi) Senate has decided to send the students home for their (own) safety,  John Orindi, the university s corporate affairs director, told Reuters. On Tuesday morning, riot policemen stood near a truck with water cannon outside the campus gates.  A 20-year-old veterinary student who did not want to be named for fear of retribution said students wanted the vice chancellor to resign  for allowing anti-riot police to enter campus and seriously injure students . University officials had talks on Monday with the interior minister, police chief and the head of a Kenyan government watchdog that is charged with investigating complaints against the police. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday escalated a fight with Fox News, using the word â\\x80\\x9cbimboâ\\x80\\x9d in a derogatory tweet about anchorwoman Megyn Kelly after pulling out of a debate only days before the first nominating contest of the 2016 campaign. Trump on Tuesday withdrew from the televised encounter, scheduled for Thursday night in Des Moines, Iowa, in irritation at host Fox News (FOXA.O) for allowing Kelly to moderate after her questioning angered him in a debate last year.     The real estate magnate, who is the Republican front-runner to win the nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, followed up with another round of insults on Wednesday. â\\x80\\x9cI refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote on Twitter. â\\x80\\x9cInstead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!â\\x80\\x9d In a later interview on Fox Newsâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cThe Oâ\\x80\\x99Reilly Factor,â\\x80\\x9d he told host Bill Oâ\\x80\\x99Reilly that she was â\\x80\\x9chighly overrated.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI have zero respect for Megyn Kelly. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think sheâ\\x80\\x99s very good at what she does,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Republican presidential rivals were quick to criticize the former reality TV star, with U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas blistering him in a series of tweets and accusing him of â\\x80\\x9ctrembling at being questioned by Kelly.â\\x80\\x9d At an event in West Des Moines, Iowa, Cruz openly mocked Trump, calling him a â\\x80\\x9cfragile soulâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cgentle,â\\x80\\x9d and renewed his offer to debate Trump one-on-one Saturday evening. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not that heâ\\x80\\x99s afraid of me,â\\x80\\x9d Cruz said to the crowd. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s afraid of you. He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want to answer questions from the men and women of Iowa about how his record doesnâ\\x80\\x99t match what heâ\\x80\\x99s selling.â\\x80\\x9d Another Republican hopeful, U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, told Fox News that he welcomed Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s absence from the debate stage because it means â\\x80\\x9cwe donâ\\x80\\x99t have to put up with a lot of empty blather and boastfulness and calling people names.â\\x80\\x9d Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s decision means the last televised debate before Mondayâ\\x80\\x99s Iowa caucuses - which kick off the state-by-state nominating race to choose candidates for the presidential election - will not feature the man who has dominated the Republican race for months and leads many opinion polls. It was seen as a bold gamble. Trump has said that in lieu of his debate participation he will hold a fundraiser for veterans. It will be held at Drake University in Des Moines and begin at the same time Thursday as the Fox debate, according to an invitation his campaign circulated Wednesday evening.  â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a risky move; itâ\\x80\\x99s very high profile,â\\x80\\x9d said Craig Robinson, a former Iowa state party official. â\\x80\\x9cBut Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure  it will really change anyoneâ\\x80\\x99s mind about Trump.â\\x80\\x9d        Trump has been feuding with Fox News since the network hosted the first Republican debate in August, in which Kelly asked Trump about his treatment of women, prompting a stream of insults from the candidate and complaints he was not being treated fairly. He did not renew his attacks on Kelly during an evening rally in Gilbert, South Carolina, but told supporters to watch a rerun of the Fox interview, which he called a â\\x80\\x9ctough interview,â\\x80\\x9d when they got home. Cruz, Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s main rival in Iowa, used the hashtag #DuckingDonald to make fun of Trump for ducking out of the debate and tweeted a mocked-up picture of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s head on Scrooge McDuckâ\\x80\\x99s body sitting on a pile of money. Cruz, a conservative and a debating champion in college, tweeted a link to â\\x80\\x9cduckingdonald.com,â\\x80\\x9d which asked visitors to sign a petition in favor of Cruz and Trump having a side debate. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, another Republican presidential contender, described Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s decision at such a crucial time as â\\x80\\x9ca big mistakeâ\\x80\\x9d that calls into question his ability to be president. â\\x80\\x9cAnytime you get a podium and a microphone and 15-20 million people watching in an election campaign, you should take it,â\\x80\\x9d Christie told Boston Herald Radio. Another Republican candidate, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, said he wanted to focus on keeping the party united in order to beat Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, if she becomes the Democratic nominee. â\\x80\\x9cThese kinds of theatrics by Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are an entertaining sideshow, but they have nothing to do with defeating Hillary Clinton,â\\x80\\x9d Rubio said. Not every candidate was convinced Trump would follow through on his pledge to stay away. â\\x80\\x9cHe apparently is not going to come to the debate, although Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got a $20 bet heâ\\x80\\x99ll show up,â\\x80\\x9d former Florida Governor Jeb Bush said at a town hall meeting in response to a question. â\\x80\\x9cPoor little Donald, being treated unfairly,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said Trump was not afraid to debate his rivals or take reportersâ\\x80\\x99 questions. He added that Trump would be happy to debate Cruz if the contest, in which 12 Republicans are vying for their partyâ\\x80\\x99s nomination, narrows.  â\\x80\\x9cIf it comes down to a two-person race, Donald Trump would be happy to debate him,â\\x80\\x9d Lewandowski told ABCâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cGood Morning Americaâ\\x80\\x9d program. Fox News, in a statement on Tuesday, said it would not â\\x80\\x9cgive in to terrorizations toward any of our employees,â\\x80\\x9d but left the door open to Trump attending the debate. The event will be co-hosted by Alphabet Incâ\\x80\\x99s (GOOGL.O) Google.              â\\x80\\x9cAt the end of the day, Mr. Trump is going to have the last laugh,â\\x80\\x9d Lewandowski told MSNBC.

       " 'Email \\nThe various communities in the state of J & K â\\x80\\x93 Kashmiri Muslims, Kashmiri Pandits, Dogras and Ladakhis â\\x80\\x93 have tried time and again to form a national consciousness in order to name a cultural alterity through the nation. The construction of â\\x80\\x9cKashmiriyat,â\\x80\\x9d or a syncretic cultural ethos, by Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and his comrades involved culling selected cultural fragments from an imagined past that would enfold both the Pandits and the Muslims. But due to the regional sentiments that are so well entrenched in the psyche of the people, this attempt is still in a volatile stage. \\nThe notion of â\\x80\\x9cKashmiriyat,â\\x80\\x9d forged by my maternal grandfather Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, was not handed down to me as an unachievable and abstract construct; on the contrary, it was crystallized for me as the eradication of a feudal structure and its insidious ramifications; the right of the tiller to the land he worked on; the unacceptability of any political solution that did not take the aspirations and demands of the Kashmiri people into consideration; the right of Kashmiris to high offices in education, the bureaucracy and government; the availability of medical and educational facilities in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh; the preservation of literatures, shrines and historical artifacts that defined an important aspect of â\\x80\\x9cKashmiriyatâ\\x80\\x9d; formation of the Constituent Assembly of J & K to institutionalize the constitution of the state in 1951, which was an enormous leap toward the process of democratization; the fundamental right of both women and men to free education up to the university level; equal opportunities afforded to both sexes in the workplace; the nurturing of a contact zone in social, political and intellectual ideologies and institutions; pride in a cultural identity that was generated in a space created by multiple perspectives. \\nThe notion of â\\x80\\x98Kashmiriyatâ\\x80\\x99, or of the syncretism of Kashmir, as I mentioned earlier, was the secular credo of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullahâ\\x80\\x99s All Jammu and Kashmir NC, popularized in the 1940s and 50s to defeat the centralizing strategies of the successive regimes of independent India. This significant concept does not attempt to simplify the ambiguity and complexity of religious, social and cultural identities. It neither attempts to assert a fixed identity nor reinforce the idea of purity of culture. I would veer away from adopting an image of this secular credo that is created by the unitary discourses it deplores. On the contrary, â\\x80\\x9cKashmiriyatâ\\x80\\x9d brings about a metamorphosis in the determinate concept of the Indian state, and creates a situation in which the nation-states of India and Pakistan are forced to confront an alternative epistemology. At a time of political and social upheaval in the state, this notion engendered a consciousness of place that offered a critical perspective from which to formulate alternatives. Without negating the historicity of the notion, this theoretical fiction was deployed by Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and his colleagues in order to forge a strategic essentialism that would enable the creation of a sovereign Kashmiri identity. It certainly was not a flawless notion. Professor R. L. Hangloo, eminent historian of Kashmiri Pandit descent provided a complex and concise definition of â\\x80\\x9c Kashmiriyat â\\x80\\x9d: \\nâ\\x80\\x9c Kashmiriyat is a far wider concept than the harmonious relationship cutting across religious and sectarian divisions. Kashmiriyat is the externally endowed and internally evolved phenomenon of co-existence at the social, religious, political, spatial, cultural and other institutional levels among Kashmirees of all shades that inhabited Kashmir. Kashmiriyat has evolved as a result of special circumstances that are rooted in Kashmirâ\\x80\\x98s topographical centrality that entitled Kashmir to imbibing, interacting and assimilating a variety of world cultures in consonance with Kashmiri sensibilities that reflect a nuanced and sophisticated approach that did not disturb the patterns of production and cultural manners reflecting the Kashmiri genius. This specificity has stemmed from the historical processes that the region of Kashmir has embraced both in peace and turmoil for centuries. Kashmir has always been surrounded by some of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s greatest civilizations such as China, Persia/Iran, Central Asia and India. Kashmir and Kashmirees were always at the center of this world and not on the periphery which is reflected in the assimilation of their residual practices of religions. Note that while Kashmir maybe on a fairly marginal point on the map of the state of India, Kashmir as a region was historically at the epicenter of a much larger world space and world civilization. This centrality endowed the region with a superiority and self identity that has assimilated the social and religious-cultural traditions of this greater region and traits of greater cultures throughout history to evolve and strengthen what came to constitute Kashmiriyat . This sense of superior self identity has grown over centuries as Kashmiriyat among Kashmirees both within and out side Kashmir. \\nLiving together, untroubled by diversities of religion, racial, cultural, material, and political and other identities, the notion of Kashmiriyat became the bedrock of identity which consolidated itself increasingly when Islam entered into the Valley. Before the thirteenth century, even though there were plural religious sects, they neither saw eye to eye with each other nor were they external to Kashmir in totality. Shaivites facilitated the decline of Buddhists in Kashmir; the Vaishnavas had to keep their identity concealed to escape the wrath of the Shaivites. The pre-Islamic history is replete with religious, ethnic, racial and other conflicts. The battles of Dammaras, Ekangas, Tantrins, Khasas and others were perpetual features of pre-Islamic Kashmiri society. There was a long drawn conflict and contestation within Islamic society before rapprochement took place between the orthodox Muslims and heterodox sects. The entrance of Islam in Kashmir coincided with the end of this struggle. It was this rapprochement that disallowed Kashmirees from seeing any contradiction between the preaching of Islam and the practice of upholding the Heretical tradition (that is, acknowledging the divine power of the local, the Rishi) in Kashmir. Therefore the kind of Islam that entered Kashmir was devoid of any orthodoxy. It was only after the arrival of Islam that Lalleshwari and Sheikh Noor â\\x80\\x93ud-din (Nund Reshi) interacted to produce the atmosphere and philosophy of co-existence and tolerance at popular level. This interaction entailed massive changes in the world view of Kashmirees that reflected a truly remarkable and world encompassing shift in every aspect of their sensibility as well.â\\x80\\x9d \\nUncertainty about the status of the former princely state has loomed large since 1947. In an atmosphere of unpredictability, in the frightening darkness of political intrigue, in the paranoia of political deception, the fungi of undemocratic policies and methods continue to grow unabated. The unresolved Kashmir dispute poses a danger of monstrous proportions to the stability of the Indian subcontinent. Is the former princely state of J & K a postcolonial state? Postcolonialism refers to a phase undergone after the decline and dismantling of the European empires by the mid-twentieth century, when the peoples of many Asian, African and Caribbean countries were left to create new governments and forge national identities. The ideology that has been propounded by the governments of India and Pakistan reflects and produces the interests of state-sponsored agencies and institutionson both sides of the Line of Control (LOC). These institutions have couched the debased discourse of exploitation in the language of culture and religion, a strategy that has led to the relegation of the subjectivity, historical understanding and traditions of the Kashmiri populace. As the eminent Palestinianâ\\x80\\x93American scholar Edward Said (1991: 29) noted, â\\x80\\x9cAll human activity depends on controlling a radically unstable reality to which words approximate only by will or convention.â\\x80\\x9d Representatives of the privileged centre of power silence the voices that are on the margins of mainstream society and politics. These privileged centres have always constrained reality by imposing their ideological schema, which underpins their powerful positionality, on it. Their ability to conjure images and re-stretch boundaries that serve their set of beliefs has rendered them a force to reckon with. These ideas expounded by the powers-that-be portray Kashmiris as a stereotypical and predictable entity. \\nThis delineation of the Kashmiri subject was foregrounded by an imperial agent of the British Raj, Sir Walter Lawrence, Settlement Commissioner of J & K, in his The Vale of Kashmir ([1895] 2005). This politically and culturally misleading portrayal of the Kashmiri subject has been underscored by the policies of the governments of India and Pakistan vis-Ã\\xa0-vis Jammu and Kashmir, which is why the authority of democratically elected representatives in that region has always been curbed. The policies of the two governments follow the much-trodden path of totalitarianism and spell a pattern of doom for Kashmir. The unnecessary and unjustified postponement of the resolution of the Kashmir conflict has insidiously gnawed at the tenuous relations between India and Pakistan. The issue has also, for better or worse, been thrust on to the stage of global politics, and its volatility has contributed to the destabilization of the Indian subcontinent. Josef Korbel (2002: 304) wrote with foresight that â\\x80\\x9cwhatever the future may have in store, the free world shares with India and Pakistan common responsibility for the fate of democracy and it awaits with trepidation the solution of the Kashmir problem. Its own security may depend on such a settlement.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

He explains:Anti-Trumpers Block Highway; Face Class Actions For DamagesSuits Filed re Blocked GW Bridge Provide Precedenthttps://t.co/LN17FGakCw  John Banzhaf (@ProfBanzhaf) March 19, 2016Why and How to Sue Anti-Trump Protesters and Other Disruptors\"Sue The Disruptors\" More Effective Than Criminal Lawhttps://t.co/9MMiZtE5wq  John Banzhaf (@ProfBanzhaf) March 21, 2016As Banzhaf had predicted and later helped inspire, two different class action law suits seeking millions in civil damages were brought by persons stuck in the massive traffic jams at NYC s GW Bridge which were illegally caused by former aides to Governor Chris Christie.Suing protesters    Suing the Bastards    may be the most effective way to help deter illegal protests, says Banzhaf, noting that slap-on-the-wrist criminal fines usually aren t very effective, especially since it sometimes also helps give illegal protesters a soap box to air their grievances in criminal trials.The lead protester who chained her neck to a pickup truck was George Soros paid operative, Jacinta Gonzalez from New Orleans.But the tide may already be turning, says Banzhaf, citing these examples.When other groups see that the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has been forced to pay $2.55 million to Japanese companies for illegally using acid and smoke bombs to disrupt their whaling, they may think twice before blocking traffic to advance their agenda, says Banzhaf, who has promoted the idea   and the very slogan   of  Suing the Bastards  when the law is broken.In another example, a student who illegally chained himself to some construction equipment because he opposed an oil pipeline was forced to pay out big bucks for his criminal conduct.As NPR reported it, he was apparently ready to accept a relatively painless conviction for trespass, but not to pay the pipeline company $39,000 in restitution.Similarly, eleven protesters who allegedly engaged in illegal activities at the Mall of American are facing restitution claims from the City of Bloomington.In these and many similar situations, protesters are often willing to accept a small misdemeanor fine and conviction for a chance to focus attention on their cause, especially if it means they get to have a criminal trial which generates even more publicity for them and for their grievance, argues Banzhaf.While most of these actions against criminal protesters have been brought by businesses, there s no reason why similar legal actions cannot also be brought by any person falsely imprisoned on that Arizona highway   as was the case with one of the two GW-Bridge suits.Using the threat of legal actions is a far better and more American way of deterring illegal protests than engaging in physical violence against them, as some Trump supporters have apparently already done, says Banzhaf.Via: PRLOG',\n",

       " 'BERLIN (Reuters) - German industry associations on Friday criticized U.S. President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s decision to withdraw from a landmark agreement to fight climate change, warning that the move would harm the global economy and lead to market distortions. Trump said on Thursday the United States would withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate deal, a move that fulfilled a major campaign pledge but drew condemnation from global leaders and executives. He said his administration would begin talks either to re-enter the Paris accord or to have a new deal with better terms for the United States. â\\x80\\x9cTrumpâ\\x80\\x99s climate refusal harms the economy,â\\x80\\x9d said Thilo Brodtmann, Managing Director of Germanyâ\\x80\\x99s VDMA engineering industry association, adding that Trump was â\\x80\\x9cputting campaign promises over the long-term interests of the world community.â\\x80\\x9d This would harm the economy as well as the environment, since the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can go hand in hand with economic growth if companies have planning certainty for investing in efficient technologies, he added. â\\x80\\x9cEurope and its allies, as well as important federal states and companies in the U.S., must now hold their course,â\\x80\\x9d Brodtmann said. In the long term, Europe would profit from its investment in climate-friendly technologies. Germanyâ\\x80\\x99s DIHK Chambers of Commerce warned that some U.S. companies could gain short-term advantages by Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s decision to pull out of the climate deal.  â\\x80\\x9cClimate protection can be pushed forward in an effective and competition-friendly way only by all states,â\\x80\\x9d said DIHK President Eric Schweitzer. Schweitzer said other countries should stick to their commitments, but warned that attempting to compensate for the U.S. withdrawal by other countries redoubling their commitments would be self-defeating.

       " 'Just a few days after being sworn in as president, Donald J. Trump convened a meeting at the White House of some of the nationâ\\x80\\x99s most prominent chief executives to discuss how to improve manufacturing. Mr. Trump was joined by Elon Musk of Tesla, Mark Fields of Ford, Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical, Marillyn A. Hewson of Lockheed Martin and Michael Dell of Dell, among others. Before the meeting formally began, with cameras rolling, Mr. Trump wanted to talk about corporate tax rates  â\\x80\\x94   specifically lowering them. During one debate with Hillary Clinton, he had told voters: â\\x80\\x9cUnder my plan, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s going to be a job creator like we havenâ\\x80\\x99t seen since Ronald Reagan. Itâ\\x80\\x99s going to be a beautiful thing to watch. â\\x80\\x9d He repeated the 15 percent figure over and over again. However, when Mr. Trump spoke to the C. E. O.s that morning, he shifted the goal post slightly: â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re trying to get it down to anywhere from 15 to 20 percent. â\\x80\\x9d Inside the White House, until last Friday, according to people involved in the conversations, the target rate had been bumped up again, to a minimum of 20 percent and very likely a bit more. And now, given that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act is off the table  â\\x80\\x94   and with it the $1 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years that the administration needed to help make its tax plan deficit neutral  â\\x80\\x94   there is a good chance that any tax package would include a corporate rate that is even further from Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s initial pledge, perhaps as high as 28 percent. Donâ\\x80\\x99t take my word for it. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the figure that Grover Norquist, the   activist who is the president of Americans for Tax Reform, and who has long sought the lowest rate possible, has calculated would be needed for the plan to be deficit neutral after 10 years. That way it could come under the heading of budget reconciliation, which would allow the Senate to pass legislation with a simple majority. If the 28 percent corporate tax rate sounds familiar, thatâ\\x80\\x99s because it is: It was the same rate that President Barack Obama proposed in 2012 and again in 2013, when he also proposed to lower the tax rate for United States manufacturers to 25 percent. He made the proposal again in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Each time, his tax plan was summarily dismissed by Republicans who called the rate too high and uncompetitive. Now, Republicans may end up negotiating a tax package with a corporate tax rate that looks a lot like the one they rejected out of hand for the last five years. Why is the rate so important? Because almost all those on Wall Street  â\\x80\\x94   and in corner offices throughout corporate America  â\\x80\\x94   have been baking into their models a tax reform plan that they say will   additional investments, leading to higher growth in the economy. As an example, Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of ATT, told analysts this year, â\\x80\\x9cWe know at ATT that if you saw tax rates move to 20 percent to 25 percent, we know what we would do: We would step up our investment levels. â\\x80\\x9d Some of those investments become harder to justify if the rate is higher, executives say. The Standard  Poorâ\\x80\\x99s   index already has an effective tax rate of about 28 percent, according to WalletHub. The United States has the highest top statutory corporate tax rate among Group of 20 nations, according to a study by the Congressional Budget Office. As evidenced by the stock marketâ\\x80\\x99s pullback on Friday and again on Monday, investors and analysts are redoing their math to account for the fact that tax reform may not happen as soon as they expected  â\\x80\\x94   the Trump administration had said it would happen by August  â\\x80\\x94   and that rates will not come down as much as had been anticipated. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who oversaw the effort to repeal Obamacare, acknowledged that the billâ\\x80\\x99s failure would â\\x80\\x9cmake tax reform more difficult. â\\x80\\x9d He has yet to publish a new set of corporate tax rates, but his original plan called for a rate of 20 percent. That plan depended not only on Obamacareâ\\x80\\x99s repeal, to save $1 trillion, but also on another plan that seems increasingly unlikely to gain support: a   border adjustment tax  â\\x80\\x94   a euphemism for an import tax on all goods  â\\x80\\x94   that was expected to raise another $1 trillion over 10 years. The border adjustment tax, an obsession of Mr. Ryanâ\\x80\\x99s, has divided Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s advisers. Stephen K. Bannon has been a proponent, seeing it as an incentive for more companies to make goods here in the United States. Others, like Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross and Steven Mnuchin, have been more ambivalent, people involved in the discussions say, in part because other countries could retaliate, making it harder for United States manufacturers to export goods. Many American retailers, like Walmart, and even some manufacturers  â\\x80\\x94   including Ford and Fiat Chrysler, which make some car models in Mexico and Canada and import them into this country  â\\x80\\x94   have expressed their anxiety about how a border adjustment tax would affect their business. Given the squabbling within the Republican Party over the repeal of Obamacare, itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to imagine that a congressman with constituents including big retailers  â\\x80\\x94   retail jobs outnumber manufacturing jobs in the United States by about four to one  â\\x80\\x94   would vote in favor of a border adjustment tax. â\\x80\\x9cThe border adjustment tax, the most controversial piece of current   discussions, is less likely to pass,â\\x80\\x9d SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale wrote in a note to clients over the weekend. â\\x80\\x9cIf Congress fails to approve tax reform ahead of August, confidence is likely to slip. Congress could still pass a bill by the end of the calendar year, but even that could slip. â\\x80\\x9d Without the $2 trillion in revenue and tax savings that the border adjustment tax and Obamacare repeal would generate, it is virtually impossible to see how the Trump administration could find a path to a corporate tax rate anywhere near what it originally promised. (Of course, the administration could pull back on its pledge to lower taxes for the middle class, but that seems unlikely.) The   question is whether lowering corporate taxes would ultimately have the desired effect. â\\x80\\x9cWhile there is no doubt that tax policy can influence economic choices,â\\x80\\x9d a study by the Brookings Institution determined, â\\x80\\x9cit is by no means obvious, on an ex ante basis, that tax rate cuts will ultimately lead to a larger economy in the long run. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       " 'The blueprint for the Trump administrationâ\\x80\\x99s FY 2018 budget released on Thursday â\\x80\\x9callows for significant funding of humanitarian assistance, including food aid, disaster, and refugee program fundingâ\\x80\\x9d in the State Department. [â\\x80\\x9cThis would focus funding on the highest priority areas while asking the rest of the world to pay their fair share,â\\x80\\x9d the blueprint states.  â\\x80\\x9cTaken together with the executive order, it looks like the president will keep the refugee program with a lower annual number, like the 50, 000 limit specified in Executive Order 13780, and when the annual determination is released, identify countries of concern in a way that excludes Somalia, and other countries of concern that are known to harbor terrorists,â\\x80\\x9d a source familiar with the federal refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News. â\\x80\\x9cAs long as he keeps the refugee program going, we are going to get more people from countries related to real security issues and regardless, the program needs to be legislatively reformed and regulations that have caused Constitutional violations repealed before restarting in FY 2018,â\\x80\\x9d the source adds. The language of the blueprint, however, could be interpreted to suggest that the Trump administrationâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9csignificant funding of . . . [the] refugee programâ\\x80\\x9d defines the program broadly to include safe zones in other parts of the world in addition to the federal refugee resettlement program. As such, a further reduction of refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2018 could be entirely possible. President Trump supported the establishment of safe zones for refugees during the campaign. Typically, the president releases an annual determination of the number of refugees to be allowed into the country in the month preceding the start of a new fiscal year, which begins on October 1. Under the Refugee Act of 1980, that number is determined at the sole discretion of the president. Subsequent to the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s determination of that number, Congress has traditionally funded the refugee resettlement program at the level set by the president for the coming fiscal year. FY 2017 has proceeded differently. In September, President Obama announced a determination that he wanted Congress to fund the arrival of 110, 000 refugees in the United States in FY 2017, an increase from 84, 995 that arrived in FY 2016. Congress, caught up in an election year in which the number of refugees to be resettled, as well as their vetting and countries of origin, were key issues in the Presidential campaign, did not pass a budget for the full fiscal year prior to the beginning of FY 2017. Instead, Congress passed a temporary continuing resolution that extended the FY 2016 budget through the first ten weeks of FY 2017, then renewed an additional continuing resolution in December that runs out at the end of April. That budget funds refugee resettlement at the FY 2016 level of 84, 995 annually for a little more than a month more. Come April 28, there will be no budget authority for any discretionary budget activities â\\x80\\x94  including refugee resettlement â\\x80\\x94  unless Congress passes funding authority for the balance of FY 2017. Given the contentious current political environment of Washington, it is uncertain whether Congress will have such funding authority in place prior to that date. During the three months and 20 days of FY 2017, the final days of the Obama administration, 30, 122 refugees were resettled in the United States, which corresponds to an annualized rate of 83, 292. In the subsequent 55 days since the start of the Trump administration, 7, 989 refugees have been resettled in the United States, which corresponds to an annualized rate of 53, 018. To date, 38, 111 refugees have been resettled in the United States, which would leave room for a maximum of 11, 899 over the remaining six months and fourteen days of FY 2017, under President Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s 50, 000 level set in Executive Order 13769 signed on January 27, then set again in Executive Order 13780 signed on March 6. On Wednesday, 9th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Derrick Watson, an Obama appointee and 1991 Harvard Law School classmate of the former president, struck down Executive Order 13780 hours before it was scheduled for implementation. He based his   decision, issued just two hours after the hearing was concluded, on campaign statements made by President Trump prior to his election and a leaked â\\x80\\x9cdraft documentâ\\x80\\x9d from the office of a Department of Homeland Security Obama holdover whom Breitbart News had identified as one of eight top Department of Homeland Security Obama holdovers President Trump could â\\x80\\x9cfire or remove. â\\x80\\x9d In striking down Section 6, the portion of Executive Order 13780 in which President Trump limited the number of refugees to 50, 000 annually, Judge Watson â\\x80\\x94  for one of the first times in American history â\\x80\\x94  asserted the supremacy of the judicial branch over the legislative and executive branches. Not even Judge James Robart, who stopped the first executive order of the same title (Executive Order 13769) went that far in his usurpations. Robart notably excluded Section 5 d of Executive Order 13769, in which President Trump limited the number of refugees in FY 2017 to 50, 000, from his temporary restraining order. Also on Wednesday, 4th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Theodore Chuang, another Harvard Law School graduate Obama appointee and former bureaucrat in the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, issued a similar ruling. Though Chuang did not strike down President Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s statutory and Constitutional authority to limit the number of refugees on Wednesday, he did schedule a March 29 hearing  on plaintiffs motion to enjoin the â\\x80\\x9cspecific provision of the First Executive Order [Section 5 d of Executive Order 13679]â\\x80\\x9d in which the president set the annual refugee limit for FY 2017 at 50, 000. â\\x80\\x9cThe Court will resolve that Motion, which the parties have agreed should be construed to apply to the successor provision of the Second Executive Order [13780]  in accordance with the previously established schedule,â\\x80\\x9d Chuang wrote in his decision. HIAS, one of the nine major voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) paid more than $1 billion annually by the federal government to resettle refugees, is one of the plaintiffs in the Maryland case. HIAS hopes to persuade Judge Chuang to double the number of refugees to 100, 000 in FY 2017. Should he rule in favor of HIAS on March 28, Chuang will accelerate the pending Constitutional crisis that may be set off by Judge Watsonâ\\x80\\x99s decision, as respected attorney Paul Mirengoff wrote at Powerline Blog and Rush Limbaugh suggested in his nationally syndicated radio program. As to the number refugees who will be resettled in the United States during the balance of FY 2017, President Trump may take a page from President Andrew Jackson, whose tomb he honored during his visit to Nashville on Wednesday. â\\x80\\x9cJohn Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it,â\\x80\\x9d President Jackson said of an 1832 Supreme Court decision unfavorable to his policies issued by the Marshall Court. President Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s attitude to the unfavorable decision issued by Judge Watson regarding a presidentâ\\x80\\x99s Constitutional and statutory authority to limit the number of refugees arriving in the United States, a decision Judge Chuang may agree with on March 28,  may well be something like this: â\\x80\\x9cJudge Watson has made his decision now let him pay for it. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       " 'JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s ruling ANC decided to downgrade its embassy in Tel Aviv to a liaison office over a U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, ahead of a U.N. vote on Thursday on a resolution urging Washington to drop the move.  The decision was taken at the end of a five-day African National Congress conference, in which Cyril Ramaphosa was elected as its new leader and South Africa s likely next president after 2019 elections, following Jacob Zuma.  Delegates endorsed the proposal that we must give practical support to the oppressed people of Palestine and resolved on an immediate and unconditional downgrade of the SA (South Africa) Embassy in Israel to a Liaison Office,  new ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule said on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from Israel s Foreign Ministry. South Africa s ministry for international relations and cooperation said on its website that it was deeply concerned about Trump s move as it would undermine Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking, which has been frozen since 2014. The South African Board of Jewish Deputies and the South African Zionist Federation jointly condemned the ANC s decision. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly will hold a rare special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states to vote on the draft resolution, which Washington vetoed on Monday in the 15-member U.N. Security Council.     Most countries regard the status of Jerusalem as a matter to be settled in an eventual Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, although that process has been frozen for over three years. Israel deems Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.  The ANC s move comes at a time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been pursuing closer ties with other African countries. Last month, on a visit to Kenya, Netanyahu announced that Israel was opening a new embassy in nearby Rwanda  as part of the expanding Israeli presence in Africa and the deepening of cooperation between Israel and African countries . Israel is seeking to expel thousands of African migrants to Rwanda. On Thursday, Netanyahu described the United Nations as a  house of lies  on Thursday and said Israel  totally rejects this vote, even before approval . Trump upended decades of U.S. policy on Dec. 6 when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital, generating outrage from Palestinians and the Arab and Muslim world, and concern among Washington s Western allies. When under white-minority rule, South Africa was one of Israel s few allies on the continent. But after the 1994 demise of apartheid, relations cooled as the black-majority ANC took over. The ANC has condemned Israeli occupation of territories where Palestinians seek statehood, while maintaining full diplomatic and trade relations with Israel. ',\n",
       " \"In 2016, celebrities came together to create an emotional video that minimized crimes committed or incidents that led to the death of black men and women, both young and old, across America. One of those celebrities was U2 s lead singer, Bono.For many, Bono s part in the video was even more controversial because he attempted to link the death of 9 black church members in South Carolina, who died while conducting a bible study at the hands of a young racist man, Dylann Roof, (who has since been sentenced to death for his heinous crime) with white cops who have killed blacks and have been found not guilty of intentional murder.The video doesn t just shine a light on injustices by white police officers, it promotes an atmosphere of hate and distrust for white people in America.It seems rather unusual that after U2 s Bono would cancel his concert in St. Louis that was scheduled for tonight, following a night of violent protests that led to the breaking of windows in the St. Louis Mayor s home (who supports BLM) and the shutting down of traffic for  safety  reasons. Isn t this the same group he stood by when he participated in the controversial video above? Why would Black Lives Matter protesters harm anyone who came to see an entertainer who stood by them in such a powerful and emotional video?Why not host the concert?

       " 'GARISSA, Kenya â\\x80\\x94 Tension and anxiety remained high Friday as the Kenyan military launched a campaign to flush out terrorists linked to the Garissa University College massacre.\\n\\nThe campaign came as Kenyan Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett imposed a curfew on the borderlands with Somalia from 6:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. local time.\\n\\nFew businesses remained open early on Friday evening before the curfew took hold. Some said the heavily armed Kenyan troops were overly zealous in rooting out Al Shabaab terrorists who have claimed responsibility for the attacks.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not safe here for us as residents,\" said Abdikadir Adolwa. \"The soldiers are whipping residents to force them to identify terrorists. The military have terrorized this area and we fear going to the streets of the town.\"\\n\\nMany residents who could stay outside the town opted to leave while the troops were present.\\n\\n\"They\\'re arresting people who have no national identity cards,\" said Nathar Abdkir Balza, a mother of five, who owns a hotel in Garissa. \"You can be arrested for loitering.\"\\n\\nEthnic Somalis especially have deserted the area. Al Shabaab hails from nearby Somalia.\\n\\n\"The Somalis like miraa but they are now afraid to come to town and buy it,\" said Kevin Kariuki, who sells miraa, or khat, an African plant that has slightly intoxicating effects when chewed.\\n\\nEarlier Friday, the Kenyan government appealed for help in capturing nine men, described as \"bloodthirsty, armed and dangerous,\" in the wake of an attack on Garissa University that left 148 people dead.\\n\\nAttackers from the Somali-based terror group al-Shabab told university students before they were killed that \"this is the beginning of more attacks\" targeting schools and universities in the country, the Kenya-based Standard reported.\\n\\nThe four gunmen were killed Thursday as security forces moved to end the 15-hour siege, which appeared to target Christians and Islamic converts. Two security guards, one policeman and one soldier were among the dead. At least 79 people were injured, and more than 500 students held hostage were rescued.\\n\\nInterior Minister Joseph Nkaissery updated the casualties figures Friday, saying the gunmen killed 148 people. He said 142 of the dead were students, three were policemen and three were soldiers. Nkaissery added that 104 people were wounded.\\n\\nSurvivor Claire Mumo, a student, was in the college when the terrorists attacked on Thursday.\\n\\n\"I was woken up by gunshot sounds inside our dormitory. The four gunmen I noticed ordered everybody to lie down before they started shooting at us,\" said Mumo. \"The blood of my friend spilled on my head when she was shot. The gunmen thought they had shot and killed me.\"\\n\\nThe gunmen left her alone because they thought she was already dead, she said. As she lay on the floor, she heard them carry out their plans.\\n\\n\"I heard them asking and separating Muslims and Christians students. Then shortly I heard sounds of gunshots,\" Mumo added. \"I only came out when I saw our security forces collecting bodies. I will never forget this attack. I\\'m lucky to be alive.\"\\n\\nSurvivor Helen Titus said one of the first things that the al-Shabab gunmen did when they entered the campus early Thursday was to head for a lecture hall where Christians were in prayer. Al-Shabab is a Somalia-based Islamic extremist group with ties to al-Qaida.\\n\\n\"They investigated our area. They knew everything,\" Titus told The Associated Press outside a hospital in Garissa where she was being treated for a bullet wound to the wrist.\\n\\nTitus, a 21-year-old English literature student, said she smeared blood from classmates on her face and hair and lay still at one point in hopes the gunmen would think she was dead.\\n\\nThe gunmen also told students hiding in dormitories to come out, assuring them that they would not be killed, said Titus, who wore a patient\\'s gown as she sat on a bench in the hospital yard.\\n\\n\"We just wondered whether to come out or not,\" she said. Many students did, whereupon the gunmen started shooting men, saying they would not kill \"ladies,\" Titus said. But they also shot women and targeted Christians, said Titus, who is a Christian.\\n\\nEsther Wanjiru said she was awake at the time of the attack. Asked if she lost anyone, she said: \"My best friend.\"\\n\\nAnother survivor, Nina Kozel, said she was awakened by screaming and that many students escaped by sprinting to the fences and jumping over them. Some suffered bruises, she said. Many men were unable to escape, and hid in vain under beds and in closets in their rooms, according to Kozel.\\n\\n\"They were shot there and then,\" she said.\\n\\nThe mortuaries in Garissa, near the Somali border in northeastern Kenya, were so overwhelmed they had to ship many of the bodies to the capital of Nairobi, 200 miles away, the BBC reported.\\n\\nThe government began evacuating students who survived the Thursday terror attack, but many parents still don\\'t know about their fate of their children.\\n\\n\"I phoned my daughter Susan since yesterday in the morning when I received bad news about the attack, but she didn\\'t pick my calls,\" said Eunice Wangari, a mother of three. \"I don\\'t know if she\\'s still alive or not. The government is taking too long to identify the bodies. I am very stressed.\"\\n\\nJudith Musyoka, 45, and Boaz Musyoka, 55, are still searching for their son, Sammy Mutiso Musau in the wake of the attack that killed 147 students and staff.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know if my son is still alive,\" said Boaz. \"When I heard the news about terror attack I called him several times but his phone was not going through. I need to know his fate.\"\\n\\nA curfew was imposed for two weeks on Garissa and three neighboring counties. Cabinet Secretary of Education Jacob Kaimenyi ordered the university closed for an unspecified period, sending many students lugging suitcases onto buses Friday.\\n\\nThe Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) advised teachers in the region to leave immediately if they felt unsafe.\\n\\n\"We will not allow our teachers to risk their lives working in an insecure environment,\" said Willison Sosion, chairman of KNUT, who called for Garissa University to be closed permanently.\\n\\nSome Kenyans were angry that the government didn\\'t take sufficient security precautions. The attack came six days after Britain advised \"against all but essential travel\" to parts of Kenya, including Garissa.\\n\\nA day before the attack, President Uhuru Kenyatta dismissed that warning as well as an Australian one pertaining to Nairobi and Mombasa, saying: \"Kenya is safe as any country in the world. The travel advisories being issued by our friends are not genuine.\"\\n\\nGarissa Gov. Nathif Jama Adam condemned the attack and demanded the government address security in the region to stop locals from leaving.\\n\\n\"I want to plead with Kenyans to stay here as we work with the government to boost security in our region,\" he said, in particular appealing to Christians in the region. \"We\\'ll not allow terrorists to divide our people on religion lines.\"\\n\\nKenyan officials offered a $220,000 bounty for Mohammed Mohamud, who they suspect planned the attack. On social media, the Interior Ministry called him \"the mastermind.\"\\n\\nMohamud, who goes by other aliases, may have been assisted by two youths who conducted surveillance on the university, Kenya\\'s The Star newspaper reported. He reportedly has claimed responsibility for a bus attack that left dozens dead late last year.\\n\\nNational chairperson of the National Muslim Council of Kenya, Nazlin Umar Fazaldin Rajput, criticized the government for failing to shore up security after Somali-based militants attacked civilians in retaliation for Kenyan military operations against their base in Somalia. Kenya began those operations in 2011 after a spate of kidnappings.\\n\\n\"All it took was four poorly armed terrorists against our entire intelligence and armed forces. This is a shame,\" she said. \"It is not the terrorist who is an enemy, the enemy is our failed security apparatus and the officers charged with those dockets.\"\\n\\nRajput said the Kenyan military can do a better job guarding the borders and the people.\\n\\n\"Until we replace inefficient officers with efficient ones and address the root cause of our suffering, we will not win the battle against terror,\" she said. \"We have the U.N. and foreign countries giving Kenya intelligence reports, but there is no efficient execution, save to harass innocent Muslims.\"\\n\\nOthers said Muslims, like all Kenyans, must cooperate with authorities, pointing to another terror attack near Dadaab camp for refugees â\\x80\\x94 10 miles from Garissa University â\\x80\\x94 on Thursday.\\n\\nDadaab Deputy County Commissioner Albert Kimanthi said an unknown number of gunmen wearing balaclavas and armed with AK-47 rifles stormed the camp around 3 a.m. and killed a teacher. The gunmen injured four guards.\\n\\n\"It\\'s our responsibility to give intelligence necessary information to curb such attacks,\" he said. \"The joint operation that involves the regular and administration police officers has been working hard to nab the criminals.\"\\n\\nAt Garissa University, Maureen Manyego, 21, hid in a wardrobe in a women\\'s dormitory during the attacks. She said the terrorists lectured their victims on why they were about to die.\\n\\n\"We are here to kill and die with you,\" the militants said, she told the Standard. \"We are not afraid of death.\"\\n\\nThey told the students they were being killed \"to pay for the arrogance of your political leader\" who refuses to remove troops from Somalia.\\n\\n\"As long as Kenya\\'s military is in Somalia, it will be paid with its citizens blood,\" the militants said, according to Manyego.',\n",
       " 'If Lewis Black really does have a ticket to the inauguration, Donald Trump is probably trying to revoke it right now.Because during Wednesday night s Daily Show, the comedian roasted Trump, taking particular aim at Trump s inauguration problems.For weeks, Trump and his team have been desperately trying to find an A-list celebrity to perform at the inauguration. For the most part, Trump has failed, so he has resorted to hiring a reality show contestant and a has-been band, while forcing the Radio City Rockettes to perform because they can be fired for saying no.Black informed Trump that if he wants to know why many celebrities died in 2016, it s because they didn t want to perform at the inauguration either. You want to know why so many celebrities died in 2016? It was to get out of playing the goddamn inauguration,  Black quipped.Then Black pointed out that Trump is pretending he doesn t really care if A-list celebrities show up, even going so far as to claim that he s the one who rejected them and not the other way around.The so-called  A  list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016Black was able to get a ticket, however, and he intends to show up on Friday whether Trump likes it or not. I ve got my tickets, and I m going to go no matter what,  Black said.  Because I want to be there when Trump touches the Bible and his hand catches on fire. Black went on to break the news to Trump that even Richard Nixon was able to land A-list talent for his inaugural ceremony by getting legendary entertainer James Brown to sing. All Trump has been able to get so far is Jackie Evancho, who didn t even win America s Got Talent.To make matters worse, Trump s team literally humiliated themselves by bragging about the participation of the Caisson Platoon and the famous army horse Black Jack. The problem is that Black Jack has been dead since 1976. Trump is  tweeting a dead horse,  Black quipped.Black then revealed Trump s inauguration them is  soft sensuality  which Black says is good because at least Trump is going to f*ck America  gently. Here s the video via YouTube.With an embarrassment like Trump in office, comedians like Lewis Black are definitely going to have plenty of material over the next four years.Featured Image: Screenshot',\n",
       " 'Hedge fund titans once ran their firms like elite private clubs, picking who made it past the velvet rope and how much they would pay for access to supercharged performance. Years of poor performance have now led a number of funds to consider something more like general admission. Some   investors  â\\x80\\x94   MetLife, American International Group and the New York City pension plan, among them  â\\x80\\x94   have recently begun to withdraw their money from hedge funds in larger numbers. And the investors who stay are getting a chance to sit at the negotiating table and dictate lower fees and better terms for sharing in the returns that managers make. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an unusual position for many hedge fund managers, who as a group are not known for sharing well with others. For decades, hedge funds operated on a â\\x80\\x9c2 and 20â\\x80\\x9d model: Investors paid fees of 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any gain in any year. When performance was good, the founders of the biggest firms were catapulted to the top of global wealth rankings. Now, in a bid to persuade investors to stay, some managers are sweetening the deal by lowering fees in return for locking up investor money for a longer period of time and setting certain performance targets that if exceeded, investors would pay a fee. For newcomers, managers are even offering the favorable terms once exclusively offered to longtime loyal clients. â\\x80\\x9cManagers are having to negotiate, and investors are demanding much more than they used to in the absence of value,â\\x80\\x9d said Adam I. Taback, head of global alternative investments at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. â\\x80\\x9cHigh fees are like an expensive car,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIt is fine as long as youâ\\x80\\x99re getting performance out of it. â\\x80\\x9d In recent years, investor criticism of hedge fund underperformance against a roaring stock market was met with frustration by managers who complained that investors couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have their cake and eat it, too. A hedge fund managerâ\\x80\\x99s job was to protect in down years but not outperform in good years, the industry argued. But when markets began to fall last summer, so did hedge fund returns, rendering the point moot for many investors. Over the last 18 months some of the   managers  â\\x80\\x94   including William A. Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management and Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management  â\\x80\\x94   have consistently lost money. Others that made bets on macroeconomic trends were caught off guard by   bets and had to shutter their firms. And many hedge fund managers found themselves crowded in the same stock. That meant big returns as everyone piled in but even bigger declines when everyone sold out. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, for example, was one of the most popular stocks held by hedge funds in 2015, and its stock price soared to more than $260 a share at one point. But when news of a government investigation came to light and issues with the companyâ\\x80\\x99s pricing strategy became apparent, the stock came crashing down. On Friday, Valeantâ\\x80\\x99s share closed at a low of $24. Mr. Ackman, who has been Valeantâ\\x80\\x99s biggest cheerleader, has lost billions of dollars so far on his bet on the company. His Pershing Square Holdings is down 17. 5 percent so far this year through June 7, in large part because of the Valeant position. Other hedge fund titans including Paulson  Company and Viking Global Investors have collectively lost billions of dollars on the Valeant trade. â\\x80\\x9cI see the herd mentality among hedge funds every day,â\\x80\\x9d Roslyn Zhang, a managing director at China Investment Corporation, Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s sovereign wealth fund, said at the SkyBridge Alternatives, or SALT, hedge fund conference in Las Vegas last month. Describing how some funds spend â\\x80\\x9ctwo secondsâ\\x80\\x9d on one theme before deciding to put investor money behind the idea, she added: â\\x80\\x9cWe pay 2 and 20 for treatment like this. I am reflecting that maybe we are not making the right decision. â\\x80\\x9d All of this has prompted some   within the industry. â\\x80\\x9cWe are in the first innings of a washout in hedge funds,â\\x80\\x9d Daniel S. Loeb, the founder of the hedge fund Third Point, wrote to investors in a recent letter, describing a â\\x80\\x9ccatastrophic periodâ\\x80\\x9d for the industry. But for some investors, acknowledgment of poor performance is not enough. In September 2014, the nationâ\\x80\\x99s biggest pension fund, the California Public Employeesâ\\x80\\x99 Retirement System, or Calpers, announced plans to liquidate its $4 billion hedge fund holdings on concerns that the investments were too expensive and too complicated. In April this year, the pension fund for New York City civil employees voted to exit its portfolio of $1. 5 billion in hedge fund investments. Some insurance companies have shown their displeasure, too. â\\x80\\x9cWe had a very negative experience in hedge funds,â\\x80\\x9d Peter D. Hancock, the chief executive of A. I. G. told investors earlier this year. The insurance group plans to pull about half of its $11 billion in hedge fund holdings. MetLife, another insurance giant that has roughly $1. 8 billion invested in hedge funds, has been sending out redemption requests to those managers. Steven Goulart, its chief investment officer, recently told shareholders that the exit was prompted by inconsistent performance. The market environment will â\\x80\\x9ccontinue to be challenging for hedge funds,â\\x80\\x9d he added. Investors pulled $15. 1 billion from the industry in the first quarter of the year. But these exits are a drop in the ocean compared with the $2. 9 trillion the industry manages. Other institutional investors, meanwhile, continue to pump money in. Still, the pressure is mounting. â\\x80\\x9cNow the fact that people are willing to cut, youâ\\x80\\x99re going to see pressure on managers who are not at the top of the pyramid are going to have to cut,â\\x80\\x9d said Mark W. Yusko, the chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital. In a move that is largely   in the industry, Mr. Robbins recently apologized to investors in an attempt to stem the outflow of investor money from his firm. He pledged to â\\x80\\x9cright the ship as quickly as possibleâ\\x80\\x9d and even offered investors the opportunity to put more money into a new fund that would waive fees. Mr. Robbins has continued to lose money this year. Investors in his flagship fund have lost 6. 5 percent as of the end of May. So Mr. Robbins is now offering more favorable redemption terms, allowing existing investors that add more money into the fund to step into the shoes of investors that have left, according to three people briefed on the firmâ\\x80\\x99s plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them. As long as performance continues to lag, hedge funds will be scrutinized and hedge fund giants will be at a disadvantage. David Rubenstein the billionaire   of the private equity firm Carlyle Group, perhaps summed up the sentiment best when he told an audience of money managers at the SALT conference in May, â\\x80\\x9cPlease donâ\\x80\\x99t be embarrassed about the industry. â\\x80\\x9d In case there was any hesitation, Mr. Rubenstein added: â\\x80\\x9cWe shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be upset about what we do. We should be proud. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'Fox News banshee Jeanine Pirro threw a hissy fit this weekend because First Lady Michelle Obama correctly stated how most people feel since Donald Trump became president-elect.On Friday, Mrs. Obama sat down for her final interview as First Lady with Oprah Winfrey and expressed what millions of Americans are feeling right now as President Obama enter the last month of his presidency. We feel the difference now,  she said.  See, now, we are feeling what not having hope feels like. Hope is necessary. It s a necessary concept and Barack didn t just talk about hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes. Indeed, the only ones who didn t feel hope in 2008 were conservatives who vowed from day one to sabotage President Obama at every turn, hurling racism and hate every step of the way for the last eight years. But even more Americans are going to sorely miss him and the optimism he brought to the office. Donald Trump, however, is no Barack Obama. As Trump continues to hire people who hate the department they have been picked to head and picks fights with foreign nations and is poised to dismantle every program that made this country great already, millions of Americans are horrified and living in fear of what this nation is about to become.Of course, Pirro had a problem with Michelle Obama telling the truth, so she lashed out at her for five minutes by blaming her for everything from beheadings in the Middle East to protests against police.Basically, Pirro bitched about Michelle Obama in every little way and acted like a petulant child. To try and convince America that once you and Barack exit the White House, hope is removed for America is an outrage,  Pirro whined.  But I get it, for you hope is gone. You and your family and friends won t be able to fly to another 46 countries, with security and hair and make-up in tow. Michelle, you may not realize it, but Americans  rejected you and everything you stand for. Hope is when people   30,000 at a time   stand in line in the cold with their children hoping to get a glimpse of a man they think can change the course of their lives from the downward spiral that you and  Mister Hope and Change  have put them on. Here s the video via YouTube.Of course, Americans did not  reject  the Obamas in this election at all. In fact, Obama s approval rating is higher than Trump s and millions would have preferred voting for him a third time. Also, Russia helped Trump steal the election and Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly three million votes. Most Americans also fear a Trump presidency. Someone should explain to Pirro that fear is the opposite of hope.As someone who claims to support women s rights, one would think Pirro would also be concerned about Trump being in the White House considering the way he has treated women over the years. Pirro is also pro-choice, which goes against Republicans who currently aim to eliminate Roe v. Wade in the next four years. So women across the country have every reason and right to be losing hope since their freedom could be seriously restricted. But apparently, Pirro forgot about women and the plight they are about to face.Once again, Pirro is demonstrating that she s a racist bitch who hates successful women for speaking their minds and telling the truth.Featured Image: Screenshot',\n",
       " 'KINSHASA (Reuters) - At least four civilians and a police officer were killed in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Monday in clashes between security forces and protesters demanding the departure of President Joseph Kabila this year, Human Rights Watch said. The national electoral commission announced this month that an election to replace Kabila, whose mandate expired last December, cannot take place until April 2019. The delay has raised fears of an escalation of violence in Congo, which is Africa s biggest copper producer. Activist groups in the eastern city of Goma had called for a general strike on Monday to protest against the election delay. Unrest broke out by 5 a.m. (0300 GMT) between police and protesters, who barricaded roads and burned tires, local residents and the police said. Security forces killed at least four civilians and one police officer also died in the clashes, said Ida Sawyer, central Africa director at New York-based Human Rights Watch.  A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission in Congo said it had documented 37 arrests but could not yet confirm a death toll. Provincial police commissioner Placide Nyembo said that the police officer was beaten to death by protesters and one demonstrator was killed by a stray bullet.  The police also said in a statement that they broke up a planned demonstration in the northern province of Tshopo by protesters with jerrycans filled with petrol.  Deteriorating security across Congo this year, including a spike in militia violence, has prompted fears the country could slip back to the multi-sided civil wars of the turn of the century, when hundreds of thousands were killed in violence and millions are believed to have perished of hunger and disease.  Kabila says the election delays are due to challenges registering millions of voters. His opponents say he plans to change the constitution to remain in power, as other African leaders have done.

       " 'KAMPALA (Reuters) - Grenades were thrown overnight at the homes of two Ugandan legislators opposed to scrapping the presidential age limit and thereby extending President Yoweri Museveni s more than 31 years in power. One of the legislators, Robert Kyagulanyi, was later arrested by police, his aide said. Kyagulanyi and fellow legislator Allan have been outspoken in efforts to resist an ongoing effort to change the constitution to allow Museveni to seek another term in elections set for 2021.  Museveni has been president since January 1986. Two grenades were thrown at Ssewanyana s residence and three others at Kyagulanyi s. Both legislators were among MPs forcefully ejected from the parliament chamber last week by Uganda s special forces.  The grenades were thrown,  police spokesman Asan Kasingye told Reuters early Tuesday. He said police were investigating, but dismissed as  absurd  the idea that the attacks were politically motivated. Talking to local NBS TV, Ssewanyana said he was scared but would not give up the fight against the constitutional change.  I can t give up and am calling upon all Ugandans not to give up because this is a serious fight. What shows the seriousness is the attacks that they have now started against us ... Attacks involving weapons,  he said.  Police later arrested Kyagulanyi as he left his home on the outskirts of the capital Kampala, his personal assistant, Hakim Katongole, told Reuters.  Kyagulanyi, a top Ugandan musician with a stage name Bobi Wine, joined politics after winning a parliamentary seat in a repeat election in June.  Another police spokesman told Reuters the legislator was arrested for a range of alleged offences including malicious damage, assault of officers on duty, causing bodily harm and others committed during the House brawl. During the fighting, microphone stands were plucked and used as crude weapons, chairs were thrown and bench seats were damaged. The fighting in the chamber pitted legislators opposed to extending Museveni s rule against special forces and legislators favoring the extension.

       " 'Laughter saved Linda Ragooâ\\x80\\x99s face. That is what a doctor told her after she had a stroke in 2003. It happened on a Sunday, at the end of an exhausting weekend of chores, errands and obligations. Ms. Ragoo felt part of her body go numb. â\\x80\\x9cI sat down by the bed and I felt my leg, like it was sleeping,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Ragoo recalled. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s sleeping too long. â\\x80\\x9d She was able to call one of her sisters, who rushed to Ms. Ragooâ\\x80\\x99s Brooklyn apartment and found her on the floor, unable to move, the left side of her body paralyzed. While they waited for an ambulance, Ms. Ragoo asked to use the bathroom. Her sister fetched a long stick, presumably to prod her across the floor. Ms. Ragoo cracked up at the absurdity of the moment. â\\x80\\x9cMy sister said, â\\x80\\x98Stop this nonsense, stop this nonsense,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I keep laughing. â\\x80\\x9d She spent the next month in a hospital. Ms. Ragooâ\\x80\\x99s mobility is still restricted by partial paralysis. But her facial muscles, built up by years of laughter, are as they have always been. Ms. Ragoo, 78, credits her jocular spirit and easygoing sense of humor in part to her upbringing in Trinidad, with its tropical weather,   way of life, and holiday and carnival celebrations. In the 1970s, Ms. Ragoo went to New York in search of an even better life. She settled in Brooklyn and found work as a nurseâ\\x80\\x99s aide. Though hardships and tragedy have marked her life, â\\x80\\x9cI can make a joke out of nothing,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Just recently, she dozed off in her recliner and somehow managed to slide off it, flopping to the floor. For her, it was a rude, yet hilarious, awakening. â\\x80\\x9cI laugh at my own self when I do stupid things,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cI laugh at myself many times. â\\x80\\x9d Levity not only carried Ms. Ragoo through the setbacks after her stroke, but it also helped her cope with a more painful loss. Her son Satinus, 58, had a heart attack and died in 2014. He was a nurseâ\\x80\\x99s aide, like his mother. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m telling you, things canâ\\x80\\x99t put you down,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Ragoo said of staying positive through trying times. She lives alone in a   apartment in Crown Heights, which is how she likes it. There is plenty of space just for her. And she does not need much of it to flourish. When it was time to get a new mattress, she willingly downgraded from a queen to a full. As much as she relishes independence, health problems drove her to seek outside help. Ms. Ragoo has arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure and osteoporosis, as well as mobility issues caused by the stroke. Ms. Ragoo sought help from Heights and Hills, which offers support services for older adults, and has a home attendant. Each month, Ms. Ragoo receives $811 from Social Security and $612 from a pension. Because of her tight income, Ms. Ragoo could not afford an   last summer. Usually a fan had been sufficient to keep her cool, but not last year. â\\x80\\x9cWhen that heat took me, I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t stand it,â\\x80\\x9d she said. She mentioned her concerns to her social worker and made clear the severity of the problem. â\\x80\\x9cI told her, â\\x80\\x98This is not funny. â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Ragoo said. Her caseworker reached out to FPWA, formerly the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and applied for a $600 grant in Neediest funds, which allowed Ms. Ragoo to buy an  . Ms. Ragoo fondly recalls more youthful pleasures, like traveling, especially cruises, and taking trips to the casino. Ms. Ragoo has not done either in some time. But it is hard to keep her from a dance floor pulsating with salsa or calypso. Her coordination and energy are not what they once were, but she still has rhythm. â\\x80\\x9cI dance with my cane,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cI hold my cane and I move from side to side. Because they say if you donâ\\x80\\x99t use it, you lose it. â\\x80\\x9d But she is quick to joke with people about her age. On a recent December afternoon, Ms. Ragoo declared she was just 16, despite the cane clutched to her side and dark glasses shielding her eyes after cataract surgery. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the best therapy, to laugh,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cYou have to keep on laughing. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " \"(Reuters) - Puerto Ricoâ\\x80\\x99s federally appointed financial oversight board said on Friday it will institute a two-day per month work furlough for government employees, but a defiant Governor Ricardo Rossello rejected the measure out of hand. The plan, which originally envisioned a four-day per month furlough, is set to begin on Sept. 1 and last throughout the 2018 fiscal year in an effort to achieve $218 million in savings. It excludes frontline law enforcement personnel. Rossello openly challenged the boardâ\\x80\\x99s authority to impose the belt-tightening measure on the bankrupt U.S. territory, however. The furloughs are part of the boardâ\\x80\\x99s efforts to implement fiscal changes and achieve $880 million in savings for â\\x80\\x9cright-sizingâ\\x80\\x9d the government this fiscal year and ensuring the islandâ\\x80\\x99s long-term economic viability. Natalie Jaresko, executive director of the oversight board, said the government had offered a number of ideas for achieving savings. Speaking during a webcast of the boardâ\\x80\\x99s ninth public meeting, she said the government had fallen short of meeting required money-saving goals, however. Furloughs could be scaled back or eliminated early if sufficient savings are achieved per the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s fiscal plan, the board said. Rossello, in a televised address late on Friday, said the furloughs were unjustified and unnecessary. He also highlighted, in a statement released by his office, public sector cutbacks and budgetary savings that resulted in higher than expected financial reserves. â\\x80\\x9cI do not accept nor will I execute the furlough submitted today by the Financial Oversight and Management Board,â\\x80\\x9d Rossello said. The board was created by the federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA. Rossello said section 205 of the PROMESA law means the board can make â\\x80\\x9crecommendationsâ\\x80\\x9d but not impose changes. Furloughs would represent a $340 million hit to the economy  in the current fiscal year, he said. Puerto Ricoâ\\x80\\x99s Treasury Secretary, Raul Maldonado, told Reuters on Wednesday that preliminary tax collections in July, the first month of fiscal 2018, were running $20 million to $30 million ahead of forecast. But board member Andrew Biggs spoke of the commonwealthâ\\x80\\x99s current state of affairs in stark terms during the meeting. â\\x80\\x9cThe simple fact is that the government of Puerto Rico has run out of money,â\\x80\\x9d he said. He added that â\\x80\\x9cthe difficult steps of raising taxes and cutting spendingâ\\x80\\x9d were something that the board and government alike â\\x80\\x9chave no choice but to do.â\\x80\\x9d Puerto Rico is seeking to restructure roughly $72 billion in debt and another near $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities while it struggles with the flight of residents to the U.S. mainland and a 45 percent poverty rate. Reforms of the pension system were among the measures discussed at Fridayâ\\x80\\x99s board meeting. They would include a 10 percent cut in benefits.

Conservative TreehouseAdditionally, according to WSCOTV:(6:00pm Sept 26th) [ ] The gun that Keith Scott had on him during the deadly shooting was reported stolen after a breaking and entering, police said.The breaking and entering suspect told ATF Agents that he sold the gun to Scott. The suspect is in custody.Three Days Ago: The Charlotte North Carolina police department have released Dash Camera and Body Camera footage of the Keith Scott shooting. This is the fifth video (3 eye witnesses and two police releases):The Charlotte Police also released pictures of the hand gun recovered from Keith Scott, and the ankle holster he was wearing (holster can be seen in video), along with the following statement:There have been numerous unconfirmed reports published in the media concerning this case. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has prepared the following case update to provide factual information about the officer-involved shooting.Two plain clothes officers were sitting inside of their unmarked police vehicle preparing to serve an arrest warrant in the parking lot of The Village at College Downs, when a white SUV pulled in and parked beside of them.The officers observed the driver, later identified as Mr. Keith Lamont Scott, rolling what they believed to be a marijuana  blunt.  Officers did not consider Mr. Scott s drug activity to be a priority at the time and they resumed the warrant operation. A short time later, Officer Vinson observed Mr. Scott hold a gun up.Because of that, the officers had probable cause to arrest him for the drug violation and to further investigate Mr. Scott being in possession of the gun.Due to the combination of illegal drugs and the gun Mr. Scott had in his possession, officers decided to take enforcement action for public safety concerns. Officers departed the immediate area to outfit themselves with marked duty vests and equipment that would clearly identify them as police officers.Upon returning, the officers again witnessed Mr. Scott in possession of a gun. The officers immediately identified themselves as police officers and gave clear, loud and repeated verbal commands to drop the gun. Mr. Scott refused to follow the officers repeated verbal commands.A uniformed officer in a marked patrol vehicle arrived to assist the officers. The uniformed officer utilized his baton to attempt to breach the front passenger window in an effort to arrest Mr. Scott.Mr. Scott then exited the vehicle with the gun and backed away from the vehicle while continuing to ignore officers  repeated loud verbal commands to drop the gun. Officer Vinson perceived Mr. Scott s actions and movements as an imminent physical threat to himself and the other officers. Officer Vinson fired his issued service weapon, striking Mr. Scott. Officers immediately rendered first aid and requested Medic to respond to the scene.Homicide Unit Detectives interviewed multiple independent civilian witnesses at the scene and at police headquarters. Those witnesses confirmed that officers gave numerous loud verbal commands for Mr. Scott to drop the weapon and also confirmed that at no time did Mr. Scott comply with their commands.A lab analysis conducted of the gun crime scene investigators recovered at the scene revealed the presence of Mr. Scott s DNA and his fingerprints on the gun. It was also determined that the gun Mr. Scott possessed was loaded at the time of the encounter with the officers. The investigation also revealed that Mr. Scott was wearing an ankle holster at the time of the event.Attached are photos of the gun, ankle holster and marijuana  blunt  in Mr. Scott s possession at the time of the incident.

       " 'CARACAS (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro defended Venezuelaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9csecureâ\\x80\\x9d election system on Tuesday as opponents struggled to present a united front over allegations of fraud in a nationwide vote surprisingly won by the ruling socialists.  Despite widespread anger over economic hardship, the Socialist Party confounded opinion polls to take 17 of 23 governorships in Sundayâ\\x80\\x99s election.  Stunned by the defeat that undermines their aim to win the presidency in 2018, the opposition Democratic Unity coalition refused to acknowledge the results and called the election rigged, as did the United States. Though the coalition has complained of an unfair playing field - from abuse of state resources to last-minute moving of vote centers away from opposition strongholds - it has not given detailed evidence of ballot-tampering. Some opposition figures have acknowledged abstention by their supporters - disillusioned by the failure of street protests to dislodge Maduro earlier this year - was a big factor. Two losing opposition candidates, Henri Falcon in Lara state and Alejandro Feo La Cruz in Carabobo, have conceded defeat, breaking with the official coalition position. Both criticized â\\x80\\x9cirregularitiesâ\\x80\\x9d in the vote but also lamented many demoralized opposition supporters stayed at home. â\\x80\\x9cWe need courage to recognize truth in adversity,â\\x80\\x9d said Falcon. The strongest criticism of Sundayâ\\x80\\x99s vote came from Washington, which slammed Maduroâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cdictatorship.â\\x80\\x9d Several European nations also expressed concern, while 12 countries in the Americas from the so-called Lima Group condemned â\\x80\\x9cobstacles, intimidation, manipulation and irregularitiesâ\\x80\\x9d. Washington is considering further sanctions on Venezuela, after various measures against top officials and the economy earlier this year, while the European Union is mulling the same. Government leaders have smarted at fraud accusations. â\\x80\\x9cVenezuelaâ\\x80\\x99s election system is the most secure and audited in the world,â\\x80\\x9d Maduro said on Tuesday. â\\x80\\x9cPresident Donald Trump, I am not a dictator; I am a humble worker ... I have a moustache and look like Stalin, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m not him.â\\x80\\x9d The Venezuelan leader invited EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini to visit or receive him in Brussels to â\\x80\\x9copen their eyes,â\\x80\\x9d and told â\\x80\\x9cstupidâ\\x80\\x9d Canada to stop meddling. Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza later said on Twitter that Maduro had recalled Venezuelaâ\\x80\\x99s ambassador to Canada for talks. Heaping further humiliation on Venezuelaâ\\x80\\x99s opposition, the governors were due to be sworn in on Tuesday by a new legislative superbody elected controversially in July. The opposition boycotted that vote and has refused to recognize the entirely pro-government Constituent Assembly, which supersedes all institutions including the opposition-controlled congress. The oppositionâ\\x80\\x99s five governors-elect planned to boycott the swearing-in ceremony, defying Maduroâ\\x80\\x99s threat to bar them from office for failing to accept the assembly as a higher authority. â\\x80\\x9cWe will not kneel to anyone,â\\x80\\x9d said Juan Pablo Guanipa, who won the oil-rich western Zulia state.  Despite food shortages, runaway inflation and a tanking currency, Venezuelaâ\\x80\\x99s government retains significant bastions of support, especially in poorer, rural parts of the country. In his news conference, Maduro said the socialists also won Bolivar state, which would take its total to 18 governorships versus five for the opposition.  The government won a total of 54 percent of the votes overall, he added. The election board has not confirmed the Bolivar result or the overall vote figures. With the opposition coalitionâ\\x80\\x99s dozens of parties arguing over whether there was fraud, what went wrong, and where to go next, it will need to regroup and map strategy quickly heading into the 2018 presidential campaign. Its very future may even be in doubt, since many young activists who took to the streets for four straight months of protests and pitched battles with security forces earlier this year feel betrayed by their leaders. The unrest killed at least 125 people. Maduro has long accused opposition leaders of being behind violence, and on Tuesday called the new opposition governor of Zulia state a â\\x80\\x9cfascistâ\\x80\\x9d while accusing his counterpart in Tachira of links to Colombian â\\x80\\x9cparamilitaries.â\\x80\\x9d The election aftermath appears to have sunk a government-opposition mediation effort that began last month in the Dominican Republic. Even though Maduro wants to resuscitate the talks, the opposition coalition has ruled that out. â\\x80\\x9cWe are the majority, the dictatorship is more-and-more illegitimate, popular and global condemnation grows daily against this regime,â\\x80\\x9d it said in a communique late on Monday.

They reveal the story of the world economy. Central bankers have done their best to conjure forth inflation in the hopes that this will vanquish deflation but the risk is that our daily lives, and the sustainability of governments, will be affected by an ongoing battle between these two forces. There will be important consequences. Quantitative Easing is now catching people in a vice by pushing up their cost of living even as their income is still falling. This breaks the vital social contracts between citizens and their governments and sets in motion many seemingly unrelated outcomes: social unrest in emerging markets, the movement of manufacturing and jobs back to the US and the West, improvements to the value added of emerging market firms, higher food and energy prices. The rising price, but shrinking size, of a steak, a candy bar and an apartment not only cause pain at home, they also propel some nations to deploy their militaries to secure resources and protect their citizens from the ill effects of inflation and deflation alike. This is already resulting in military confrontations, incidents and near misses between American, Chinese and Russian planes, warships and submarines. The solution is growth and innovation. Luckily, anonymous individuals are balancing their hubris against the risk of failure and proceeding to build a more dynamic economy and the new social contracts that will exist tomorrow. The only question is whether governments are hostile or hospitable to these efforts. By being alert to the many signals around us anyone can better navigate through the turbulence to the treasures of the world economy instead of being continuously overwhelmed and surprised by it. \\nAll the Presidentsâ\\x80\\x99 Bankers: The Hidden Alliances that Drive American Power â\\x80\\x93 Who rules America? \\nAll the Presidentsâ\\x80\\x99 Bankers is a groundbreaking narrative of how an elite group of men transformed the American economy and government, dictated foreign and domestic policy, and shaped world history. \\nCulled from original presidential archival documents, All the Presidentsâ\\x80\\x99 Bankers delivers an explosive account of the hundred-year interdependence between the White House and Wall Street that transcends a simple analysis of money driving politicsâ\\x80\\x94or greed driving bankers. \\nPrins ushers us into the intimate world of exclusive clubs, vacation spots, and Ivy League universities that binds presidents and financiers.

       " 'Stephen Colbert got an exclusive interview on CBS  The Late Show when Donald Trump s  publicist  called in. The publicist has been in the news lately since it was revealed that Trump pretended to be his own representative while dealing with the media in the 1980s and 1990s.The Washington Post reported that Trump often called up reporters who were covering him and pretended to be  John Miller  and  John Barron.  Trump then would use the fake identity to push stories about how he was purportedly dating models and celebrities like Madonna.Trump denied that he behaved this way in an interview with the Today show, but had previously admitted to it in court.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee also seemed to panic when reporters asked about it in a scheduled interview on Friday.Then, Friday afternoon, Washington Post reporters who were 44 minutes into a phone interview with Trump about his finances asked him a question about Miller:  Did you ever employ someone named John Miller as a spokesperson? The phone went silent, then dead. When the reporters called back and reached Trump s secretary, she said,  I heard you got disconnected. He can t take the call now. I don t know what happened. Trump s behavior is so odd and out of the ordinary that mainstream media reporters are often completely confused as to how to cover him. How do you address a narcisstic millionaire pushing xenophobia and racism who is woefully unprepared for the presidency? Perhaps more mocking from comedians like Colbert is the only rational way to deal with it.Certainly the late night comedy writers are getting almost as much raw material   maybe more   as they did when George W. Bush was president. What s bad for the country and national political conversation is most definitely great news for the world of comedy, and they re not stopping any time soon.Featured image via YouTube',\n",

       " 'MIAMI (Reuters) - Latinos angered by Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s tough stance on immigration could have been the Republican candidateâ\\x80\\x99s biggest obstacle on the road to the White House.  As it turned out, the brash New York businessman won enough Hispanic votes in Tuesdayâ\\x80\\x99s election to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton, with some Hispanics who supported him citing everything from ambivalence on immigration to conservative values and job growth. Reuters/Ipsos Election Day polling showed 28 percent of Americaâ\\x80\\x99s Hispanic voters cast ballots for Trump, compared to 66 percent for Clinton, putting him on a par with Republican Mitt Romneyâ\\x80\\x99s performance with the group in 2012. That outcome helped Trump upset Clinton in the critical battleground state of Florida, where he won 31 percent of Latino voters, while fending off challenges in border states such as Texas and Arizona.  Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s win on Tuesday came as a blow to pro-immigrant advocates who had been hoping that his calls for mass deportations of undocumented foreigners, as well as a massive border wall with Mexico, would drive Latinos to the polls against him in a showcase of rising Hispanic political power. â\\x80\\x9cIn our point of view, Latinos did their part to stop Trump,â\\x80\\x9d said Frank Sharry, executive director of immigrantsâ\\x80\\x99 rights group Americaâ\\x80\\x99s Voice. But he added: â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s going to be a lot of finger pointing.â\\x80\\x9d On the streets of Miami overnight Tuesday, celebrations by Latino Trump supporters offered a glimpse of his appeal. â\\x80\\x9cHe supports my values,â\\x80\\x9d said Humberto Quintero, 55, a Venezuelan-American who was among a large crowd celebrating outside Versailles Restaurant in a Cuban neighborhood in Miami, as cars passed honking their horns. He said Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s promise to restore American manufacturing jobs was also an important issue for him. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I was young, everything was made in America,â\\x80\\x9d Quintero said. â\\x80\\x9cNow everything is made in China.â\\x80\\x9d He said he also backed Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s plan for a wall. â\\x80\\x9cIn your house you donâ\\x80\\x99t let everybody come inside without your permission,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Hispanics made up 17.6 of the U.S. population in 2015, up 12 percent from 2012, according to the U.S. Census, making them the countryâ\\x80\\x99s largest ethnic minority. By 2060, more than one-in-four people in America will be Latino.  President Barack Obama won 70 percent of the Latino vote during his 2012 re-election bid while his challenger Romney took 28 percent, the same as Trump this time around. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s relationship with Hispanic voters started on an awkward footing when he began his campaign in June 2015, calling for tighter borders and accusing Mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States. He insisted he would force Mexico to pay for a multi-billion-dollar wall along the border to keep unwanted foreigners out of the United States, and vowed to round up and deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country. Those positions, which became a cornerstone of his campaign,  resonated badly on Tuesday with many voters along the U.S. side of the Mexican border. â\\x80\\x9cWhen he said the Mexicans were rapists and all this, drug dealers and stuff, it did kind of hit a chord,â\\x80\\x9d said Jazmin Gonzalez, 31, a Mexican-American from the Barrio Logan neighborhood in San Diego who voted for Clinton. â\\x80\\x9cWe know our people.â\\x80\\x9d Miguel Perez, 49, a maintenance engineer in Southern California who came to the United States from Mexico when he was 10, said he also voted for Clinton on Tuesday - mainly just to stop Trump. â\\x80\\x9cI would have voted for Donald Duck if I had to,â\\x80\\x9d he said after casting his ballot at San Ysidro High School near the border with Mexico. Clinton had sought to contrast her campaign with Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s by advocating for a path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants living in the country. She also hired immigrant activists for her campaign and featured undocumented immigrants at rallies. But she and the Democratic Party had at times raised the ire of Latino activists by focusing too heavily on bashing Trump while putting forward less-than-substantive efforts to appeal directly to Latinos, and rejecting pressure to name an Hispanic running mate. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s socially progressive platform, including her support of abortion rights, also may have rankled some religious conservatives within the Hispanic community. Lilian Enriquez, 45, a pastor who voted in Tucson, Arizona, on Tuesday, declined to say who she supported. But she said her vote was based largely on her sense of morality. â\\x80\\x9cThe United States is a country that has been cheapened morally, and I do not want to see ... people living a way that goes against the way of God,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Activist groups wanted to boost turnout among Latinos this year but figures are not yet in. In 2008, less than half of Latinos who were eligible to cast ballots actually did â\\x80\\x93 and the rate dipped in 2012, according to the census. In contrast, the voting rates for white and black voters were both well over 60 percent. ',\n",

       " 'Hurricane Matthew churned north along the coast of Florida on Friday, staying far enough offshore to spare the state a direct hit, but still caused flooding, wind damage and power failures. By Friday evening, it was a Category 2 storm, with sustained winds of up to 110 miles per hour, and government officials and forecasters shifted their focus to the threat of more serious damage on Saturday as the storm approaches Savannah and Charleston. The storm was blamed for the deaths of more than 800 people in Haiti, according to a Reuters report based on information from civil protection and local officials. For much of the day, officials warned that Jacksonville could suffer the worst damage. But while there was flooding in the area, the eye of the storm remained about 40 miles offshore as it passed Jacksonville. Dispatches from our reporters on the ground a live storm tracker map and answers to reader questions will be updated below. â\\x96\\xa0 At 10 p. m. the hurricaneâ\\x80\\x99s center was 50 miles   of St. Simons Island, Ga. and 90 miles   of Savannah, Ga. The storm was moving at about 12 m. p. h. with maximum sustained winds of 110 m. p. h. â\\x96\\xa0 It was predicted to continue to parallel the coast into Georgia and the Carolinas, putting Savannah Charleston, S. C. and Wilmington, N. C. at risk, before turning out to sea. â\\x96\\xa0 Florida officials blamed the storm for at least five deaths: three in St. Lucie County, one in Volusia County and one in Putnam County. Early on Friday, the St. Lucie County fire service received a call to aid a woman who had suffered a heart attack, but winds approaching hurricane force prevented emergency vehicles from responding. An older couple running a generator inside a garage died from carbon monoxide poisoning, the county said in a social media post. Around noon, another woman was killed in Volusia, Fla. when a tree fell on her after she went outside to feed animals, according to James T. Dinneen, the Volusia County manager. In Putnam County, between Gainesville and Daytona Beach, the sheriffâ\\x80\\x99s office said a woman had been killed when a tree fell onto a camper. Another man was injured. â\\x96\\xa0 Florida officials said Friday afternoon that more than 1 million customers were without electricity. â\\x96\\xa0 Significant flooding hit cities south of Jacksonville, including St. Augustine and Ormond Beach, on Friday. â\\x96\\xa0 The National Weather Service extended its hurricane warning northward into North Carolina. The Weather Service downgraded the hurricane warning for Floridaâ\\x80\\x99s   coast to a tropical storm warning, and lifted the tropical storm warning for the stateâ\\x80\\x99s southern coast. â\\x96\\xa0 President Obama warned against complacency. â\\x80\\x9cI just want to emphasize to everybody that this is still a really dangerous hurricane, that the potential for storm surge, flooding, loss of life and severe property damage continues to exist,â\\x80\\x9d he told reporters at the White House. â\\x80\\x9cPay attention to what your local officials are telling you. If they tell you to evacuate, you need to get out of there and move to higher ground. â\\x80\\x9d The president has declared a state of emergency in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, allowing federal agencies to coordinate relief efforts. â\\x96\\xa0 To cover the storm and its aftermath, The New York Times has journalists deployed along the path of Hurricane Matthew. Follow our correspondents on Twitter. Miami may have been spared the wrath of Hurricane Matthew, but for residents of the cityâ\\x80\\x99s Little Haiti neighborhood the anxiety over the storm was acute. Haiti, birth nation to most of the people in the Miami enclave, was devastated by the storm, which killed hundreds of people on the island and left fears of an even greater toll. â\\x80\\x9cI have two cousins I have not heard from  â\\x80\\x94   Iâ\\x80\\x99m very worried,â\\x80\\x9d Daniel Fils AimÃ©, who has lived in Little Haiti for a quarter of a century and was last in his native Les Cayes two years ago, said. â\\x80\\x9cSomebody is supposed to let me know. Someone is investigating. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. AimÃ©, 72, managed to get in touch with several friends in the devastated southwestern region of Haiti. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve heard from some friends  â\\x80\\x94   not others,â\\x80\\x9d he said as he bought pastries and bread at the Piman Bouk Bakery. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re all scattered now. People lost their houses. They had chickens and cows in the yard  â\\x80\\x94   everything went straight into the ocean. â\\x80\\x9d As the chairman of the   Chamber of Commerce, which he founded in 2005, Mr. AimÃ© said he was trying raise money to buy enough food to fill a container, with the intention of sending it to Les Cayes. Sitting with a friend in a small park at the intersection of 62nd Street and North Miami Avenue, Maximin Raphael, 59, closed his eyes and pursed his lips as he thought about his    sister, Gyslaine Joseph, in Les Cayes, and what she went through during the hurricane. Mr. Raphael, who has lived in the United States for 34 years, had finally managed to reach her by telephone on Friday morning, after days of trying. â\\x80\\x9cHer house is gone,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Raphael said. â\\x80\\x9cThe roof flew away. Everybody that lives there has a big problem. â\\x80\\x9d At the Piman Bouk Bakery, murals, both inside and out, portray a verdant and abundant Haiti in the manner of much of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s art. But the crushing realities of life there, made even more so by frequent batterings it takes from natural calamities like storms and earthquakes, were all too plain to the customers  â\\x80\\x94   almost invariably Haitian immigrants  â\\x80\\x94   who lined up Friday afternoon to buy goods. â\\x80\\x9cWe are all Haitian, so we have to be concerned, regardless of whether they are family or not,â\\x80\\x9d said   Richardson, a registered nurse who was born in Cap Haitien, in the countryâ\\x80\\x99s north, and who moved to Miami in 1986 after completing high school in her native country.  â\\x80\\x94   NICK MADIGAN, in Miami Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, declined to extend the deadline after a call from Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s presidential campaign to accommodate people disrupted by the hurricane. Read more Â» Forecasters say there are hints that the storm could take a path back toward the coastline, at a reduced strength. Read more from John Schwartz Â» On Friday afternoon in Charleston, S. C. officials warned of potentially   high tides, urged people to evacuate if they had not done so and set a curfew, from midnight until 6 a. m. Saturday, for those who remained. But as the wind whistled and rain began to spit on this peninsular city, those who remained here seemed remarkably relaxed. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s parties all over,â\\x80\\x9d said Elle Norton, 58, as she boarded up the windows of her pale pink house in downtown Charleston, and brought her potted plants inside. â\\x80\\x9cI have to go to the store now to get some appetizers. â\\x80\\x9d To Ms. Norton and many others here, the emptiness of Charlestonâ\\x80\\x99s    streets, where antebellum architecture is dotted with hidden courtyards and lush window boxes, was a refreshing break, because the city is usually brimming with tourists. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s so pleasant just hearing the birds,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Norton said. A few streets over, Normandy Farm Bakery had filled the case it normally reserved for oysters  â\\x80\\x94   of which there were only three left  â\\x80\\x94   with hot dogs and beer, and strung up a random assortment of celebratory balloons outside to signal they were staying open. â\\x80\\x9cYou ride it out in your house, youâ\\x80\\x99re gonna go bananas,â\\x80\\x9d said the owner, Mike Ray, who seemed unmoved by the dire warnings from public officials. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think itâ\\x80\\x99s gonna flood right here. â\\x80\\x9d Nearby, Jerome Monroe, a local handy man, closed the shutters on a fine arts gallery. He was planning to ride out the storm inside the Footlight Playerâ\\x80\\x99s Theater, where he would use a ShopVac to try to minimize flooding, though he knew he was powerless to prevent it entirely. â\\x80\\x9cWhen the water comes,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Monroe said, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re not stopping it. â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   JESSICA BIDGOOD in Charleston, S. C. John Schwartz, a New York Times reporter who covers climate change and the environment, is answering reader questions about the storm. He rode out his first hurricane, Carla, in his hometown, Galveston, Tex. at age 4. He has covered the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, as well as other storms for The Times.  Ask your hurricane questions here. Why do weather agencies and the news media keep getting the forecasts so wrong and overstate the severity of hurricanes? Is this some kind of insurance liability issue, where they are afraid of getting sued if they donâ\\x80\\x99t paint a â\\x80\\x98doomsdayâ\\x80\\x99 picture?  â\\x80\\x94   Jim The conservative approach isnâ\\x80\\x99t about liability, Jim, itâ\\x80\\x99s about saving lives. The storm track that Matthew has followed has been well within the range of possibilities that the National Hurricane Center has been talking about all along. This is still a dangerous storm, and just because some stretches of the Florida coast have not been hit as catastrophically as was possible, that does not mean the rest of Florida or Georgia or South Carolina are in the clear. Marshall Shepherd, the director of Atmospheric Sciences Program, University of Georgia, has been fiercely defending the warnings on Twitter, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll let him do the talking here: Chris W. Landsea, science and operations officer for the National Hurricane Center, said that while the storm has weakened somewhat, it is now spread over a larger area, and â\\x80\\x9ca larger hurricane can cause more storm surge,â\\x80\\x9d and a larger wind field the wind damage, in other words, can be felt over a larger area. So a slightly weaker but larger storm is â\\x80\\x9ckind of a wash, as far as impacts,â\\x80\\x9d he said. I grew up in Houston and also rode out Carla as a child as well as Henrietta in Cabo as an adult. I certainly believe in climate change, but is the hurricane season really worse now? What about the 1900 Galveston hurricane?  â\\x80\\x94   Jackie Berry There have always been hurricanes, and many have been profoundly destructive. The Great Storm of 1900 killed at least 6, 000 people on Galveston Island, and remains the deadliest natural disaster in United States history. But climate change isnâ\\x80\\x99t about these isolated incidents. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the   trend, and the   trend is not good. People remember the 1900 storm  â\\x80\\x94   and the haunting song about it, Wasnâ\\x80\\x99t that a Mighty Storm? and Erik Larsonâ\\x80\\x99s book â\\x80\\x9cIsaacâ\\x80\\x99s Stormâ\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   because it stands out in the damage that it did. What climate change is doing is dumping more heat into the oceans and more moisture into the air  â\\x80\\x94   conditions that are likely, over time, to make the strong storms that do develop become more powerful, and possibly more frequent, as well. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, noted that while global average temperatures are rising, â\\x80\\x9c20 times more heat is going into the oceanâ\\x80\\x9d than into the atmosphere, and so thatâ\\x80\\x99s a lot of power in the sea for hurricanes to draw on. And, in fact, while the 1900 storm was terribly destructive, much of that tragedy could be blamed on the lack of warning in those   times. Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to attribute any single weather event to climate change, but itâ\\x80\\x99s clear that climate change sets up conditions that can lead to more 1900 storms, more Katrinas, more Sandys. When I wrote about the science of attribution last year, Andrew E. Dessler, a climate researcher at Texas A  M, told me determining whether an extreme weather event like a flood is caused by climate change is like trying to figure out which of Barry Bondsâ\\x80\\x99s home runs were caused by his steroid use. â\\x80\\x9cYou know statistically some of them were, but you donâ\\x80\\x99t know which ones,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cAlmost certainly, it would have rained a lot even without climate change  â\\x80\\x94   but itâ\\x80\\x99s possible climate change juiced it, added a little bit. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'While it may not come as much of a surprise that the leadership at the National Rifle Association (NRA) has a different opinion on gun control than the average American, what is surprising is that same leadership holds a different opinion than the American gun owner. According to a new poll, at least 67 percent of gun owners in the United States believe that the organization has changed its mission from one promoting gun safety to one dominated by professional lobbyists. They say the NRA has been  overtaken by lobbyists and the interests of gun manufacturers and lost its original purpose and mission. The NRA of today looks very different from what it looked like before. In fact, for most of its history, it supported, and even wrote, gun control legislation. Adam Winkler, author of Gunfight: the Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America, wrote,  Historically, the leadership of the NRA was more open-minded about gun control than someone familiar with the modern NRA might imagine. To understand the relationship the NRA has with gun control. It may help to look at who and why it was founded. After the Civil War, many people in the North believed that people in the South possessed superior skills in the area of using rifles. They blamed that for the length of the war. The national slogan for the NRA was,  Firearms Safety Education, Marksmanship Training, Shooting for Recreation.  Its main goal was to improve men s marksmanship, not ward off threats to the Second Amendment. The organization was founded in 1871.That effort didn t start until the 1970s. In 1934, the nation saw its first piece of gun control legislation signed into law. The National Firearms Act of 1934 was designed to  make it difficult for any not law abiding citizen to obtain a pistol or revolver.  It was authored, in part, by the NRA. They also helped write the Gun Control Act of 1938.When these bills were written and signed into law, Karl T. Frederick was president of the NRA. He said,  I have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons. I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses. For about a century, the NRA s motto remained the same. Then the 1960s happened. With the unrest of the assassinations and the rise of the Black Panthers, The Mulford Act was passed in California. It barred people from carrying loaded weapons around outside. While it was supported by the NRA, the backlash that it spurred also galvanized a new wave of gun support. About a decade after the act was signed into law, a group of gun rights supporters took over the NRA. They ousted the leadership and changed the motto to,  The Right Of The People To Keep And Bear Arms Shall Not Be Infringed. Since then, the NRA has opposed many measures that have had widespread support from the American public. In poll after poll, people say they want people who buy guns to pass background checks, they want to limit the capacity of rifles and they support common sense gun control legislation. Even Supreme Court Justice Anontin Scalia supported limiting some of this. In his Heller v. DC decision, Scalia wrote,  Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. New data show more support for gun control from gun owners. While the NRA leadership says one thing, the average gun owner thinks another. A few years ago, Wayne LaPierre, NRA chief, said,  The only thing that can stop a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun.  This is the response from gun owners to that new poll.For its part, the NRA is disputing the accuracy of the poll. Jennifer Baker, spokesperson for the NRA said,  The NRA s strength is derived from our five million members and the tens of millions of Second Amendment supporters who vote. The majority of Americans oppose gun control and they made their voices heard this past November. This was a poll paid for by a gun control group, so it s not surprising that the so called  results  further their agenda. Public Policy Polling conducted the poll between April 19 and 20. It included 661 people who own guns. The margin of error is four percentage points. Americans for Responsible Solutions commissioned the poll.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'If we didn t know better, we d almost believe our Federal Government was attempting to give special privileges to Spanish speaking citizens. Perhaps they re establishing a precedent for taxpayer funded benefits for millions of illegal immigrants who will soon be American citizens The Social Security Administration (SSA) approved disability benefits for hundreds of Puerto Ricans because they do not speak English, despite the fact that Puerto Rico is a predominantly Spanish-speaking territory.According to a new audit by the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the agency is misapplying rules that are intended to provide financial assistance to individuals who are illiterate or cannot speak English in the United States. Under the rules, Puerto Ricans are allowed to receive disability benefits for their inability to speak English as well. We found the Agency did not make exceptions regarding the English-language grid rules for claimants who reside in Puerto Rico, even though Spanish is the predominant language spoken in the local economy,  the OIG said.The audit said a person applying for disability in Puerto Rico who cannot speak English  may increase his/her likelihood of receiving disability benefits. The agency does not currently have a system in place to keep track of the number of beneficiaries who receive disability insurance for not being able to speak English.However, the OIG was able to identify 218 cases between 2011 and 2013 where Puerto Ricans were awarded disability due to  an inability to communicate in English.  Furthermore, 4 percent of disability hearings in Puerto Rico involved looking at the individual s ability to speak, read, write, and understand English.Though 95 percent of Puerto Ricans speak Spanish at home, according to the rules a Spanish-speaking nurse in Puerto Rico would be considered  unskilled,  the OIG said.The SSA told the OIG that the rules are applied one-size-fits-all. SSA managers at various disability decision levels stated Social Security is a national program, and the grids must be applied to the national economy, regardless of local conditions,  the audit said.The SSA takes into account an individual s education level when considering awarding disability benefits if they do not qualify for medical reasons. Part of the education requirement involves looking at a person s ability to speak English, to determine whether it limits his ability to find a job.Last year Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.) raised concerns that the Obama administration was broadly applying the education rule under the Social Security Act to allow individuals to receive disability payments solely because they cannot speak English.He noted that the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) rolls swelled 230 percent between 2000 and 2010, while the U.S. population only grew 9.7 percent.Former SSA judges have also testified that individuals have been approved for disability in the United States without having to prove they cannot speak English.The hundreds of Puerto Ricans noted in the OIG s report have received disability insurance despite a 1987 U.S. District Court ruling that appears to contradict the SSA s policy. Benefits were denied on the grounds that  it is the ability to communicate in Spanish, not English, that is vocationally important in Puerto Rico. It should be noted, however, that the court explicitly declined to apply this rationale outside of this one case,  the OIG said.The SSA agreed with the OIG s recommendations to figure out how many individuals have been  awarded disability based on their inability to communicate in English,  and to  evaluate the appropriateness  of applying the English-speaking rules to Puerto Rico.The SSA is currently gathering information for a proposed regulation that  could lead to changes  to the English-speaking rule, the agency said.Via: Free Beacon',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Missing from President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s budget proposal this week was an annual report, known as the Green Book, that presidents have issued for many years to spell out their tax goals in detail, an omission that tax experts called telling. The Green Book, named for the color of its cover in recent years, is not that big a deal as a document, but its absence this year shows that the Trump White House lacks a clear vision for what to do about overhauling the tax code, experts said. â\\x80\\x9cI think itâ\\x80\\x99s as simple as no tax plan equals no Green Book,â\\x80\\x9d said Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute, a liberal think tank. Democratic lawmakers on Thursday in two Senate hearings criticized the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s fiscal 2018 budget proposal, released on Tuesday, and some of its core tax components. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen called the budget proposal and its tax assumptions â\\x80\\x9cfantasy flim-flam.â\\x80\\x9d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, appearing at one of the hearings, said the budget proposal did not consider how new tax laws would impact government revenues and the deficit because the Trump administration did not have a detailed tax proposal. â\\x80\\x9cWhen the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s budget was done, we were not ready to have a full-blown tax reform plan,â\\x80\\x9d Mnuchin said, adding that tax details would be worked out with Congress, then made public. A Treasury Department official said separately it would not help to publish details while talks with Congress were underway. â\\x80\\x9cReleasing a Green Book of tax policy proposals as we work towards comprehensive tax reform would contradict that effort,â\\x80\\x9d the Treasury official said in an email. The last Green Book was issued by the Obama administration in February 2016 and ran 283 pages. Past Green Books going back to 1990 are available on the Treasury Department website. As a candidate, Trump, in his 125th day in power, promised voters that he would work with Congress and seek passage in his first 100 days of â\\x80\\x9cmassive tax reduction and simplification.â\\x80\\x9d He has not yet offered any tax legislation. On April 26, the administration released a one-page list of tax proposals summarized in 12 bullet points. Tuesdayâ\\x80\\x99s budget repeated the one-page summary, including a proposal to end the estate tax on inheritances paid by a few wealthy Americans. Despite this policy position, the Trump budget included a projection of $328 billion in estate tax revenues for 2018-2027. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve seen lots of tricky budgets before, but this may take the cake,â\\x80\\x9d said Democratic Senator Mark Warner. â\\x80\\x9cYou assume abolishment of the so-called death tax, estate tax, but ... you still count the revenues from the estate and gift tax, which is kind of a tricky thing. I would call that double-counting.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",
       " 'TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday that United Nations sanctions on North Korea needed to be firmly imposed. Abe, speaking to reporters, said that the international community must send a clear message to North Korea over its provocative actions. North Korea fired a missile on Friday that flew over Japan s northern Hokkaido far out into the Pacific Ocean, South Korean and Japanese officials said, further ratcheting up tensions after Pyongyang s recent test of a powerful nuclear bomb.

       " 'PARIS (Reuters) - France on Thursday condemned bombings by Syrian government forces and its allies against civilian populations in Idlib and Hama province, and called on Russia to abide by commitments it had made to de-escalate violence in the area.  These acts violate international humanitarian law,  foreign affairs ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne said in a statement.  France calls on Russia and the allies of the Damascus regime to respect the commitments made in Astana and to prevent these air strikes from continuing,  she added. The Russian Defence Ministry on Thursday denied allegations that Russian and Syrian jets had killed at least 150 civilians in over a week of bombing, saying it had been careful not to hit civilians.

       " 'Cable news is in trouble. The Pew Research Center reports that the median daily audience for Fox, CNN, and MSNBC is down about 11 percent since 2008.\\n\\nThe Washington Post\\'s Paul Farhi seesÂ\\xa0a grim future for the industry. He argues that cable news outlets are pretty much where newspapers were a decade ago: their audience is aging, their medium is being disrupted by new technologies, and the next generation of viewers is developing habits and preferences that they\\'re poorly placed to serve. (This is probably a good moment to note that I\\'m a contributor to MSNBC.)\\n\\nThe networks may still be making money â\\x80\\x94 in 2014, Fox News managed $1.2 billion in profits, while CNN cleared $300 million and MSNBC made a bit more than $200 million â\\x80\\x94 but Farhi suggests \"the cable news networks will face bankruptcy the same way Ernest Hemingway once described a characterâ\\x80\\x99s financial demise: \\'Gradually and then suddenly.\\'\"\\n\\nPerhaps that\\'s right. But while Farhi\\'s account of cable news outlets\\' woes focuses mainly on the cable part of the equation, it\\'s also worth considering the problems all three networks are having with the news itself.\\n\\nThe rise of the three major cable news networks were all driven by stories they dominated. CNN was made by the 1991 Gulf War. It wasn\\'t just the first time it passed the networks in ratings; it was the first time CNN showed that it could beat the networks in coverage. You can still feel the surprise in this New York Times article from 1991:\\n\\nThe shooting in the Persian Gulf began tonight with the three broadcast networks committed to covering the war on a 24-hour basis, although their image as news leaders was damaged by the Cable News Network\\'s early dominance of the coverage ... he networks\\' image was certainly not helped when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he was following the attacks on Baghdad on CNN. At least one network station, an NBC station in Detroit, decided to quit its network\\'s coverage to run CNN\\'s. And NBC finally was compelled to interview CNN reporters on the air to get information out of Baghdad.\\n\\nFox News, for its part, saw basically exponential growth around 9/11, and then again around the 2008 campaign and Obama\\'s election. MSNBC\\'s rise was driven by the backlash to the Bush administration, and particularly to the Iraq War:\\n\\nThe network held those gains in the first half of the Obama era, as liberals went from terrified to triumphant. But as liberals have gone from triumphant to a bit depressed and checked out, viewership has begun to decline.\\n\\nThe recent rise of cable news â\\x80\\x94 particularly Fox and MSNBC â\\x80\\x94 came in a period when the news â\\x80\\x94 particularly political news â\\x80\\x94 was unusually interesting.\\n\\nBetween 2000 and 2012, we saw a contested US presidential election, the largest terrorist attack ever on US soil, wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, repeated wave elections, a global financial crisis, the first black president, the rise of the Tea Party, the fight over Obamacare, and the first states to legalize gay marriage and marijuana â\\x80\\x94 and much more. It\\'s been a weirdly interesting, consequential period in American politics. And so the cable news networks, which could devote 24 hours a day to covering these stories, benefited.\\n\\nBut now it\\'s an unusually dull period in American politics. Congress is gridlocked, and is likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future. The US, thankfully, isn\\'t reeling from a terrorist attack or a financial crisis. We haven\\'t invaded Iran, at least not yet. And it\\'s not just cable news that\\'s losing viewers because of it. Turnout in the 2014 election was the lowest it\\'s been in 70 years.\\n\\nYou see this, I think, in the specific fortunes of the cable networks. Farhi reports that MSNBC lost 14 percent of its audience in 2014, and Fox lost 2 percent. But CNN prime time â\\x80\\x94 which swung away from politics toward covering plane crashes and airing documentaries â\\x80\\x94 is up 10 percent in 2015.\\n\\nWhich is all to say that Farhi may be right about the long-term decline of cable news â\\x80\\x94 over some extended period of time, both network and cable channels are going to be diminished by whatever it is the internet creates in their place.\\n\\nBut year to year, a lot of the ups and downs might just be the appeal of what\\'s actually in the news. If President Scott Walker goes to war with Iran, MSNBC\\'s ratings are going to go up. If President Hillary Clinton takes away everyone\\'s guns, Fox is going to boom. But for now, relative peace and stability are bad news for cable news.',\n",
       " 'Squat â\\x80\\x93 Image Source HOW TO : Stand with your feet hip distance apart. Engage your core as you push your hips back and down as if preparing to sit down. Drive everything through your heels as you come down and return to a standing position, ensuring that your knees do not push forward past your toes when coming down and that your back stays flat throughout. BENEFIT : Squats offer similar benefits to the glute bridge, but engage the muscles differently. Combined, they provide a comprehensive stretch/exercise. 3. Shoulder Opener Shoulder Opener â\\x80\\x93 Image Source HOW TO : Place a backwards facing chair approximately three feet in front of you (adjusting as necessary depending on your height). Stand with your feet hip distance apart. Lift your arms toward the sky, then slowly bend forward at your waist, grabbing the back of the chair with your outstretched arms. BENEFIT : Most of us sit at least slightly hunched over. Shoulder openers counteract this hunched position and open up the shoulders. 4. Cobra Cobra â\\x80\\x93 Image Source HOW TO : Lay on your stomach with your arms beside you, then bring your hands in line with your chest. With your hands pressed firmly against the ground, slowly bring your upper body off the floor while pressing your lower body into the ground through to the tips of your toes. Extend and hold for a few breaths before slowly lowering back down. BENEFIT : Cobra pose is a remarkable yoga stretch that strengthens your back while simultaneously stretching your chest and hip flexors. When done correctly, it essentially moves your muscles in the opposite direction of a sitting position. 5. Trunk Rotation Trunk Rotation â\\x80\\x93 Image Source HOW TO : Lie flat on your back with your arms and legs apart in a relaxed state. Slowly bring your knees to your chest. Let them both slowly fall to one side while your torso stays neutral. Hold for a few cycles of breath and then move to the other side. BENEFIT : This move fully stretches out your lower back, which is often the most negatively affected by prolonged sitting. 6. Pigeon Stretch Pigeon Stretch â\\x80\\x93 Image Source HOW TO : Starting in downward facing dog , bend one knee and place it on your mat slightly wider than your hip. Fold forward over your parallel shin while keeping the other leg extended behind you. BENEFIT : Pigeonâ\\x80\\x99s greatest benefit comes in its impact to your sitting posture moving forward. It strengthens and stretches your muscles in a way that should make sitting in a neutral position more natural than a compromised one. The Best Possible Solution In my (admittedly unprofessional) opinion, the best way to stay healthy is to be proactive rather than reactive. Instead of letting your ailments mount until they can no longer be ignored, take the time to do things now that prevent them from ever getting to that point. In addition to incorporating these stretches, find ways to break up the time you must spend sitting at work. Use a standing desk if one is available to you, go for a walk during lunch, and take short breaks throughout the day to stand up and stretch things out. Incorporating yoga into your weekly life is another fantastic preventative measure that not only builds strength and flexibility, but prevents future injury. If you arenâ\\x80\\x99t comfortable going to classes in your neighbourhood, try doing it at home. My personal favourite in-home video instructor is Rodney Yee. Through GAIAM, Rodney has created a number of easy-to-follow videos for people of all levels. SOURCES',\n",
       " 'DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said on Tuesday that Arab states that had imposed sanctions on his country in June over allegations of supporting terrorism were not interested in a solution to the crisis. Speaking to members of the Gulf Arab state s Shoura Council, Tamim said his government was preparing for elections to the consultative body. The necessary legislation would be ready in 2018. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar on June 5, accusing Doha of financing terrorism and cozying up to their arch-rival Iran. Qatar denies the charges.  We express our readiness for a compromise within the framework of a dialogue based on mutual respect for sovereignty and common obligations, but on the other hand we recognize that the indicators that come from the blockade states show they do not want to reach a solution,  Tamim said. The four countries have  put pressure and published rumors and fabrications  against Qatar hosting the World Cup in 2022. Tamim, who assumed office in 2013 after his father stepped down, also said his government was currently working on the instruments needed for elections, which he said would be ready in 2018. Plans for elections to the 45-member body originally envisaged for 2013 were never carried out. In his speech, Tamim also said his government was focusing on completing strategic projects to help the country cope with the sanctions imposed by its neighbors, including ports, water and food security, and to encourage investments.

       " 'Who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t like the idea of a luxury vacation? Ponying up the money for an upscale getaway, on the other hand, isnâ\\x80\\x99t nearly as appealing as going on one. Fortunately, says Joel Widzer, an expert on saving money on travel and the author of the book â\\x80\\x9cThe Penny Pincherâ\\x80\\x99s Guide to Luxury Travel,â\\x80\\x9d there are ways to cut the cost of a fancy trip. Here, he shares tips for a lavish getaway on a limited budget. BE A HOTEL LOYALIST. Favoring one hotel brand, such as Marriott, Starwood, Hilton or Hyatt, has major saving benefits, according to Mr. Widzer. â\\x80\\x9cHotel brands reward frequent guests who sign up for their loyalty programs with room upgrades, free hotel nights and free breakfast, and they even waive annoying fees such as the cost of valet parking,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Loyalty pays off at independently owned properties, too. If youâ\\x80\\x99re a traveler who returns to the same destination often, say Paris or Lake Tahoe, itâ\\x80\\x99s a good idea to keep staying at the same hotel there. Mr. Widzer, for example, used to stay at the same luxury boutique property on his frequent trips to Santiago, Chile, and by his third visit, he was treated to freebies such as a minifridge stocked with his favorite snacks, free airport transfers and upgrades to a   suite  â\\x80\\x94   perks worth several thousand dollars over time. USE CREDIT CARD POINTS ON   CHAIN HOTELS. Those points you accumulate every time you put a charge on your card arenâ\\x80\\x99t just good for buying airline tickets, Mr. Widzer said. With certain credit cards, travelers can redeem the points they earn for accommodations at luxury hotels, like using points earned on a Chase Ultimate Rewards card toward stays at   properties around the world. TRAVEL WHEN OTHERS ARENâ\\x80\\x99T. When destinations have fewer travelers, prices are lower. Head to Sardinia in August, for example, and   hotel rates and inflated prices are in store. But a trip in October means mild weather and prices at hotels and on services such as boat rentals that are up to 50 percent lower than during peak season. FOR AN EXOTIC DESTINATION OR A MULTICITY TRIP, CONSIDER A PACKAGE TOUR. Planning an upscale vacation without using a luxury tour provider for a major city or a popular destination such as Maui isnâ\\x80\\x99t difficult, but it is logistically harder to pull off an affordable yet lavish getaway to less common destinations such as Ethiopia or on themed multicity trips, such as the capital cities of the Eastern Bloc. In instances like these, Mr. Widzer said, itâ\\x80\\x99s cheaper to rely on a company that specializes in upscale tours (Abercrombie  Kent and Tauck are two). â\\x80\\x9cThese trips can be either group or private, and since these companies can negotiate favorable prices through their local contacts, their tours have a lot of   inclusions such as meals, tickets to cultural performances and    access to tourist attractions,â\\x80\\x9d he said.',\n",
       " 'On Wednesdayâ\\x80\\x99s broadcast of CNNâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cWolf,â\\x80\\x9d Senator Jeff Merkley ( ) stated that Judge Neil Gorsuchâ\\x80\\x99s nomination to the Supreme Court is a â\\x80\\x9c  scheme. â\\x80\\x9d And that if Gorsuch was principled, â\\x80\\x9che would have turned down this nomination, on the basis that the person who should be nominated is Merrick Garland. â\\x80\\x9d  Merkley said he would vote against Gorsuch because â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not going to be part of a   scheme. This seat, for the first time in US history, was stolen from one president and delivered to the next, with the hope of packing the court to the far right.

The first is that the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s team is under investigation for having potentially interfered in the US presidential election. If that turns out to be true, that is traitorous conduct. And that means that this conversation should be set aside until that is cleared up. And the second is, Gorsuch is way out of the mainstream. He hates class action lawsuits. He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want the LGBT community to be able to use the courts to end discrimination.

       " 'Kevin Shenkman could be described as one of the most prolific and successful civil rights lawyers of his generation, after almost   pushing dozens of Southern California communities to change their election systems under the California Voting Rights Act of 2001 (CVRA) over the past few years. [To many in those communities, however, Shenkman is a villain, a   from Malibu who is creating racial divisions where they do not exist  â\\x80\\x94   and making millions in the process.  He is, according to local podcaster Stephen Daniels, â\\x80\\x9cthe most hated man in Santa Clarita. â\\x80\\x9d And he is â\\x80\\x9chatedâ\\x80\\x9d there  â\\x80\\x94   and elsewhere  â\\x80\\x94   because he wins. Shenkman scored his latest victory last Wednesday evening, when the Oceanside City Council voted   to approve a proposal to move from an   system, where every council member is elected by the voters as a whole, to a district system, where voters are only represented directly by one member, from a particular geographic area. The change was prompted by a March 22 letter from Shenkman, claiming that the cityâ\\x80\\x99s   system prevented minority groups from winning elections, and warning of a lawsuit to follow. Residents of Oceanside were shocked, and angry, at the charge. The city has had several Latino council members, including one who has served on the council for the last 16 years. It also recently had an   mayor. Shenkman claimed in his letter to the city that Oceansideâ\\x80\\x99s 65. 2% white majority engaged in â\\x80\\x9cbloc votingâ\\x80\\x9d to exclude Latinos, and cited Linda Gonzales, who lost a city council race last year. Gonzales opposed Shenkmanâ\\x80\\x99s effort, and told Breitbart News that she believes lost her election fairly. She added that Shenkman never asked her permission to use her name. Nevertheless, the council members capitulated to Shenkmanâ\\x80\\x99s threat, after the city attorney advised them last Wednesday that no city or school board had ever successfully defended an   election system from a CVRA challenge in court. Score another win for Shenkman. His law firm, Shenkman  Hughes, boasts on its website that he â\\x80\\x9chas never lost a case, and has no intention of breaking that winning streak. â\\x80\\x9d Curiously, in his extensive bio on the website, which touts his work in â\\x80\\x9call aspects of intellectual property law, including litigation of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret matters,â\\x80\\x9d as well as other areas of civil litigation, he omits any mention of his voting rights cases (as of this writing). Shenkmanâ\\x80\\x99s path to law, and voting rights, are rather unconventional. Today, he lives in Malibu, one of the wealthiest communities in the state, whose population is over 90% white. But as he told the Talk of Santa Clarita podcast in January, he grew up in the Detroit area. There, he said, he was a â\\x80\\x9cbad kid,â\\x80\\x9d committing â\\x80\\x9cthe occasional little criminal misdemeanor kinda thing, maybe the occasional felony that I never got caught for. â\\x80\\x9d He had â\\x80\\x9csome interaction with the justice system,â\\x80\\x9d and formed a bond with his attorney, who inspired him to pursue a legal career. Shenkman graduated from Rice University with a B. S. in mechanical engineering (which he describes as â\\x80\\x9ccompletely uselessâ\\x80\\x9d) and went to Columbia Law School. He is married, with four daughters. He told Talk of Santa Clarita that if he were still practicing patent law, â\\x80\\x9cI would have shot myself by now,â\\x80\\x9d calling it â\\x80\\x9c  boring. â\\x80\\x9d Shenkmanâ\\x80\\x99s Facebook profile photo is an image of a giant metal fist: the Joe Louis monument in Detroit, Michigan. (His cover photo is the same image: â\\x80\\x9cFuck your FB rules,â\\x80\\x9d he explains in a comment to a relative.) His timeline features a photograph of Trayvon Martin, the black teenager who was killed while fighting neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012, who was later acquitted. He is a Democrat, and gave $1375 to the Los Angeles County Democratic Central Committee in 2014, according to the Federal Elections Commission. He has also contributed to Democrats at the state and local levels, according to the California Secretary of State. The public record also suggests that Shenkman has had a colorful career as a plaintiffâ\\x80\\x99s attorney, filing class action suits on behalf of consumers  â\\x80\\x94   and sometimes acting as the plaintiff himself. Currently, Shenkman and his law partner are plaintiffs in a class action suit filed last year against AutoZone, claiming that the auto parts dealer had not informed them that it was changing its rewards program so that a $20 credit on purchases over $20 would expire after one year. In 2014, he represented consumers in successful class action claims against restaurant chains that falsely advertised Kobe beef during a period when Japanese beef imports were banned. In 2011, Shenkman personally filed a consumer class action suit against Chipotle Mexican Grill, claiming that employees had misled him into believing the restaurantâ\\x80\\x99s pinto beans were vegetarian, when they are actually made with bacon. In his lawsuit, he cited his vegetarianism and Jewish faith (though Jewish dietary laws, which require that food be certified kosher by a rabbi, would not have permitted him to eat at Chipotle at all). That case was dismissed in 2015, more than four years later, according to court documents. He also reportedly sued the Chinese   chain Panda Express, claiming it failed to disclose that it adds chicken powder to its vegetarian entrees. That same year, he was the plaintiff  â\\x80\\x94   identified as an â\\x80\\x9cavid runnerâ\\x80\\x9d in media reports  â\\x80\\x94   in class action suits filed against coconut water companies Vita Coco and One World Enterprises, claiming they had exaggerated the hydration benefits of their products. Both cases were dismissed court documents indicate that he accepted a token settlement of $2, 000 in the Vida Coco case as part of a related nationwide class action settlement. Following those adventures in consumer litigation, Shenkman found a new issue to litigate: minority voting rights. Specifically, Shenkman turned his attention to the CVRA, a law signed in 2002 by Democratic Governor Gray Davis  â\\x80\\x94   who was later recalled by the California electorate  â\\x80\\x94   that made it easy for activists to sue towns, school boards, and other local government bodies with   voting. In addition, the CVRA allows plaintiffs to â\\x80\\x9cproveâ\\x80\\x9d that â\\x80\\x9cracially polarized voting occursâ\\x80\\x9d simply by showing that a member of a minority group might have won an election if not for being outvoted by members of the majority (usually white). The CVRA is a   law with a contentious history. Over a decade ago, in the Sanchez v. City of Modesto case, a state court found the CVRA unconstitutional. But that ruling was overturned on appeal in 2006, and the U. S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case, keeping the law intact. Among other questionable provisions, the CVRA includes incentives for lawyers to sue by allowing successful plaintiffâ\\x80\\x99s attorneys to recover their fees from the defendants, while preventing successful defendants from doing the same. For activist groups and ambitious lawyers, the CVRA is a   scheme but for local governments, it is a   scenario. They must pay their own legal fees, win or lose, and if they lose they must also pay the legal costs  â\\x80\\x94   often exorbitant  â\\x80\\x94   of the other side. For the first several years that the CVRA was in force, just two attorneys made â\\x80\\x9call of the roughly $4. 3 millionâ\\x80\\x9d that resulted from settlements under the law, according to the Associated Press. Those two attorneys just happened to be the two lawyers who drafted the law, including San   civil rights lawyer Robert Rubin. At some point, Shenkman apparently recognized the political and financial opportunity that the CVRA presented in Southern California. â\\x80\\x9cLike everything else, it just fell on me,â\\x80\\x9d he told Talk of Santa Clarita, recalling an early conversation with Antelope Valley Democratic Party activist Darren Parker. In 2012, Shenkman began suing cities and school districts throughout the region  â\\x80\\x94   most notably the city of Palmdale, which was likely seen as an easy target because   of its population are minorities, while its city council is largely white. Palmdale fought back, and the subsequent court fight set the template for other confrontations between Shenkman and his targets. At first, the city was defiant, fighting Shenkman in court and holding elections that a judge later declared were illegal. In the end, however, after being worn down by years of litigation and appeals, Palmdale agreed to a settlement that required it to pay $4. 5 million. (Curiously, one of the plaintiffsâ\\x80\\x99 other lawyers was R. Rex Parris, the mayor of the neighboring city of Lancaster, which still uses the   election system.) Since the Palmdale case, Shenkman told Voice of OC last year, he has been inundated with calls from potential plaintiffs. Some of Shenkmanâ\\x80\\x99s potential plaintiffs are local politicians. He told Voice of OC that he also works with the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, a   Latino organization (with a Los Angeles office) which he reportedly represented in at least one case. Shenkman uses the Palmdale case to push other cities into immediate compliance. In his letter to Oceanside, for example, he wrote: â\\x80\\x9cAs you may be aware, in 2012, we sued the City of Palmdale for violating the CVRA. After an   trial, we prevailed. After spending millions of dollars, a   remedy was ultimately imposed on the Palmdale city council, with districts that combine all incumbents into one of the four districts. â\\x80\\x9d Shenkman and his supporters argue that districts increase the chance that minority candidates will win elections, presuming people vote as racial blocs. Shenkman told Talk of Santa Clarita that the   system had been created in the early 20th century to â\\x80\\x9cfreeze outâ\\x80\\x9d minorities.   elections, according to Shenkman and to the few advocates who spoke in favor of districts at the Oceanside city council meeting, are also theoretically less expensive, lowering the barrier to entry for candidates. And with fewer constituents per public official, districts might allow more direct interaction between local voters and their elected representatives. (In Santa Clarita, Shenkman pushed for cumulative voting, in which voters can vote more than once for their preferred candidates, telling Talk of Santa Clarita that the system would be more likely than districts to elect Latinos to the city council.) Many residents, however, seem to prefer the   system. One reason, frequently cited by the opponents of Oceansideâ\\x80\\x99s proposed district system, is that every single member of a local government body under an   system is accountable to each voter. Some, like Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation, also argue that small communities share too much in common to be divided politically in ways that encourage politicians to favor their local neighborhoods over others. And many communities reject the idea that they are racist  â\\x80\\x94   or that they use â\\x80\\x9cbloc votingâ\\x80\\x9d to exclude minorities, as Shenkman alleges. They also dislike the drawing of districts using racial criteria, arguing it creates new divisions in the community  â\\x80\\x94   a frequent refrain among the opponents in Oceanside. More than the particular form of government, what many communities resent is the way they are being compelled to accept districts  â\\x80\\x94   through legal threats and accusations of racism. Oceanside Councilmember Jack Feller, who voted against the new system, told the Los Angeles Times that he felt â\\x80\\x9cdisgusted   â\\x80¦     that this is being forced on us. â\\x80\\x9d If Palmdale was an attractive target, Oceanside was a poor one. Just over a third of its residents are Latino, and there has been at least one Hispanic representative on the   city council for the last two decades. At the council meeting on Wednesday evening, many of the most vociferous opponents of the new plan were Hispanic. But the Palmdale case loomed large in the minds of the council members, who voted  â\\x80\\x94   narrowly  â\\x80\\x94   to surrender. Gonzales, the candidate whose name Shenkman used in his letter to the city, told Breitbart News that she felt he had exploited her for his own purposes. She said that she had reached Shenkman by telephone, and found him rude, until she explained who she was. At that point, she said, he expressed sympathy for her recent election loss. She told him she had lost because she was running against veteran incumbents, not because of racism. â\\x80\\x9cI told [Shenkman] that I agree we need to get more Latinos involved in the government, and in our democracy, and in our Constitution,â\\x80\\x9d but without special districts, Gonzales recalled. â\\x80\\x9cHe didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to talk to me after that. â\\x80\\x9d And she added: â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re working against the people theyâ\\x80\\x99re trying to help. â\\x80\\x9d That is a common sentiment in the communities Shenkman has confronted. In Palmdale, when Shenkman sued to stop city council elections in 2013, the city accused him of â\\x80\\x9cattempting to stop an election where at least one minority candidate is essentially guaranteed to win a seat on the City Council,â\\x80\\x9d given the field of candidates. The city attorney opined that Shenkmanâ\\x80\\x99s legal team was â\\x80\\x9conly interested in gouging the taxpayers to line their pockets. â\\x80\\x9d Shenkman later defended his payout to the Los Angeles Times: â\\x80\\x9cWe did very well on the Palmdale case. But people who criticized us donâ\\x80\\x99t realize the enormous risk that we took. â\\x80\\x9d (It is not clear what â\\x80\\x9criskâ\\x80\\x9d Shenkman was referring to, since  â\\x80\\x94   as noted above  â\\x80\\x94   the CRVA does not allow successful defendants to recover costs. He told Voice of OC: â\\x80\\x9cI was not paying my mortgage in order to pay the experts. And the court reportersâ\\x80\\x99 fees, and other stuff. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in    costs. â\\x80\\x9d Other lawyers, he said, might not have been â\\x80\\x9ccrazy enoughâ\\x80\\x9d to try.) Shenkman also told Talk of Santa Clarita that he â\\x80\\x9cembracedâ\\x80\\x9d the financial rewards of his voting rights cases, admitting that he posted a photograph of the check he received from Palmdale on his Facebook page with the caption: â\\x80\\x9cPicture me rollinâ\\x80\\x99 bitches. â\\x80\\x9d He has, at times, described his highly lucrative voting rights campaign in more idealistic,   even   terms. In a speech in 2013, he said: â\\x80\\x9cOther people have introduced me as just being the bad guy. They call [me] the   the ambulance chaser, some other names that are probably not even as nice as that. And all for seeking to allow racial and ethnic minorities   â\\x80¦     to have a say in their city governments, their school boards. â\\x80\\x9d He later admitted, however, to â\\x80\\x9cextortingâ\\x80\\x9d local governments, in an interview with Voice of OC: â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s all true   â\\x80¦     taking advantage of easy targets  â\\x80\\x94   yeah. There are a lot of easy targets, but they should change. If they change their election system, I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t need or have the opportunity to sue them. â\\x80\\x9d Since the Palmdale case, Shenkman has overturned   election systems throughout Southern California, most of which had been in place for many decades, without complaint. The Orange County Register called the changes a â\\x80\\x9chistoric upheaval,â\\x80\\x9d citing â\\x80\\x9cdozensâ\\x80\\x9d of local agencies that had been forced to change from   to district voting. Not even liberal cities are safe. Last year Shenkman sued the City of Santa Monica, which prides itself on its   â\\x80\\x9cprogressiveâ\\x80\\x9d politics, and which has a Latino mayor. Shenkmanâ\\x80\\x99s client in Santa Monica is Maria Loya, who has run unsuccessfully for local office. She is married to Oscar de la Torre, who claims he lost a race for city council in November 2016 because of the   system. (De la Torre came sixth in a race where the top four won seats Mayor Tony Vazquez won the   number of votes.) He is on the board of the Pico Neighborhood Association, which is also a plaintiff in the case. (In addition to Shenkman, one of the other lawyers for the plaintiffs is none other than CVRA   Robert Rubin himself another is Mayor Parris of Lancaster, once again.) Shenkman told Talk of Santa Clarita that the Democrats on the Santa Monica city council are â\\x80\\x9chypocritical. â\\x80\\x9d He added: â\\x80\\x9c[T]heyâ\\x80\\x99re saying the same   thingsâ\\x80\\x9d as the city of Palmdale . Last year, however, Shenkmanâ\\x80\\x99s lawsuit nearly derailed negotiations between Santa Monica and his home town of Malibu over the creation of a separate Malibu school district, something local activists in Malibu fervently desire. Initially, Shenkman was on Malibuâ\\x80\\x99s negotiating team. But when Shenkman filed his lawsuit, without warning, Santa Monica cut off talks. â\\x80\\x9c[T]his legal action could jeopardize our ability to move forward in a productive manner,â\\x80\\x9d the school board president said in a press release, reported at the time by the Santa Monica Daily Press. A group called Advocates for Malibu Public Schools, which had initially joined Shenkmanâ\\x80\\x99s lawsuit as plaintiffs, withdrew from the case, and Shenkman resigned as a member of the negotiating team, saying his involvement had become a â\\x80\\x9cdistraction. â\\x80\\x9d Given Shenkmanâ\\x80\\x99s unsparing style, perhaps Santa Monica should not have been surprised. When voters in the San Fernando Valley town of Glendale rejected a district system by a    margin in a 2015 referendum, Shenkman sued the school district. When the San Bernardino County town of Upland agreed to a settlement with Shenkman, which involved hiring demographers to draw districts that favored Latinos, they still had to pay legal fees. And when the Orange County city of Fullerton created districts, Shenkman went back to court to challenge the new boundaries. Shenkman has a brash style of speaking, and is not shy to express contempt for his legal and political opponents. On Talk of Santa Clarita, Shenkman referred disparagingly to local Latino politicians with whom he disagreed  â\\x80\\x94   in explicitly racial terms: â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think very highly of the crowd in Santa Clarita who are Latino by name only,â\\x80\\x9d he said, singling out   Republican Assemblyman Dante Acosta ( ) as â\\x80\\x9cone that comes to mind. â\\x80\\x9d Shenkman also made an astonishing allegation about a former State Senate candidate, Democrat Johnathon Ervin: Shenkman: And the Democrats that were up [for election] were horrible candidates. Daniels: Mmm. Shenkman: I mean, Johnathon Ervin is a horrible candidate. Daniels: Why do you say that? Shenkman: Heâ\\x80\\x99s got so many problems, man. First of all, the guy takes bribes, OK? Daniels: Ugh. Shenkman: You know  â\\x80\\x94   Daniels: Hey man, youâ\\x80\\x99re a lawyer. I mean, donâ\\x80\\x99t you at least want to say, â\\x80\\x9callegedlyâ\\x80\\x9d? Shenkman: No. He added, later in the interview, that he had received death threats, and threats to his family, as a result of his work on voting rights. But he was undeterred, and said he has many requests from local activists to confront their cities. In discussing the cities he has taken on, Shenkman seems to adopt an imperious tone, confident that he can shape outcomes to his will. When asked by Daniels about whether Santa Clarita could avoid a lawsuit by appointing a Latino member to the council, he said that it would depend on whom they appointed: I think it very much depends on who they appoint. And right now, as the council stands, there are four white, conservative Republicans of a similar mind. And that is not what the City of Santa Clarita is. I would love to see the city council have the kind of maturity to appoint someone who does not share all of their views  â\\x80¦     Maybe the fifth person should bring some diversity of ideas. Shenkman also vowed on Talk of Santa Clarita to depose the current Santa Clarita city council  â\\x80\\x94   which he claimed was elected unlawfully  â\\x80\\x94   eventually: â\\x80\\x9cAny time a city fights us to the bitter end, thatâ\\x80\\x99s the approach that we take. â\\x80\\x9d Ironically, Shenkmanâ\\x80\\x99s own town of Malibu has an   election system  â\\x80\\x94   the very system Shenkman is destroying elsewhere  â\\x80\\x94   and an apparently   city council. But not enough minorities live there: only 6. 1% of the population is Hispanic, and only 1. 2% is black. Ironically, that means the CVRA might not apply to Malibu. But perhaps the greatest irony is that for all of Shenkmanâ\\x80\\x99s legal work over the past five years, the new district systems are little better at electing minorities to office than the old   systems. Last month, the Times observed: â\\x80\\x9cA voting law meant to increase minority representation has generated many more lawsuits than seats for people of color. â\\x80\\x9d It added: â\\x80\\x9cOf the 22 cities that have made the move to district elections since June [2016] only seven saw an overall gain in Latino council members. â\\x80\\x9d And the reasons for poor Latino representation had nothing to do with racism, the Times reported: A number of factors likely contributed to the low numbers, including historically low turnout by Latino voters and a lack of candidates with the means to run, experts said. Also, even in cities with large Latino populations, some residents canâ\\x80\\x99t vote because they are too young, are here illegally or are not citizens. The threat of legal action has forced cities to switch to council districts, but in some cases the move hasnâ\\x80\\x99t resulted in more minority representation because the city already is   and drawing districts where minorities predominate is difficult. Shenkman told the Times that he had filed about ten lawsuits  â\\x80\\x94   and that, in the newspaperâ\\x80\\x99s words, he â\\x80\\x9ccouldnâ\\x80\\x99t remember how many warning letters he has sent to local governments. â\\x80\\x9d That campaign has upended local government in Southern California, and divided communities by race in ways that may linger for generations, but it has achieved almost nothing else  â\\x80\\x94   except making Kevin Shenkman richer. There are only two ways to stop Shenkman. One is to meet his challenge in court. Since 2013, the legal landscape has changed: the Supreme Court tossed part of the federal Voting Rights Act in 2013, in Shelby County v. Holder. In doing so, the Court emphasized the importance of evidence in determining whether there is racial discrimination in any particular jurisdiction. The Court could, theoretically, toss out the California Voting Rights Act for vagueness, since its evidentiary standards are so low that it allows virtually any candidate to challenge an election loss as racist. Given the wide impact of the CVRA across the state over the last few years, the Court might have also a greater interest in hearing a challenge than it did a decade ago. The confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch might also offer hope to defendants. But realistically, few local communities have the money to gamble on a Supreme Court win. That leaves one last recourse: the state legislature. The communities of Southern California could approach their elected representatives, Democrat and Republican, and ask them to amend the CVRA to require higher standards of proof of racism, or at least to remove the monetary incentives that reward lawyers like Shenkman for their exploits. On most issues, Democrats in Sacramento might not be inclined to listen to conservative cities in the Inland Empire or San Diego County. But Shenkman is pursuing liberal Santa Monica, too. There could be bipartisan interest in protecting local government from outside lawyers who can squeeze taxpayers with arguably frivolous lawsuits. Until then, Shenkman will keep going. As he said in 2013: â\\x80\\x9cThe law is the law. â\\x80\\x9d Shenkman did not reply to requests for comment. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

       " 'Alexander Rhodes sat along a stretch of grass, looking out over the Allegheny River. The two of us were sitting in a quiet space on the outskirts of Pittsburgh where we had planned to spend the night in tents camping out. â\\x80\\x9cThe key thing to consider is that I am not a very good businessman,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not really anything but a guy who was addicted to internet porn. â\\x80\\x9d A few years ago, Mr. Rhodes, 26, founded a website as an online space meant to help others who share his particular problem. It has about one million unique visitors each month, he said, and nearly breaks even. Mr. Rhodes, who grew up in western Pennsylvania and worked at Google until recently, is now hoping to make his site into something larger. With the help of his father and other family members, he is transforming part of an abandoned church into a base of operations for his fledgling company. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s one thing to look back and regret what happened in terms of growing up, being addicted to internet porn,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cYou might look back and be like: â\\x80\\x98Oh, man. I was a loser. And if I never watched it, my life would be so much better.â\\x80\\x99 And maybe thatâ\\x80\\x99s true. But at the same time, the fact that I was addicted to internet porn, the fact that I was so mediocre, makes me uniquely qualified to help humanity. â\\x80\\x9d In recent years, Mr. Rhodes has emerged as a spokesman against a â\\x80\\x9cdiseaseâ\\x80\\x9d that hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been officially recognized by the medical establishment. He seemed uneasy with his new status. He was careful with every word and asked to go off the record more than a government official. He would not confirm whether he was involved with someone, saying only that, since giving up pornography â\\x80\\x9cfor goodâ\\x80\\x9d in 2013, he has been able to have meaningful relationships with women. In some ways, his story is that of the digital age. His father was a computer programmer, and he was exposed to digital technology from early on. He gravitated to Nintendo Game Boy and eventually moved to the Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation. At 11 or so, he said, he clicked on a banner ad by mistake and found an image depicting rape. By the time he had reached adolescence, so had the internet, and Mr. Rhodes came to rely on   pornography that was easy to find and often free. By college, he was masturbating while watching it up to 14 times a day, he said. â\\x80\\x9cI would say, â\\x80\\x98O. K. I have to take a few days to recover from this, like physically recover,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cand I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t last for even a day. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Rhodesâ\\x80\\x99s seeming dependence on porn didnâ\\x80\\x99t help matters with his first girlfriend, whom he started dating when he was a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh. It was his first real chance for sustained intimacy, and he blew it. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think it was all due to internet porn,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cBut I can tell you that the sex life didnâ\\x80\\x99t go very well. I had   erectile dysfunction  â\\x80\\x94   a very mild form, and this is all very   because doctors wonâ\\x80\\x99t diagnose this  â\\x80\\x94   but I was able to maintain an erection by fantasizing about pornography. That was the only way. â\\x80\\x9d In 2011, Mr. Rhodes was lost and in search of support. He created a discussion forum on Reddit on the topic of abstaining from masturbation and pornography. He realized he was far from alone and began his   site soon after. After college, he continued to build the site while working as a contractor for Google, specializing in data analysis. He said he earned good money and was able to put a good amount into the website (called NoFap. com, from a slang term for masturbation). But he was still using the supposed vice he was railing against. It took another failed relationship to get him to quit. â\\x80\\x9cI think I was relying on pornography as some kind of emotional crutch,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIf anything bad would happen, you would go to porn, because it would always be there. â\\x80\\x9cI knew it was bad for me,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cBut I also realized it was bad for women I was involved with, and that was the moment that I said: â\\x80\\x98I need to leave this thing behind. It is completely distorting my sexuality to the point where it could actually be harmful or at least not enjoyable for other people who I am involved with. â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Rhodes came to believe he had a calling greater than his work in data analysis at Google. â\\x80\\x9cIt wasnâ\\x80\\x99t an easy decision,â\\x80\\x9d he said of his leaving the job last year. â\\x80\\x9cBut ultimately it was what was best for humanity. â\\x80\\x9d The website serves as an online umbrella for men looking to escape pornography. It has advertisements for   software and online programs that promote the idea of steering clear of pornography and masturbation. The site also has discussion forums and includes testimonials by men sharing stories of their successes and failures. And it helps match men with â\\x80\\x9caccountability partnersâ\\x80\\x9d meant to serve as Alcoholics   sponsors, to keep a person on the right path. The site generates revenue through subscriptions and advertising, Mr. Rhodes said. To make it into something more robust, Mr. Rhodes needed to â\\x80\\x9ccome outâ\\x80\\x9d as a spokesman of sorts. After he appeared in a New York magazine article in 2013 about men who had quit masturbating, he told his mother what was going on, much to her horror. Other interviews followed. While his family remains supportive, there are limits. When he showed his mother a recent article in Time magazine in which he was quoted, she said, joking, â\\x80\\x9cI shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be reading these types of things about my son,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Rhodes said, recalling his motherâ\\x80\\x99s reaction. On the first day I visited Mr. Rhodes, we climbed the stairs of the former St. Clement Church in Tarentum, Pa. The structure, built in 1906, had long since been abandoned, its pews, confessional and attached school crumbling and gathering dust. His father, Phillip Rhodes, had recently bought the sprawling complex at auction for $50, 000. While the church is likely to house other businesses, the younger Mr. Rhodes sees a future there for him and a fully staffed operation. He sat on one side of the church confessional while I sat on the other. â\\x80\\x9cTell me the last time you watched porn,â\\x80\\x9d I said, joking. Despite the location, he has largely kept away from religious people, especially evangelicals wanting to team up with him, even though such a relationship could help fund his work. â\\x80\\x9cI have viewpoints that donâ\\x80\\x99t mesh with their viewpoints,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Rhodes said. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m very  . Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a religious person. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not someone who supports religion. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not against religion, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t support it. And I completely, firmly believe in premarital sex. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Rhodes said he has also endured the wrath of those on the other end of the ideological spectrum. People have tried  â\\x80\\x94   and failed  â\\x80\\x94   to hack the siteâ\\x80\\x99s servers, and its forums have been bombarded with pornographic images, he said. His father received pornography in the mail, Mr. Rhodes said, and he himself has gotten death threats. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s just something you have to deal with and let the proper authorities follow up on anything,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Soon it would grow terribly cold, making for a terrible night of sleep in spite of a tent and a supposedly insulated sleeping bag that I bought at a suburban Target. On the morning of our second day, Mr. Rhodes sat near the extinguished campfire from the night before, laptop on his knees. Soon weâ\\x80\\x99d be departing the campsite, heading back to the city, to â\\x80\\x9ccivilization. â\\x80\\x9d But first he had to present a webinar for another   outfit. During the chat, he spoke with people who asked about avoiding triggers. As the session continued, he spoke less about pornography than about the need to take care of oneself, both physically and emotionally. He talked about developing good habits and routines, about changing oneâ\\x80\\x99s life in general.

       " 'BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers have raised concerns over money laundering in Malta and the independence of its police and judiciary in a draft resolution, stepping up pressure on the island after the assassination of an investigative journalist. Daphne Caruana Galizia, who had denounced high-profile corruption and accused Prime Minister Joseph Muscat of wrongdoing, was killed on Oct. 16 by a bomb that tore through her car.  An investigation is under way and Muscat has promised that everything will be done to find the killers. Next week the EU parliament will vote on a resolution on the rule of law in Malta. In a draft text, seen by Reuters, the parliament said it  regrets that developments in Malta in recent years have led to serious concerns about the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights including freedom of the media and the independence of the police and judiciary . It said that  the independence of law enforcement and the judiciary in Malta may be compromised by the fact that the government is empowered to appoint the Police Commissioner, the head of the FIAU (anti-money laundering agency) and the attorney-general . The resolution called on the European Commission to oversee more closely respect for the rule of law in Malta and regretted the EU executive s decision not to publish its anti-corruption report this year. At a news conference on Friday, the largest group in the parliament, the conservative European People s Party (EPP), called on the EU commission to  urgently  step up its monitoring of Malta.  We think there are serious questions regarding the freedom of media and the lack of law enforcement in Malta,  said Daniel Koster, an EPP spokesman. He said the EPP had doubts about what the commission was doing to address this situation. The calls from the conservatives were echoed by the liberal, leftist and green groupings in the assembly. Reports from the Maltese anti-money laundering agency were leaked in June via Caruana Galizia s blog. They raised concerns about Pilatus Bank, a Maltese lender accused of having failed to report suspicious dealings as required by law. The EU lawmakers  draft resolution calls on Malta to investigate Pilatus Bank. The bank and the Maltese police did not reply to Reuters  questions on the allegations.  There appear to be no grounds to suspect a systematic breach,  of money laundering rules in Malta, an EU Commission official told Reuters in reply to questions over the island s application of EU rules on money laundering. The draft resolution, citing findings of the parliament s inquiry committee on money laundering, said Maltese institutions in charge of enforcing rules to prevent financial crimes were  highly politicized .  The number of convictions and confiscations related to money laundering in Malta seems extremely low,  it said. ',\n",

       " 'TAPA, Estonia (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May urged the European Union on Friday to respond in kind to proposals she set out in Italy last week that sought to unlock Brexit talks, saying forming a new partnership was in the bloc s interest as well.  Speaking to Reuters in Estonia after meeting British troops, May said she believed the speech in Florence a week ago had given new momentum to the troubled divorce negotiations and had seen signs to suggest it had broken the deadlock. But she did not say whether she thought it was enough to     move the talks on to a discussion of the future relationship by an October summit after EU negotiators said again this week that not enough progress had been made.  A week ago I gave a speech in Florence which set out how we have made good progress so far, I thought we could make further progress and moving on to looking at the future deep and special relationship and partnership that we want to build with the European Union when the UK has left the EU,  she said.  I made that speech to give momentum to the talks and I think we have seen that being shown in the talks that have taken place this week and further progress has been made.  Following the latest round of talks this week, the EU s top negotiator said May s speech had created a  new dynamic , but more progress was needed to move to the next phase of discussions. May, weakened by a June election when she lost her Conservative Party s majority, hopes to use the informal summit in Estonia to talk to EU leaders about Brexit, and to underline Britain s role in European security to try to win goodwill. Standing beside French President Emmanuel Macron and Estonia s Juri Ratas, she chatted to some of the 800 troops Britain has deployed at a military base in Tapa, northern Estonia, as part of NATO s moves to defend against a newly assertive Russia on the EU s border.  By focusing on defense in Tallinn, May will want to show that Britain has something to offer its European neighbors and will say she is ready to share British expertise - including through the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) - to help EU nations build up their own cyber-security capability. That, she hopes, could bolster her argument for pushing the Brexit talks forward.   I set out what I thought was the future deep and special partnership we can build with the EU and I look for the speech that I set out for that being reciprocated in proposals that the EU will come forward with,  she said.

While the FBI move appears to be an effort to be more transparent, they ve refueled old conspiracy suspicions   hidden in plain sight.   COVER-UP?    Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton To this day, the attacks on September 11th, 2001, have remained some of the most enigmatic crimes of the century.There has been an endless dispute over the how of 9/11 and the who, as well as the various methods used to carry out the atrocities of that day. There s an even heavier debate over what brought down WTC Building 7 and since then, other 9/11  rabbit holes  have also challenged the nature of the planes said to be involved in both New York and Washington DC.Whatever your thoughts are concerning planes or other theories on 9/11 it s still worth noting that even the mainstream media admitted at the time that there was, no evidence of a plane at all,  following the destruction of a portion of the Pentagon s western side.Watch as Jamie McIntyre, a former Senior Pentagon correspondent for CNN, suggests the lack of evidence supporting the official story surrounding American Airlines flight 77 .Here s one telling image released by the FBI that doesn t appear to support the official story of American Airlines flight 77 s fuselage crashing into the Western side of the Pentagon. Its as if logic and reason were also casualties on 9/11   where is the rest of the plane and why is the crater so small?  PENTAGON TALES    What really happened here? (Image Source: vault.fbi.gov)In another telling image, part of the damage seen at the Pentagon on 9/11 looks errily reminiscent to that of the Oklahoma City bombing  INTERIOR EXPLOSION?   Why does this look similar to the damage at OKC IN 1995? (Image Source: abcnews)The FBI releases also contained images of twisted plane parts that curiously lacked evidence of fire damage   given the devastating crime scene, it s hard to see how that would be possible.See the FBI photos here for yourself   and ask yourself one single question: where is the Boeing passenger airliner? . More from Free Thought Project below BREAKING: The FBI Just Released Never Before Seen Photos of 9/11 Pentagon WreckageClaire Bernish Free Thought ProjectAfter surreptitiously releasing to the public one week ago, the FBI unceremoniously announced today the unprecedented release of never-before-seen images from the attacks of September 11, 2001, and some of the pictures evoke still more questions.Others could be seen as putting to rest a popular theory American Airlines Flight 77 never actually smashed into the Pentagon. The FBI Vault release is minute in size, to say the least   with a mere 27 images comprising the file   and does not include video, audio, nor anything other than photos.But, given the stony silence from the U.S. government toward families of victims of the attacks, even the meager disclosure is a welcome morsel of information with the potential to provide answers.Indeed, in the very first image, labeled plainly,  9-11 Pentagon Debris 1,  a single piece of wreckage sits isolated on a parcel of lawn   bearing the American Airlines logo and marked with letters and numbers.More from Free Thought Project here SEE ALSO: What to Expect From BBC Panorama and Guardian s Whitewash of UK Gov t Funding Terrorists in SyriaSEE ALSO: The Guardian Exposed   Conning Public into Financing  Independent Journalism SEE ALSO: White Helmets &  Local Councils    Is the UK FCO Financing Terrorism in Syria with Taxpayer Funds?SEE ALSO: A Guide to Mainstream Media  Fake News  War PropagandaSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ',\n",

The case gripped the entire world, becoming one of the most high profile missing persons cases in history. Coverage of her kidnapping was comparable to the press interest in the death of Princess Diana. \\nThe circumstantial evidence goes far beyond the striking resemblance. \\nJohn Podestaâ\\x80\\x99s first email on Wikileaks is dated May 4th 2007. \\nPer Wikipedia Madeline disappeared May 3rd 2007. \\nDid John Podesta WIPE HIS EMAILS the day after Madeline disappeared to destroy evidence? \\nThe abduction occurred in Portugal, where Wikileaks emails show was a destination Podesta traveled to. \\nIn addition, extensive evidence points to the Podesta Brothers having close connections to those involved with potential crimes or at least bizarre rituals involving underaged children. \\nWatch this video: \\nThe Clinton foundation has long standing ties to convicted Haiti Child Trafficker Laura Silsby. \\nWe also know for a fact John Podesta, Hillaryâ\\x80\\x99s Campaign Chair, has close family ties to convicted serial child molester Denny Hastert . \\nIn the email below, Podestaâ\\x80\\x99s brother mentions Denny, saying heâ\\x80\\x99s remained â\\x80\\x9cCLOSEâ\\x80\\x9d to him. \\nDenny Hastert was a wrestling coach who was referred to by his sentencing judge as a â\\x80\\x9cserial child molester.â\\x80\\x9d \\nThese are the people who the Hillary campaign, and their family members call friends and keep in â\\x80\\x9cclose touch with.â\\x80\\x9d \\nItâ\\x80\\x99s disgusting. \\nRecently former Navy Seal Erik Prince told Breitbart News that according to one of his â\\x80\\x9cwell-placed sourcesâ\\x80\\x9d in the New York Police Department, â\\x80\\x9cThe NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were makingâ\\x80\\x9d in the Anthony Weiner investigation, but received â\\x80\\x9chuge pushbackâ\\x80\\x9d from the Justice Department. \\nPrince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s email server last week. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,â\\x80\\x9d Prince claimed. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,â\\x80\\x9d he said. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, â\\x80\\x98Weâ\\x80\\x99re going to go public with this if you donâ\\x80\\x99t reopen the investigation and you donâ\\x80\\x99t do the right thing with timely indictments,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Prince explained. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe â\\x80\\x93 I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York â\\x80\\x93 the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and theyâ\\x80\\x99ve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,â\\x80\\x9d Prince said. \\nErikâ\\x80\\x99s claim parallels what Steve Pieczenik states about the Clinton Pedophilia Connection. \\nWere the Podestas involved with the abduction of Madeline Mccann?

       " 'Michael Jordan is quite possibly the best basketball player to ever live. Now, he is using both his fame and fortune to fight against the killings of unarmed black men by law enforcement as well as violent attacks against police officers.Jordan made his powerful statements in an essay posted at The Undefeated. He began by condemning the violence against both American-Americans and law enforcement. As a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement and angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers,  he began.The famed athlete continued, saying that he is  saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late.  I know this country is better than that, and I can no longer stay silent,  he said.  We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers   who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all   are respected and supported. Jordan explained that because of his experiences with the police officers who have protected his family over the years he has  seen up close the dedication of the law enforcement officers  and has the  greatest respect for their sacrifice and service.  But he then went on to say that as he knows that many African-Americans   experiences with law enforcement have been different than mine. I have decided to speak out in the hope that we can come together as Americans, and through peaceful dialogue and education, achieve constructive change,  wrote Jordan.In an effort to help find a way to put an end to the violence, Jordan announced that he is putting his money where his mouth is and donating $1 million each to the International Association of Chiefs of Police s newly established Institute for Community-Police Relations and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. The Institute for Community-Police Relations  policy and oversight work is focused on building trust and promoting best practices in community policing,  Jordan explained.  My donation to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the nation s oldest civil rights law organization, will support its ongoing work in support of reforms that will build trust and respect between communities and law enforcement. Jordan said that he knows these contributions will not solve the problems plaguing our country, but he is hoping that his donations  will help both organizations make a positive difference. We are privileged to live in the world s greatest country   a country that has provided my family and me the greatest of opportunities,  Jordan concluded.  The problems we face didn t happen overnight and they won t be solved tomorrow, but if we all work together, we can foster greater understanding, positive change and create a more peaceful world for ourselves, our children, our families and our communities. Jordan s essay and donations come in the wake of deadly attacks on police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge following the fatal police shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile.Featured image via Streeter Lecka/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials have kicked off a new round of raids intended to deport hundreds of Central American mothers and children who have entered the country illegally, according to a legal group that works with the immigrants. Immigration enforcement officers as of Friday had arrested about 40 women and children encompassing at least 18 Central American family groups in Texas, North Carolina, South Dakota and possibly other states, said Laura Lichter, an immigration lawyer and a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Reuters reported on May 12 that the raids were planned for May and June and likely would be the largest deportation sweep targeting immigrant families by the administration of President Barack Obama this year after similar raids in which 121 people were arrested over two days in January. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea declined to confirm that the new round of raids had begun but defended the administrationâ\\x80\\x99s deportation operations as a whole. â\\x80\\x9cWe stress that these operations are limited to those who were apprehended at the border after January 1, 2014, have been ordered removed by an immigration court, and have no pending appeal or pending claim for asylum,â\\x80\\x9d Elzea said. The immigrants arrested in the latest raids have been sent to two ICE detention centers in Texas, according to Belle Woods, a spokeswoman for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The deportation operations are intended to deter illegal immigration from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and curb crossings of the U.S.-Mexican border by Central Americans, U.S. officials have said. Lichter said ICE was not following its own policy in the raids. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the same thing we saw in January. These people deserve asylum, but didnâ\\x80\\x99t get a proper chance to have their cases heard,â\\x80\\x9d Lichter said. The issue of illegal immigration has figured prominently in the U.S. presidential campaign, with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump promising to deport all roughly 11 million people who are in the United States illegally. The White House on May 13 defended its deportation policy after complaints from Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and congressional leaders that the sweep targeting Central American illegal immigrants is inhumane. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m against large-scale raids that tear families apart and sow fear in communities,â\\x80\\x9d Clinton said at the time.

The kicker is the Census Bureau paid Gregory  a whopping $1,400 to  share a wealth of history as a Civil Rights Activist.  So he got paid to offend anyone who s not black unreal!The U.S. government paid a controversial civil rights activist/comedian to deliver an anti-white racist tirade at a major federal agency during Black History month and Judicial Watch has obtained the disturbing transcript of the offensive political rant.It took place at the United States Census Bureau earlier this year and the paid speaker was Dick Gregory, a self-professed humanitarian and drum major for justice who claims that his social satire changed the way white Americans perceive African American comedians. But Gregory s angry outburst at the Census Bureau was not funny to some employees and the agency was forced to explain that it will thoroughly review its procedures for selecting future speakers to  ensure their views are appropriate for the federal workplace.  Gregory also said whites stole black inventions, such as ice hockey and the cotton gin, and accused the U.S. government of conspiring to kill Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio. The movie King Kong is really a depiction of former heavyweight champion Jack Johnson dating white women, Gregory claimed at the Census Bureau performance, and whites treat President Obama  like dirt  and  like he s a Redneck Cracker that can t read or write.  Gregory delivered most of his routine in Ebonics (also known as African American Vernacular English) and advised his black audience not to obey  white racist cops,  which he also referred to as  filth. The rioters who destroyed Ferguson after a cop fatally shot a black man with an extensive criminal record who had just committed a robbery, didn t steal enough merchandise from the businesses they looted, Gregory told his government audience.  I was complaining about Ferguson because the N_ _ _ _ _ _ wasn t getting enough,  Gregory said, according to the transcript obtained by JW.

No rebellion is put together, predicated, on some White person shooting a Black person and that tips it off. Those was riots, riots. Gregory also told his audience of public servants that if he were president of the United States no white people would be in his cabinet.

       " 'ISTANBUL  â\\x80\\x94   The Islamic State on Monday issued a rare claim of responsibility for an attack in Turkey after a New Yearâ\\x80\\x99s Day shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed at least 39 people, describing the gunman who carried out the assault  â\\x80\\x94   and who has not been identified or captured  â\\x80\\x94   as â\\x80\\x9ca hero soldier of the caliphate. â\\x80\\x9d The Turkish authorities are still searching for the gunman, who killed a police officer guarding the Reina nightclub before going on a shooting rampage with a   rifle, but the state news media reported that eight suspects had been detained in connection with the attack. The authorities on Monday released two photographs of the person suspected of being the gunman, captured by security cameras, that showed a   cleanshaven man in a dark winter coat. The governmentâ\\x80\\x99s spokesman, Numan Kurtulmus, said at a news conference that investigators believed they found the assailantâ\\x80\\x99s fingerprints and that they were close to identifying him. Mr. Kurtulmus did not mention the Islamic State specifically, but he said Turkey would press the fight against terrorism. Referring to the attack, which happened just after midnight on Sunday morning, Mr. Kurtulmus said: â\\x80\\x9cThe fact that it was done during the first minutes of 2017 gives an important message. The message is, â\\x80\\x98We will go on to menace Turkey in 2017.â\\x80\\x99 And we say to them, we will break into your caves wherever you are. â\\x80\\x9d The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported on Monday that the gunman might be from Kyrgyzstan or elsewhere in Central Asia. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted Aiymkan Kulukeyeva, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Kyrgyzstan, as saying, â\\x80\\x9cAccording to preliminary information, this information is doubtful, but we are checking all the same. â\\x80\\x9d The Islamic State asserted in a statement that the attack had been carried out â\\x80\\x9cin continuation of the blessed operations that the Islamic State is conducting against Turkey, the protector of the cross. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cA hero soldier of the caliphate attacked one of the most famous nightclubs, where Christians celebrated their pagan holiday,â\\x80\\x9d read the statement from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. â\\x80\\x9cThey used hand grenades and a machine gun and transformed their celebration to mourning. â\\x80\\x9d In an apparent reference to Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s role in the conflict in Syria, the statement warned that â\\x80\\x9cthe government of Turkey should know that the blood of Muslims, which it is targeting with its planes and its guns, will cause a fire in its home by Godâ\\x80\\x99s will. â\\x80\\x9d The statement did not name the assailant, and it was not clear whether the Islamic State had organized the attack or had merely inspired the gunman. But the shooting came just days after a   State group, the Nashir Media Foundation, published the latest in a series of messages calling for attacks on clubs, markets and movie theaters. The Islamic Stateâ\\x80\\x99s claim of responsibility came after years of complex relations between the Turkish state and the jihadist group operating across its southern border. Several terrorist attacks in Turkey over the last year have been attributed to the Islamic State, but the militant group rarely claims responsibility for major attacks in the country. A rare exception came in November, when the group claimed to be behind a deadly car bombing in southeastern Turkey. Analysts said that the Islamic State has walked a fine line in Turkey, trying to balance its goal of destabilizing the country without antagonizing the government to the extent that it would crack down heavily. For years, Turkey looked the other way, according to analysts and regional diplomats, as jihadist groups moved fighters and supplies across the border, establishing deep networks in Turkish border towns. Committed to supporting the uprising against President Bashar   of Syria, Turkey felt the jihadists could be managed while they fought with forces loyal to the Syrian government. But that policy ultimately changed, as Turkey worked to secure its borders, under pressure from its allies as it took in millions of Syrian refugees and as terrorist attacks rocked the country. Turkey began a military intervention in northern Syria in August that put its forces on the front lines against Kurdish militants as well as Islamic State fighters. This turned the jihadists decidedly against Turkey, prompting their leaders to call for attacks there. The Turkish military said on Monday that it had struck Islamic State targets in Syria, killing at least 22 militants. American intelligence officials had recently expressed concern about a possible attack in Turkey, warning in a statement on Dec. 22 that extremist groups were â\\x80\\x9ccontinuing aggressive efforts to conduct attacks throughout Turkeyâ\\x80\\x9d in areas where American citizens and expatriates lived or visited. That warning came three days after a gunman, described by Turkish officials as a      police officer, assassinated Andrey G. Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, at an art gallery in the capital, Ankara. The gunman shouted â\\x80\\x9cGod is great!â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t forget Aleppo, donâ\\x80\\x99t forget Syria!â\\x80\\x9d during the attack, which was captured on video. The   Anadolu news agency said that 38 of the 39 people who died in the attack on Sunday had been identified, The Associated Press reported. At least two dozen of the people killed were said to be foreigners.',\n",

       " 'Posted on October 27, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 10 Comments \\nIf we go by most of the MSM/corporate polls, Hillary Clinton will win on November 8. \\nBut there are dissenting voices. Among them is Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams , whoâ\\x80\\x99s still predicting a 98% chance of not just a Trump win, but a landslide. Interestingly, the dissenters also include a flaming leftist â\\x80\\x94 docu-maker Michael Moore. \\nMoore is loathsome, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t think anyone has captured or articulated the reasons why so many Americans resonate to Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s anti-globalism as well as Moore. \\nBelow is an excerpt from a recent speech Moore delivered, followed by my transcription: \\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know a lot of people in Michigan that are planning to vote for Trumpâ\\x80¦. They donâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily like him that much and they donâ\\x80\\x99t necessarily agree with him. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re not racists and rednecks certainly; theyâ\\x80\\x99re actually pretty decent people. And so I wanted to, after talking to a number of them, I wanted to write this. \\nDonald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said, â\\x80\\x98If you close these factories youâ\\x80\\x99re planning to do in Detroit and build them in Mexico, [when Iâ\\x80\\x99m President] Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobodyâ\\x80\\x99s gonna buy them.â\\x80\\x99 \\nIt was an amazing thing to see. No politician, Republican or Democrat, had ever said anything like that to these executives, and it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, the Brexit states. You live here in Ohio, you know what Iâ\\x80\\x99m talking about. \\nWhether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because heâ\\x80\\x99s saying the things to people who are hurting. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why every beaten-down, nameless, forgotten working stiff â\\x80\\x94 what used to be part of what was called the middle class â\\x80\\x94 loves Trump. He is the human Molotov cocktail that theyâ\\x80\\x99ve been waiting for, the human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them. And on November 8th, Election Day, although they lost their jobs, although theyâ\\x80\\x99ve been foreclosed on by the bank, next came the divorce, and now the wife and kids are gone, the carâ\\x80\\x99s been repoâ\\x80\\x99ed, they havenâ\\x80\\x99t had a real vacation in years, theyâ\\x80\\x99re stuck with the shitty Obamacare plan when you canâ\\x80\\x99t even get a fucking [inaudible]. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve essentially lost everything they had, except one thing. The one thing that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution â\\x80\\x94 the right to vote. \\nThey might be penniless, they might be homeless, they might be fucked over and fucked up. It doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter because itâ\\x80\\x99s equalized on that day. A millionaire has the same number of votes as the person without a job â\\x80\\x94 one. And thereâ\\x80\\x99s more of the former middle class than there are in the millionaire class. \\nSo on November 8th, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain and take that lever or felt pen or touchscreen and put a big fucking X in the box by the name of the man who is threatening to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump. \\nThey see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump. Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The media hates Trump, after they loved him and created him and now hate him. Thank you, media. \\nThe enemy of my enemy is who Iâ\\x80\\x99m voting for on November 8. Yes, on November 8, you, Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Billy Blow, Billy Bob Blow â\\x80\\x94 all the Blows get to blow up the whole goddamn system because itâ\\x80\\x99s your right. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s election is going to be the biggest fuck-you ever recorded in human history, and it will feel good.â\\x80\\x9d \\nPerversely, after articulately so beautifully the profound alienation of so many Americans and why Trump speaks for them, Michael Moore then proceeded to make a whole-hog defense and endorsement of Hillary Clinton. \\nHereâ\\x80\\x99s a screenshot from a video showing â\\x80\\x9cJabba the Hutâ\\x80\\x9d Michael Moore making the speech you heard and read above. \\nWhat if Trump loses? \\nBelow are excerpts from a powerful essay, â\\x80\\x9c The Elite â\\x80\\x98Have No Ideaâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94 Society is Near the Breaking Point ,â\\x80\\x9d written by a guy who calls himself Chindit13 for ZeroHedge : \\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat I find most surprising today is that the insiders and the elite have no idea what is percolating just beneath the surface . Okay, maybe their arrogance actually produces its own fog, so it should not come as a surprise that they are blinded. They do not look at the calendar, which, if one really looks, says â\\x80\\x981788â\\x80\\x99 on it. Something is close. Very close. Society is near the breaking point. \\nMy own experience is that Hillaryâ\\x80\\x99s so-called Deplorables are actually the most reserved, most polite, and most honest demographic in the country . They are more informed, more self-reliant, and among other things, better armed. Regarding their arms, they are incredibly responsible, and not the source of the violence for which the implement, and not the person, is too often blamed. The Deplorables have the longest fuse. It is, however, a fuse. [â\\x80¦] \\nThe Deplorables, however, are not possessed of infinite patience. Like a capacitor, there is a charge building, and at some point it will be released into the circuitry of society. \\nThe media and other insiders believe themselves to be immune. That thought no doubt results from being immersed inside a cocoon where dissonant voices are not allowed. When the levee breaks, or the capacitor releases its charge, they are going to be gob smacked. \\nPrecious few of them are anywhere near as immune as they believe themselves to be. Additionally, what they might think, or hope, is their support, their security, their safe space, doesnâ\\x80\\x99t really exist. \\nMost of societyâ\\x80\\x99s guardians, whether they are law enforcement or military, are card-carrying members of the Deplorables. \\nFrance was similarly constructed in the late 1780s. The elite were isolated only in thought, not in reality. Their protection was of a Potemkin Village nature: not actually there, but merely a facade that gave them false comfort. \\nThey paid dearly for their arrogance and ignorance. \\nHistory may not repeat, but it does rhyme. The calendar really does seem to say 1788, so 1789â\\x80\\x94and 1792â\\x80\\x93are not as far off as some would like to believe. \\nThis is not a call to arms, but it is a call to reality. Ignore it at your own peril. \\nSome may see these words as a threat. They are not. They are, however, a warning, and a warning from someone who is a student of history. \\nEvery society eventually reaches a breaking point. Ours is nearly there. Some of those who might feel threatened, the so-called elite and insiders, think that they can buy protection as easily as they can buy a Gulfstream. How naÃ¯ve! Who are the private security contractors? Who are the various SOGs? Like law enforcement and the rest of the military, they are the Deplorables. The Deplorables will take your money, but you will not take their lives. Better said, they wonâ\\x80\\x99t give up their lives for you or your family. The security you believe you have purchased is an illusion. Make that delusion. Best to get that out front here and now. \\nSome might think this is all Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s fault. Again, that shows a degree of ignorance and naÃ¯vetÃ© which characterizes the elite. Trump is a symptom, not a cause. He might even be a salve, as the changes he could bring might defuse some of the current anger. \\nOn the other hand, Hillary is a lit match in a room of dynamite. She, like many of the self-important, thinks her very existence is a favor to the rest of us. She epitomizes the absolute worst of what America has become. Above the law, wealthy not through accomplishment, but through influence peddling only, and a bull in a china shop in terms of her effect on both the country and the worldâ\\x80\\x94and I apologize to bulls for that analogy. The world is more unstable because of her. \\nAmerica is less safe because of her. Russia and the USâ\\x80\\x94the two largest nuclear powersâ\\x80\\x94are more at odds because of her. With her in power, we will reach the breaking point at home and internationally, perhaps leading to â\\x80\\x98accidentalâ\\x80\\x99 nuclear war, as the heightened rhetoric impacts clear thinking. Society is more stratified because of her. Race relations have deteriorated because of her (and Obama). \\nThere are few current ills in society and in geopolitics that cannot be laid at her feet, at least to some extent. The Great Deceiver to many, who exhibits an astonishing aversion to truth telling, is enough to make even an agnostic wonder if the anti-Christ hasnâ\\x80\\x99t finally arrived for its three and a half years of rule. \\nA recently hacked email of John Podesta finds him saying â\\x80\\x98she (Hillary) has begun to hate everyday Americansâ\\x80\\x99. No doubt the same feelings were voiced by [Romania dictator] Nicolas Ceaucescu. It turned out the feeling was mutual. [â\\x80¦] \\nElect Hillary, and continue with business as usual, and it is likely this warning will become an epitaph for the America we know. Society may collapse regardless, because the rot is already very great, but she will hasten the day of reckoning. [â\\x80¦]â\\x80\\x9d \\nSee also:',\n",

       " ' (This Nov. 24 story has been refiled to correct paragraph eight to say former CEO was not among the five people prosecuted.) HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has prosecuted five former officials of the unlisted Dong A Bank for violating rules that  lead to serious consequences , police said on Friday, part of a widening investigation involving the Ho Chi Minh City-based lender. Energy and banking firms are at the heart of a sweeping crackdown on corruption in the communist state, a campaign that made global headlines this year when Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping a Vietnamese businessman in Berlin. The troubled, partly private Dong A Bank is among several lenders under scrutiny of the authorities who say they want to tackle corruption, including abuse of power and violation of lending rules.  The Investigation Police Department of the Ministry of Public Security is urgently investigating the case,  police said in a statement.  Abuse of trust to appropriate assets, deliberate violation of state regulations on economic management that led to serious consequences and the violation of lending provisions ... occurred at Dong A Commercial Joint Stock Bank (DAB),  police  said. The five former officials were banned from leaving their homes, police said. Dong A Bank said it would respond to a Reuters request for comment later in the day. The bank s former chief executive officer Tran Phuong Binh was arrested in 2016 along with four other executives. The central bank, the State Bank of Vietnam, had placed Dong A Bank under special supervision in 2015  for violations in financial management and credit grants  by some executives. The ministry of public security said in a statement on Friday that 17 people have been arrested in the Dong A Bank fraud case.  ',\n",
       " 'BOSASO, Somalia (Reuters) - An army colonel in the semi-autonomous Puntland region who also headed the region s bomb disposal unit was killed on Tuesday after a roadside bomb he was defusing exploded, a military official said. The incident occurred on a road that links Bosaso, Puntland s second biggest city, with Galgala Hills which is controlled by al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group. Colonel Osman Abshir Omar was killed after he started dismantling the bomb on Tuesday, one of his colleagues said.  We were with the Colonel. He stopped the car, got down and started dismantling a bomb but it suddenly went off and killed him on the spot,  Major Abdirizak Mohamed, who was among thesoldiers accompanying Omar, told Reuters. Al Shabaab claimed responsibility.  We targeted the Colonel. We exploded the bomb,  Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab s spokesman for military operations, said. Militant attacks in Puntland are rare compared to the rest of Somalia mainly because its security forces are relatively regularly paid and receive substantial U.S. assistance. Al Shabaab, which aims to topple Somalia s government and impose its strict version of Islam on the Horn of Africa state, has become more active in Puntland after being pushed out of its stronghold further south by African Union peacekeepers and the Somali army, officials say. This year there has been rise in violence in Puntland by a  splinter group linked to Islamic State have attacked government troops. ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON(Reuters) - In his first major speech to Congress on Tuesday, President Donald Trump assured U.S. allies that he is committed to NATO, but some of his fellow Republicans have been blocking a Senate vote to expand the alliance for months. The delay of the Senateâ\\x80\\x99s consideration of Montenegroâ\\x80\\x99s accession to the alliance has fueled questions about whether Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s administration and his party will stand up to Russia despite the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s desire for better relations. Moscow opposes any further expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Montenegro, a former Yugoslav republic with a population of 650,000, hopes to win the approval of all 28 NATO allies in time to become a full member at a summit in May. By late February, it had been approved by 24. Members see Montenegroâ\\x80\\x99s accession as a way to counter Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s efforts to expand its influence in the Balkans. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has twice voted in favor of Montenegro, first in December and again in January. But objections by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee have blocked a vote in the full Senate. At a September hearing, Paul questioned the wisdom of angering Russia by allowing a tiny country that could not play a significant role in defending the United States to join the trans-Atlantic alliance. â\\x80\\x9cI think we need to think this through, and we need to have a little bit more of a debate,â\\x80\\x9d he said then. On Wednesday, Paul said he still objected. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not so sure what they add to our defense. So Iâ\\x80\\x99m not so sure itâ\\x80\\x99s a great idea that somehow Montenegroâ\\x80\\x99s going to defend the United States,â\\x80\\x9d Paul told Reuters. A spokesman for Lee said the senator objected only to the Senate considering the matter with a quick voice vote, saying he wanted a roll call so every memberâ\\x80\\x99s position would be recorded. Lee has not made his opinion on Montenegroâ\\x80\\x99s accession public, the spokesman said. Asked if a roll call vote would be scheduled, a spokesman for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he had no updates to provide. If there is a Senate vote, Montenegroâ\\x80\\x99s accession is expected to receive the two-thirds majority needed to pass. Montenegrin Foreign Minister Srdjan Darmanovic told Reuters last month that he had been assured that the Senate would ratify his countryâ\\x80\\x99s accession by May.     Trump has called for closer ties to Moscow and criticized NATO as obsolete. In his speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, he reaffirmed support for the alliance, but said he expects U.S. allies to pay more of the cost of their own security needs. Montenegrin officials blame Moscow for an extended campaign intended to prevent the country from joining NATO. Last month, they said they had evidence Russia was involved in a plot to overthrow its government during an election last October, an accusation Moscow dismissed. The charges echoed assertions by U.S. intelligence that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump could still keep Montenegro from joining by refusing to formally deposit the countryâ\\x80\\x99s Protocol of Accession. Doing so would signal a significant rift with his own party in Congress.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch wrote in an opinion piece published on Thursday that his meeting with Merrick Garland failed to change his view that the Senate should not act on President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s U.S. Supreme Court nominee. The problem is that no such meeting had yet taken place. Later in the day, the Utah senator issued a statement announcing that he would meet with Garland on Thursday, calling the appeals court judge â\\x80\\x9can honorable public servant who deserves our respectâ\\x80\\x9d but reiterating that the Senate should not act now. Paul Edwards, executive editor of the Deseret News in Hatchâ\\x80\\x99s home state of Utah, said by email the article was a draft that was mistakenly published on newspaperâ\\x80\\x99s website, and apologized to Hatch and the newspaperâ\\x80\\x99s readers for â\\x80\\x9cthis unfortunate error.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cLike many of my Senate colleagues, I recently met with Chief Judge Merrick Garland,â\\x80\\x9d Hatch wrote in the piece. â\\x80\\x9cOur meeting, however, does not change my conviction that the Senate should consider a Supreme Court nominee after this presidential election cycle,â\\x80\\x9d Hatch added. The 82-year-old Hatch, first elected to the Senate in 1976, is the longest-serving Senate Republican and is a long-time and influential member of the Judiciary Committee that considers Supreme Court nominees. Hatch has joined with the Senateâ\\x80\\x99s Republican leaders in asserting that Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s successor, to be determined in the Nov. 8 presidential election, should fill the vacancy left by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February. Democrats have accused Senate Republicans of ignoring their constitutional duties by refusing to consider Garlandâ\\x80\\x99s nomination. A copy of the article was archived by Google after the Deseret News removed it. â\\x80\\x9cThe electronic publication of this version, awaiting edits from the Senator following his meeting with Judge Garland, was inadvertent,â\\x80\\x9d Edwards added. The article illustrated how unshakeable Republican opposition has been to Obama, a Democrat, appointing a replacement for Scalia. If a Democratic president appoints Scaliaâ\\x80\\x99s replacement, that would likely end decades of a conservative majority on the court. Obama nominated Garland on March 16. Hatch helped break a partisan log jam in the Senate against Garland two decades ago when President Bill Clinton nominated him to an appeals court. Garland won Senate confirmation in 1997. ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The District of Columbiaâ\\x80\\x99s city council approved a $15-an-hour minimum wage on Tuesday, a rate adopted by a growing number of U.S. cities and states seeking to battle income inequality. The council voted unanimously to pass the measure boosting the minimum hourly wage to $15 by 2020, with subsequent hikes tied to inflation. A final vote will come later this month, and Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has backed the bill. Once approved, the U.S. capital will join California and New York in making $15 the hourly minimum. At least eight cities, including Seattle, have also approved the $15 base. â\\x80\\x9cRaising the minimum wage will help address the issues of  residents being pushed out of the District due to rising costs of living and income inequality,â\\x80\\x9d Council member Vincent Orange, a sponsor of the bill, said in the hearing. He and other supporters say Washingtonâ\\x80\\x99s robust economy and growing population mean it can support a higher minimum wage.  The District of Columbiaâ\\x80\\x99s base wage is $10.50, and will go up by $1 on July 1 under existing law. The federal minimum is $7.25 an hour. The $15 minimum is estimated to raise wages for 114,000 workers, or about 14 percent of the District of Columbiaâ\\x80\\x99s workforce, according to an analysis for the council by the non-profit Economic Policy Institute. The higher pay proposal was supported by unions but was opposed by the Districtâ\\x80\\x99s Chamber of Commerce. It said the District should not raise wages until neighboring suburbs do. The District of Columbiaâ\\x80\\x99s booming restaurant industry also opposed it. Restaurant owners and the local restaurant association said that higher costs would lead to layoffs. Some lawmakers said the measure did not go far enough to address a widening income gap and 18 percent poverty rate. Council member David Grosso added an amendment requiring the government to study a minimum income system to help the poorest residents. â\\x80\\x9cRaising the minimum wage is a good thing, but is $15 enough? Or should the number be $35, or $50 an hour?â\\x80\\x9d he asked. Under the measure, the minimum for workers who get tips, like waiters and bartenders, would also be $15 an hour by 2020. Following talks with unions, restaurateurs and community activists, employers would have to make up the difference between a base for tipped workers that will be $5 an hour in 2020, up from the current $2.77, Orange said.

       " 'Candidate Trump gave a great speech that was about reclaiming OUR government. We feel it s perfect for today   Independence Day!  This is not simply another 4-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not We The People reclaim control over our government.    DJTTRANSCRIPT: Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American People. There is nothing the political establishment will not do, and no lie they will not tell, to hold on to their prestige and power at your expense.The Washington establishment, and the financial and media corporations that fund it, exists for only one reason: to protect and enrich itself.The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. As an example, just one single trade deal they d like to pass, involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries, corporations and lobbyists.For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests they partner with, our campaign represents an existential threat.This is not simply another 4-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not We The People reclaim control over our government.The political establishment that is trying everything to stop us, is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled this country dry. The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs, as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries throughout the world. Our just-announced jobs numbers are anemic, and our gross domestic product, or GDP, is barely above one percent. Workers in the United States, were making less than they were almost 20 years ago   and yet they are working harder.It s a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.Just look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit and Flint, Michigan   and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and across our country. They have stripped these towns bare, and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs.The Clinton Machine is at the center of this power structure. We ve seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.And, likewise, the emails show that the Clinton Machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates. Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times. And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton Campaign on helping her win the election.With their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton Machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign, which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before   and we won t let them do that.The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media. Let s be clear on one thing: the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They are a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with an agenda. And their agenda is to elect the Clintons at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.press we can actualFor them, it is a war   and for them, nothing is out of bounds.This is a struggle for the survival of our nation. This election will determine whether we are a free nation, or whether we have only the illusion of Democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system.This is not just conspiracy but reality, and you and I know it.The establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe and morally deformed. They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and reputation. And they will lie, lie and lie even more.The Clintons are criminals. This is well-documented, and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power. Never in history have we seen such a cover-up as this, one that includes the destruction of 33,000 emails, 13 phones, laptops, missing boxes of evidence, and on and on.People who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything.But I take all of these slings and arrows for you. I take them for our movement, so that we can have our country back. Our great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning.We ve seen it in the United Kingdom, where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty.But the central base of world political power is here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people.Their financial resources are unlimited. Their political resources are unlimited. Their media resources are unlimited. And, most importantly, the depths of their immorality is unlimited.Our political establishment has no soul. I knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.The only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you. The only force strong enough to save this country is you. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American People.They control the Department of Justice, and they even clandestinely meet with the Attorney General of the United States   in the back of her airplane, while on the runway   for 39 minutes   to most likely discuss her reappointment in a Clinton Administration just prior to the Attorney General making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton.Likewise, they have corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed to what he s done to one of our great institutions. Hillary Clinton is guilty of all of the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings, and far more   and yet he let her off the hook, while others lives are being destroyed for far less.This is a conspiracy against you, the American people.This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization.I didn t need to do this. I built a great company, and I had a wonderful life. I could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family, instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions and malicious attacks. I m doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel strongly it was my turn to give back.Some people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell. But they are wrong, it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people.In my former life, I was an insider as much as anybody else   and I know what s like to be an insider. Now I am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam. Because I used to be part of the club, I m the only one who can fix it. I m doing this for the people, and this movement is just right   and we will take back this country for you and Make America Great Again.The corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise. They know, that if we win, their power is gone and returned to you. The clouds hanging over our government can be lifted, and replaced with a bright future   but it all depends on whether we let the New York Times decide our future, or whether we let the American people decide our future.If this Clinton Campaign of Destruction is allowed to work, then no other highly successful person   which is what our country needs   will ever again run for this office.I will not lie to you. These false attacks hurt. To be lied about, to be slandered, to be smeared so publicly and before your family, is painful.What the Clinton Machine is doing to me, and my family, is egregious beyond words. It is reprehensible beyond description.But I also know, it s not about me   it s about all of you. It s about all of us, together, as a country.It s about the Veterans who need medical care, the mothers who ve lost children to terrorism and crime, it s about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help, it s about the millions of jobless Americans. This election is about the people being crushed by Obamacare, and it s about defeating ISIS and appointing Supreme Court Justices who will defend our Constitution.This election is also about the African-American and Hispanic communities whose communities have been plunged into crime, poverty and failing schools by the policies of Hillary Clinton. They ve robbed these citizens of their future, and I will give them their hope, jobs and opportunities back. I will deliver.This election is about every man, woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety, prosperity and peace.We will rise above the lies, the smears, and the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous reporters.We will vote for the country we want.We will vote for the future we want.We will vote for the politics we want.We will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business. We will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers, our borders, our freedoms, and our sovereign rights as a nation. We will end the politics of profit, we will end the rule of special interests, we will put a stop to the raiding of our country   and the disenfranchisement of our people.Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives, finally, on November 8th. Join me in taking back our country, and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people.',\n",
       " ' It Was the Rise of the Davos Class That Sealed AmericaÂ\\x92s Fate\\nHillary ClintonÂ\\x92s embrace of neoliberalism was disastrous. The only answer now is to take on the billionaires\\nBy Naomi Klein\\nNovember 10, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" The Guardian \" - They will blame James Comey and the FBI. They will blame voter suppression and racism. They will blame Bernie or bust and misogyny. They will blame third parties and independent candidates. They will blame the corporate media for giving him the platform, social media for being a bullhorn, and WikiLeaks for airing the laundry.\\nBut this leaves out the force most responsible for creating the nightmare in which we now find ourselves wide awake: neoliberalism. That worldview Â\\x96 fully embodied by Hillary Clinton and her machine Â\\x96 is no match for Trump-style extremism. The decision to run one against the other is what sealed our fate. If we learn nothing else, can we please learn from that mistake?\\nHere is what we need to understand: a hell of a lot of people are in pain. Under neoliberal policies of deregulation, privatisation, austerity and corporate trade, their living standards have declined precipitously. They have lost jobs. They have lost pensions. They have lost much of the safety net that used to make these losses less frightening. They see a future for their kids even worse than their precarious present.\\nAt the same time, they have witnessed the rise of the Davos class, a hyper-connected network of banking and tech billionaires, elected leaders who are awfully cosy with those interests, and Hollywood celebrities who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous. Success is a party to which they were not invited, and they know in their hearts that this rising wealth and power is somehow directly connected to their growing debts and powerlessness.\\nFor the people who saw security and status as their birthright Â\\x96 and that means white men most of all Â\\x96 these losses are unbearable.\\nDonald Trump speaks directly to that pain. The Brexit campaign spoke to that pain. So do all of the rising far-right parties in Europe. They answer it with nostalgic nationalism and anger at remote economic bureaucracies Â\\x96 whether Washington, the North American free trade agreement the World Trade Organisation or the EU. And of course, they answer it by bashing immigrants and people of colour, vilifying Muslims, and degrading women. Elite neoliberalism has nothing to offer that pain, because neoliberalism unleashed the Davos class. People such as Hillary and Bill Clinton are the toast of the Davos party. In truth, they threw the party.\\nTrumpÂ\\x92s message was: Â\\x93All is hell.Â\\x94 Clinton answered: Â\\x93All is well.Â\\x94 But itÂ\\x92s not well Â\\x96 far from it.\\nNeo-fascist responses to rampant insecurity and inequality are not going to go away. But what we know from the 1930s is that what it takes to do battle with fascism is a real left. A good chunk of TrumpÂ\\x92s support could be peeled away if there were a genuine redistributive agenda on the table. An agenda to take on the billionaire class with more than rhetoric, and use the money for a green new deal. Such a plan could create a tidal wave of well-paying unionised jobs, bring badly needed resources and opportunities to communities of colour, and insist that polluters should pay for workers to be retrained and fully included in this future. It could fashion policies that fight institutionalised racism, economic inequality and climate change at the same time. It could take on bad trade deals and police violence, and honour indigenous people as the original protectors of the land, water and air.\\nPeople have a right to be angry, and a powerful, intersectional left agenda can direct that anger where it belongs, while fighting for holistic solutions that will bring a frayed society together.\\nSuch a coalition is possible. In Canada, we have begun to cobble it together under the banner of a peopleÂ\\x92s agenda called The Leap Manifesto , endorsed by more than 220 organisations from Greenpeace Canada to Black Lives Matter Toronto, and some of our largest trade unions.\\nBernie SandersÂ\\x92 amazing campaign went a long way towards building this sort of coalition, and demonstrated that the appetite for democratic socialism is out there. But early on, there was a failure in the campaign to connect with older black and Latino voters who are the demographic most abused by our current economic model. That failure prevented the campaign from reaching its full potential. Those mistakes can be corrected and a bold, transformative coalition is there to be built on.\\nThat is the task ahead. The Democratic party needs to be either decisively wrested from pro-corporate neoliberals, or it needs to be abandoned. From Elizabeth Warren to Nina Turner, to the Occupy alumni who took the Bernie campaign supernova, there is a stronger field of coalition-inspiring progressive leaders out there than at any point in my lifetime. We are Â\\x93leaderfulÂ\\x94, as many in the Movement for Black Lives say.\\nSo letÂ\\x92s get out of shock as fast as we can and build the kind of radical movement that has a genuine answer to the hate and fear represented by the Trumps of this world. LetÂ\\x92s set aside whatever is keeping us apart and start right now.\\nNaomi Klein is the author of This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs the Climate . She tweets @NaomiAKlein',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administrationâ\\x80\\x99s acting director on Tuesday said that he will be leaving his post, two months after he criticized Republican President Donald Trump for telling law enforcement officers not to be â\\x80\\x9ctoo niceâ\\x80\\x9d to suspects. Acting Director Chuck Rosenberg, a holdover from Democratic President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s administration, told the agencyâ\\x80\\x99s staff in an internal email that he will be leaving his position effective Oct. 1. â\\x80\\x9cThis is a remarkable agency - full of remarkable people - and I am honored to have been a small part of it,â\\x80\\x9d Rosenberg said in the message, which was reviewed by Reuters. It was unclear who would replace Rosenberg. The news was first reported by The Washington Post.  A spokesman for the DEA confirmed Rosenbergâ\\x80\\x99s resignation. Rosenberg had been leading the DEA in an acting capacity since 2015. Before joining the agency, he served as chief of staff to former FBI director James Comey, who Trump fired in May.  Rosenberg generated headlines earlier this year after he wrote an agency-wide email in late July challenging comments by Trump suggesting officers do away with practices like protecting the head of a suspect being put into a patrol car. Citing â\\x80\\x9can obligation to speak out when something is wrong,â\\x80\\x9d Rosenberg said Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s remarks, delivered in New York the previous day, â\\x80\\x9ccondoned police misconduct regarding the treatment of individuals placed under arrest by law enforcement.â\\x80\\x9d He leaves the agency at a time when the DEA is grappling with the ongoing opioid drug epidemic, which has become a major law enforcement focus of the U.S. Justice Department. Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. â\\x80\\x9cOpioids such as heroin and fentanyl - and diverted prescription pain pills - are killing people in this country at a horrifying rate,â\\x80\\x9d Rosenberg said in December. â\\x80\\x9cWe face a public health crisis of historic proportions.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",

       " 'YANGON (Reuters) - The two Reuters journalists who were detained in Myanmar on Dec. 12 have appeared in court and been remanded in custody, a police spokesman said on Thursday.  Yes, they were sent to the court,  said police colonel Myo Thu Soe.  The remand has already been obtained. The case is under the Burma State Secrets Act ... so, for now, they are not allowed to meet with anyone and they are being investigated.  Reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have been in detention for nine days with no detail on where they are being held. They have not had access to visitors or lawyers. Pan Ei Mon, Wa Lone s wife, said she was told by police on Thursday that both journalists were well and she was allowed to leave food and clothes for them. The authorities are investigating whether they violated the country s colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. The two journalists had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants. The Ministry of Information said last week that Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, had  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media . A spokesman for Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said on Wednesday that the police had almost completed their investigation, after which a court case would begin and the reporters would have access to a lawyer and be able to meet members of their families. The spokesman said he was told by the Ministry of Home Affairs and police that the two men were being detained in Yangon, Myanmar s largest city, were  in good condition  and had not been subject to  illegal questioning. A number of governments and human rights and journalist groups have criticized Myanmar s authorities for holding the pair incommunicado since their arrest, with no access to a lawyer, colleagues and family members. Myo Thu Soe, the police spokesman, said:  During the investigation by the police force, we are not torturing them nor doing anything that is not in line with human rights.  ',\n",

Or how about the expectant mother whose anxious husband is desperately trying to navigate around a terrorists who are  blocking the road as he tries to get his wife to labor and delivery? And what sort of violence or punishment by law enforcement should these innocent drivers expect if they disobey these thugs and drive through their human roadblock? Why doesn t the news talk about the danger these terrorist are putting everyday Americans in?From Todd Starnes, FOX News   Black Lives Matter protesters laid siege to a number of cities over the weekend including my hometown: Memphis, Tennessee.They shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River   stranding thousands of motorists for hours   in sweltering heat.Blocking a roadway is a crime under Tennessee law.Yet Memphis police officers were told to stand down and allow the agitators to block the Hernando-Desoto Bridge. They used to call that kind of behavior aiding and abetting.Not a single person was arrested.Police say it was a peaceful protest. But photographs taken from the bridge showed a very different situation. In one instance, young men climbed atop a tractor-trailer- raising their fists in defiance.I wonder if the driver of that tractor-trailer thought it was a peaceful demonstration?Television station WMC reported that protesters even blocked a car trying to escort a child to St. Jude Children s Research Hospital. Apparently that child s life did not matter to the protesters.The car was eventually allowed to pass   but only after police intervened.We have no idea how many emergency responses were hampered by the gridlock created by the BLM crowd. We have no idea how many people missed family events or missed work because they were trapped on the interstate.In St. Paul, Minnesota, at least 21 police officers were injured during a  full-scale riot  on Interstate 94, according to the Star-Tribune.Violent thugs hurled rocks, concrete and rebar at officers as they protested the killing of Philando Castile.One of those officers suffered a broken vertebra after someone dropped a concrete block on his head.Could someone explain to me how fracturing a police officer s spine and preventing a child from getting to the hospital advances the Black Lives Matter agenda?The police-involved shootings in Baton Rouge and Minnesota were terrible tragedies.If investigators determine the officers broke they law   they should and must be brought to justice.But both shootings are still under investigation   so to be honest   no one knows for certain what happened.Yet, the mainstream media, the Obama administration and the professional race agitators have once again rushed to judgment   just like they did in Ferguson, Missouri.They never let a crisis go to waste, do they?It feels like our nation has been sucker-punched. You can see it on people s faces. Sorrow. Frustration. Anger. Helplessness.I understand that frustration   but it does not give us a license to disobey the law.Peaceful protesting is one thing. Domestic terrorism is another.Here s a look at what happens when lawbreakers obstruct the roadway. We re uncertain how many of these accidents were intentional or truly accidents.

       " 'TOKYO (Reuters) - Kansai Electric Power Co said on Friday it will decommission two 38-year-old reactors at its Ohi nuclear plant as Japan s electricity industry struggles to cope with new safety standards imposed after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The widely expected announcement brings to 14 the number of reactors being scrapped since the meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. More than six years on, Japan is still turning away from nuclear power in the face of technical problems, public opposition, court challenges and unfavorable economics. Most of Japan s reactors remain shut, with only four operating, while they undergo relicensing processes in a bit to meet new standards set after the Fukushima crisis highlighted shortcomings in regulation. Kansai Electric will now scrap the No. 1 and No. 2 reactors at the Ohi plant, some 86 kilometers (53 miles) from Osaka, western Japan, where the utility is based. Shut since 2011, the reactors have capacity of 1,175 megawatts each, began operations in 1979 and were near the end of their standard operating life of 40 years. A Kansai Electric spokeswoman said that costs in meeting the new safety standards were not a factor behind the decision, but technical difficulties were.  The containment vessels of these reactors are smaller than other reactors in Japan, and a need to beef up the walls to meet the standards would make the work zones even more cramped, making it difficult for prompt repairs in case of troubles,  the spokeswoman said. The move means Japan is likely to soon be eclipsed by China as the third biggest nuclear power sector in the world - by reactor numbers - after the United States and France. Japan now has 42 reactors, including the two to be decommissioned at Ohi, compared with 38 in China, which has nearly 20 more under construction, while the U.S. and France have 99 and 58 respectively, according to the International Energy Agency. Kansai Electric was the most reliant on nuclear energy among Japan s atomic operators, using reactors for nearly half of its electricity generation before the disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, when reactors melted down following a giant earthquake and tsunami. Two other reactors at the Ohi site remain closed. While Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s government is keen to restore a power source that provided about a third of electricity supply before the Fukushima crisis, Japan s public remains deeply skeptical over industry assurances on safety. Anti-nuclear campaigners and residents are increasingly using courts to block restarts and push for plants to close. A Japanese court last week ordered Shikoku Electric Power Co not to restart one of its reactors, overturning a lower court decision in the first instance of a higher court blocking the operation of nuclear plant. Residents have lodged injunctions against most nuclear plants across Japan. ',\n",
       " 'No moment in the 2016 presidential campaign has cried out more for a unifying candidate than the police shootings of two black men last week and the ensuing national uproar, followed by the shocking sniper ambush that killed five police officers in Dallas. And no other moment has revealed more starkly how hard it is for Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton to become that candidate. Never have two presidential nominees been as unpopular as Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, and they are not fully trusted by their own parties nor showing significant crossover appeal in the polls. Mr. Trump, the   champion of law and order, is also the political figure many people blame for sowing division and hatred with his attacks on illegal immigrants, Muslims, Mexicans and others. Rather than defuse tension, he electrifies crowds and vanquishes rivals through provocations that he delights in calling politically incorrect. Of the two, Mrs. Clinton would seem more able, and driven, to try to bring the country together. She has a large following among black voters and speaks ardently about the need for â\\x80\\x9crespectâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9clove and kindness. â\\x80\\x9d After Dallas, she called on â\\x80\\x9cwhite people to understand how   feel every day. â\\x80\\x9d Yet many on the right and some on the left dislike her intensely, and even her admirers say she lacks the public emotion, oratorical skills and reputation for honesty to persuade large numbers of Americans to see things her way. The need for a reassuring and healing voice has come at a particularly bad time for the two presumptive presidential nominees. For many Americans, Mrs. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s credibility was further damaged last week as the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, sharply criticized her for being â\\x80\\x9cextremely carelessâ\\x80\\x9d about her use of private email as secretary of state. At the same time, Mr. Trump alienated many voters with his mixed comments about Saddam Hussein and his defensiveness over a Twitter post that many people regarded as  . â\\x80\\x9cTrump is 100 percent saying the right things about police and respecting authority, but then he says these other comments that are too weird for voters to ignore,â\\x80\\x9d said Fred L. DeLuca, a Trump supporter and former police officer who owns a graphic supply store in Youngstown, Ohio. â\\x80\\x9cAnd Hillary  â\\x80\\x94   I donâ\\x80\\x99t trust what she says about law enforcement, not at all. â\\x80\\x9d Traumatic events have at times become opportunities for presidential candidates to step up and grow in the eyes of the American public, such as when Bill Clinton went to Los Angeles in 1992 in the aftermath of the riots there, or when Barack Obama pushed for aggressive, bipartisan action from the federal government to stem the banking crisis and protect taxpayers. Mr. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s   image and empathic personality appealed across party lines, as did Mr. Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s historic candidacy. And in moments of national crisis, presidents have shown ability to unify the country, if fleetingly, like George W. Bush did after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. These candidates did not have to sell themselves to voters against such an intense combination of terrorism, mass shootings, police and gun violence, social unease and   fear. Still, the current run of crises has, in the view of many Democrats and Republicans, served only to spotlight the shortcomings of both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. â\\x80\\x9cThe sense of alienation and estrangement is so great today that itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to unite people, and these candidates havenâ\\x80\\x99t done it,â\\x80\\x9d said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a Clinton backer. The historian Doris Kearns Goodwin compared the current political climate to the Civil War era and recalled Lincolnâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cHouse Dividedâ\\x80\\x9d speech, during his 1858 Senate campaign, in which he analyzed the deep divisions between the North and the South and predicted that the country would become more united  â\\x80\\x94   but first slavery had to be eliminated or made the law of the land. She said Lincoln proved to be a president who would go to war to unify the country, and credited President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with mobilizing forces around the country and in Congress in the 1960s to pass civil rights legislation that  â\\x80\\x94   while highly divisive  â\\x80\\x94   also brought greater equality for Americans. â\\x80\\x9cIf Trump was a more disciplined, focused candidate, this could be his moment to win over Americans because the desire for a strong leader is great in moments of turbulence,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cBut look at his record. After â\\x80\\x98Brexit,â\\x80\\x99 he talked about the weak currency helping his golf course. After the Orlando shootings, it was, â\\x80\\x98I told you so.â\\x80\\x99 After the F. B. I. report on Hillary, he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t focus on that. Voters want candidates to show we can trust them, and both candidates have this problem. â\\x80\\x9d In several recent polls, roughly   of Americans said that Mrs. Clinton was not honest and trustworthy Mr. Trump drew similar numbers on the question. These polls were conducted before the F. B. I. director rebuked Mrs. Clinton over her private email and handling of classified material. Mr. Trump, whose poll ratings grew after his forceful responses to terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. tried to sound similarly resolute on Friday evening, saying in a video that law enforcement was â\\x80\\x9cthe force between civilization and total chaos. â\\x80\\x9d And, he said, â\\x80\\x9cNow is the time for prayers, love, unity and leadership. â\\x80\\x9d These remarks were relatively restrained for him, and his advisers hope that he can build on his image as a powerful,   executive and attempt to unify voters. He is the choice of most voters who say they are particularly interested in electing a strong leader  â\\x80\\x94   a little over   of the electorate, according to a recent Bloomberg Politics survey. A Gallup poll conducted in May showed that six in 10 Americans consider him a strong and decisive leader. Vernita Blocker, a retired social work administrator from Lindenwold, N. J. supports Mrs. Clinton but said she worried that Mr. Trump might be better suited to capitalize on Americansâ\\x80\\x99 concerns about fraying social order. â\\x80\\x9cThe more people are afraid, the more it plays into Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s hands because they will want a   president,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Blocker said. â\\x80\\x9cHillary has to find more ways to persuade people that she could really unite the country despite all the people who donâ\\x80\\x99t like her. â\\x80\\x9d Yet Mr. Trump is still having trouble uniting his own party, while Mrs. Clinton appears further along with Democrats. The conventions this month will be huge opportunities for the nominees to galvanize the faithful, but also a chance to reach out to the other side with traditionally positive speeches about their hopes for the country. On policy, Mrs. Clinton is also eager to find common ground on gun control and criminal justice reform  â\\x80\\x94   issues that resonate with many voters at a time of seemingly endless violence. While new gun laws are opposed by many on the right, she wants Americans to at least talk about finding solutions  â\\x80\\x94   if not uniting behind them. â\\x80\\x9cI think â\\x80\\x98unityâ\\x80\\x99 is the wrong goal, and what we need canâ\\x80\\x99t be achieved by lofty oratory alone,â\\x80\\x9d said Wendy L. Wall, an associate professor of history at Binghamton University. â\\x80\\x9cOften in our past, unity has meant burying disagreements rather than solving common problems. What we need now is someone who can work across differences, not erase them. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI think there is no way Trump could do this,â\\x80\\x9d she added. â\\x80\\x9cI think the jury is still out on Clinton. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'Peter Certo Other WordsEven in an election year as shot through with conspiracy theories as this one, it would have been hard to imagine a bigger bombshell than Russia intervening to help Donald Trump. But that s exactly what the CIA believes happened, or so unnamed  officials brief on the matter  told the Washington Post.While Russia had long been blamed for hacking email accounts linked to the Clinton campaign, its motives had been shrouded in mystery. According to the Post, though, CIA officials recently presented Congress with a  a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources  that  electing Trump was Russia s goal. Now, the CIA hasn t made any of its evidence public, and the CIA and FBI are reportedly divided on the subject. Though it s too soon to draw conclusions, the charges warrant a serious public investigation.Even some Republicans who backed Trump seem to agree.  The Russians are not our friends,  said Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, announcing his support for a congressional probe. It s  warfare,  added Senator John McCain.There s a grim irony to this. The CIA is accusing Russia of interfering in our free and fair elections to install a right-wing candidate it deemed more favorable to its interests. Yet during the Cold War, that s exactly what the CIA did to the rest of the world.Most Americans probably don t know that history. But in much of the world it s a crucial part of how Washington is viewed even today.In the post-World War II years, as Moscow and Washington jockeyed for global influence, the two capitals tried to game every foreign election they could get their hands on.From Europe to Vietnam and Chile to the Philippines, American agents delivered briefcases of cash to hand-picked politicians, launched smear campaigns against their left-leaning rivals, and spread hysterical  fake news  stories like the ones some now accuse Russia of spreading here.Together, political scientist Dov Levin estimates, Russia and the U.S. interfered in 117 elections this way in the second half the 20th century. Even worse is what happened when the CIA s chosen candidates lost.In Iran, when elected leader Mohammad Mossadegh tried to nationalize the country s BP-held oil reserves, CIA agent Kermit Roosevelt led an operation to oust Mossadegh in favor of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The shah s secret police tortured dissidents by the thousands, leading directly to the Islamic Revolution in 1979.In Guatemala, when the democratically elected Jacobo Arbez tried to loosen the U.S.-based United Fruit company s grip on Guatemalan land, the CIA backed a coup against him. In the decades of civil war that followed, U.S.-backed security forces were accused of carrying out a genocide against indigenous Guatemalans. Chile s democratically elected leader Allende was murdered in a brutal CIA coup d etat on September 11, 1973 (Image Source: Evergreen.edu)In Chile, after voters elected the socialist Salvador Allende, the CIA spearheaded a bloody coup to install the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, who went on to torture and disappear tens of thousands of Chileans.

       " 'SEOUL (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will wrap up his visit to Seoul on Wednesday with a major speech on North Korea and then shift focus to China, where he is expected to press a reluctant President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang,  U.S. officials say. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s address to South Koreaâ\\x80\\x99s National Assembly will come a day after he seemed to take a more balanced approach: threatening to use Americaâ\\x80\\x99s full military might against North Korea if needed, but also offering it a diplomatic opening to â\\x80\\x9cmake a dealâ\\x80\\x9d to end the nuclear standoff. While Trump presented no specific solution to his toughest global security challenge, his more conciliatory rhetoric toward North Korea could help lower tensions between Washington and Pyongyang that have put much of the east Asian region on edge over the prospects for military conflict. It contrasted markedly with Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s earlier threats to â\\x80\\x9ctotally destroyâ\\x80\\x9d North Korea if it threatened the United States, and the personal insults he exchanged with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. It remains to be seen, however, whether the unpredictable Trump, in his final day on North Koreaâ\\x80\\x99s doorstep, will build  on this approach or return to the bellicose language that has characterized his handling of the North Korean issue. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s official â\\x80\\x9ctalking pointsâ\\x80\\x9d for his Asia tour show that he intends to use the speech in part to contrast South Koreaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9camazing riseâ\\x80\\x9d with North Koreaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9csad, backward  stateâ\\x80\\x9d and to urge resolve against Pyongyang, according to a confidential document reviewed by Reuters. He is also expected to condemn Pyongyang for its poor human rights record. Trump will then fly to Beijing where, according to senior administration officials, he will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports, coal imports and financial transactions. Previewing his Beijing visit, Trump told a news conference in Seoul on Tuesday that China and North Koreaâ\\x80\\x99s other giant neighbor, Russia, were among countries whose cooperation will be  crucial in getting North Korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs. â\\x80\\x9cPresident Xi â\\x80¦ has been very helpful. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll find out how helpful soon,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. But it is far from clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more. China says its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West, and points to its support in the U.N. Security Council for recent sanctions on North Korea as evidence that it is doing all it can to curtail the isolated nationâ\\x80\\x99s nuclear and missile tests. â\\x80\\x9cOn this issue, Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s position and stance is already very clear and staunch,â\\x80\\x9d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday. â\\x80\\x9cEveryone can see clearly that we donâ\\x80\\x99t need anybody to tell us what we should be doing.â\\x80\\x9d But with Trump appearing to crack open the  door to diplomacy with North Korea â\\x80\\x93 something that China has long urged â\\x80\\x93 he may have a better chance of securing further promises to intensify economic pressure on North Korea, which relies on Beijing for more than 90 percent of its trade. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, however, has seemed willing to risk snubbing China when he deems it useful as he pursues development of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. At the same time, Xi may be mindful that Trump has held off on trade actions against China that he loudly threatened during the 2016 presidential campaign to give Beijing more time to make progress on North Korea. For his part, Xi will also be looking to maintain the good personal chemistry the two leaders developed when Trump hosted him at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in April. The â\\x80\\x9cbromanceâ\\x80\\x9d is set to continue when Xi returns the favor by laying on a lavish welcome for Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s visit starting on Wednesday. Trump is expected to go to the Forbidden City, possibly guided by Xi, and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details. ',\n",
       " 'Donald J. Trump on Sunday renewed his call for the United States to consider profiling as a preventive tactic against terrorism in the aftermath of the mass shooting last week in Orlando, Fla. â\\x80\\x9cI hate the concept of profiling, but we have to start using common sense,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in an interview on CBSâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cFace the Nation. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump issued a similar call in December after the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. which left 14 people dead and more than 20 injured. On Sunday, he also sought to downplay any differences between his positions on gun control and those of the National Rifle Association. Last week, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that people on the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s terrorist watch list should be barred from buying firearms, a stance that contradicts that of the N. R. A. But Mr. Trump seems to be backtracking, saying on ABCâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cThis Weekâ\\x80\\x9d that he â\\x80\\x9cunderstands exactlyâ\\x80\\x9d the N. R. A. â\\x80\\x99s objections to restricting access to people on the watch list. â\\x80\\x9cA lot of people are on the list that really maybe shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be on the list, and their rights are being taken away,â\\x80\\x9d he said. The N. R. A. used the Sunday morning political shows to criticize, and even to mock, Democratic efforts to pass new gun control laws after the Orlando shooting. Wayne LaPierre, the groupâ\\x80\\x99s executive vice president, said on â\\x80\\x9cFace the Nationâ\\x80\\x9d that legislation was effectively useless at preventing terrorist attacks. â\\x80\\x9cThese bad guys weâ\\x80\\x99re facing, they donâ\\x80\\x99t say: â\\x80\\x98Oh gosh, they passed a law. Oh gosh, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I could do it,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Mr. LaPierre said. Democrats made their own push for expanded gun control  â\\x80\\x94   which the Senate is to take up Monday  â\\x80\\x94   and more broadly, for a   effort to take on opponents of stricter gun control. Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who led a   marathon of speeches on the Senate floor that ended early Thursday, said on ABC that â\\x80\\x9cthe only way that you win this issue is by building a political infrastructure around the country that rivals that of the gun lobby. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s presumptive Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, expressed her support for the effort, writing â\\x80\\x9cStand strong @ChrisMurphyCTâ\\x80\\x9d on Twitter. Profiling has been an occasional theme of the Trump campaign. In addition to his most recent comments, Mr. Trump has discussed increased surveillance of Muslims and mosques, and has said that he would consider registering Muslims in a special database or requiring that they carry cards that identify them as Muslim.',\n",

Unfortunately for her, what happened just seconds later was all caught on tape â\\x80\\x93 and she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t hide it. \\nDespite what she would have you believe, Hillary is not as healthy as she claims. As weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen strange eye movements that hint toward Parkinsonâ\\x80\\x99s disease and an ever increasing difficulty to get up or down a flight of stairs , itâ\\x80\\x99s safe to say she wonâ\\x80\\x99t make it 4 years in our White House. Hillary Clinton \\nHowever, her most recent stunt has set a few people on edge as it goes to show that sheâ\\x80\\x99s suffering from more than just physical impairments. According to The American Mirror , the female presidential hopeful suffered an embarrassing moment as her brain seemingly froze mid-sentence. \\nAll caught on video, Hillary was speaking in Lake Worth, Florida on the topic of solar energy when the crowd started to cheer. At that moment, Hillary stopped dead in her tracks and tried to stutter through her thoughts. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re not exactly known as the sunshine states,â\\x80\\x9d Clinton said. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot of great things about those states, but think about the jobs that can be created, as well as contributing to what we need to do together to saveâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d she said before awkwardly pausing and finally adding, â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦our country and the world.â\\x80\\x9d \\nUnfortunately for her, not even she could hide the embarrassing brain freeze as it was all caught on camera. Although some people are saying she may have been distracted, that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to be the case as it has happened before. \\nIn fact, there is also footage of the last ordeal that took place before she gained the nomination. While speaking at a rally where she was attacking Bernie Sanders, a similarly embarrassing series of events played out: \\nMany people have been saying how Hillaryâ\\x80\\x99s brain isnâ\\x80\\x99t quite up to par, but weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing more and more of it as her campaign progresses. She has been in the campaign spotlight for about a year now, and America is starting to catch on to her dirty little secret. \\nIf she canâ\\x80\\x99t handle one year on the campaign trail, how is she going to look in another few years after suffering the abuse that a presidential term comes with? Any responsible person would have dropped out long ago â\\x80\\x93 like maybe, the first time she literally dropped in the streets at the 9/11 memorial event in New York City. \\nIt just goes to show how far this woman is willing to go in her pursuit of power. Letâ\\x80\\x99s just hope that Donald Trump shuts her down in November before she can do our nation any more harm.',\n",
       " 'SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The election of Republican businessman Donald Trump as president of the United States has some Californians dreaming - of their own country. One in every three California residents supports the most populous U.S. stateâ\\x80\\x99s peaceful withdrawal from the union, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, many of them Democrats strongly opposed to Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s ascension to the countryâ\\x80\\x99s highest office.  The 32 percent support rate is sharply higher than the last time the poll asked Californians about secession, in 2014, when one-in-five or 20 percent favored it around the time Scotland held its independence referendum and voted to remain in the United Kingdom.  California also far surpasses the national average favoring secession, which stood at 22 percent, down from 24 percent in 2014.  The poll surveyed 500 Californians among more than 14,000 adults nationwide from Dec. 6 to Jan. 19 and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of one percentage point nationally and five percentage points in California. The idea of secession is largely a settled matter in the United States, though the impulse to break away carries on in some corners of the country, most notably in Texas. While interest has remained about the same nationwide, it has found more favor in California and the concept has even earned a catchy name - â\\x80\\x9cCalexit.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think itâ\\x80\\x99s likely to happen, but if things get really bad it could be an option,â\\x80\\x9d said Stephen Miller, 70, a retired transportation planner who lives in Sacramento and told pollsters he â\\x80\\x9ctended to supportâ\\x80\\x9d secession. During the campaign, Trump alienated many in the Democratic-leaning state with his promises to crack down on illegal immigration, threats of creating a Muslim registry, remarks women found offensive and vows to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s such hostility towards Trump that many citizens believe it would be smarter to leave than fight,â\\x80\\x9d said Democratic political consultant Steve Maviglio, who last year ran the campaign against a proposed ballot initiative to break California into six states. ANTI-TRUMP PROTESTS With 39 million residents and the sixth-largest economy in the world, California is already a nation-state, Maviglio said. In Novemberâ\\x80\\x99s election, the state broke nearly two-to-one in favor of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. In practice, secession is highly unlikely, facing political, legal and possibly even military obstacles, considering that the United States fought the Civil War over the secession of the South, Maviglio and others said.    Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s election gave a huge boost to the quixotic campaign to remove California from the United States called Yes California, run by a former conservative turned progressive who now lives in Russia. Dubbed â\\x80\\x9cCalexitâ\\x80\\x9d by pundits comparing the effort to â\\x80\\x9cBrexitâ\\x80\\x9d - Britainâ\\x80\\x99s vote to withdraw from the European Union - Yes Californiaâ\\x80\\x99s email list jumped from fewer than 2,500 before the election to 115,069 currently, the groupâ\\x80\\x99s president, Louis Marinelli, said in a telephone interview. Marinelli, who moved to Yekaterinburg, about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) east of Moscow, in September and has lived in Russia on and off for several years, said he became disenchanted with the United States after difficulties arose with the immigration process for his Russian-born wife. On Friday, activists from the group waved signs saying â\\x80\\x9cCalifornia out of the United Statesâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cU.S. out of Californiaâ\\x80\\x9d at anti-Trump protests in Los Angeles and San Francisco, Marinelli said. They have requested approval from the state to begin collecting signatures for a pro-secession ballot initiative. In Lodi, California, Democratic party activist Bruce Rubly, who told Reuters/Ipsos pollsters that he â\\x80\\x9cstrongly supportedâ\\x80\\x9d California secession, said he thinks it could happen if Trump and the Republicans who dominate the U.S. Congress impose conservative policies on such issues as the environment, immigration and marijuana legalization. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a whole series of things that are going to get Californians riled up,â\\x80\\x9d said Rubly, 68. â\\x80\\x9cAnd if he pushes those buttons in the wrong way, thereâ\\x80\\x99s going to be hell to pay.â\\x80\\x9d  ',\n",

But according to a Daily Beast analysis of annual IRS reports and New York state financial disclosures from the charityâ\\x80\\x99s inception in 2007 to 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, ETF spent $881,779 on its annual Golf Invitational at Trump-owned clubs, a portion of whichâ\\x80\\x94$100,000 in 2013 and $88,000 in 2014â\\x80\\x94was reported as paid directly â\\x80\\x9cto a company of a family member of the Board of Directors.â\\x80\\x9d In other words, Donald Trump himself.\\n\\nDonald Trump, and his private foundation, are already in hot water as reports swirl of suspected self-dealing, or using his foundation funds for private gain. Indeed, the man who considers a presidential run as an opportunity to turn a profit made headlines and invited criticism this week, after The Washington Post revealed that the self-professed billionaire had reportedly used monies from the Donald J. Trump Foundation to pay off $258,000 in legal disputes. Previous reports found Donald Trump had also used the fundâ\\x80\\x94which he hasnâ\\x80\\x99t personally donated to since 2008â\\x80\\x94to purchase portraits of himself, and gift $25,000 to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in a possible quid pro quo to head off an investigation into his shady Trump University, both of which may have violated federal and state tax laws. New Yorkâ\\x80\\x99s attorney general is currently investigating the reports.\\n\\nOf course, viewed through the prism of his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s questionable philanthropic practices, Eric Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s foundation seems downright angelic. Eric Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s foundation operates with almost no overhead: Eric neither pays himself nor his board members and relies on Trump Organization employees who volunteer for whatever the foundation may need. Most importantly, Eric Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s charity has, over the last 10 years according to its tax reports, raised $6.5 million for St. Jude Childrenâ\\x80\\x99s Research Hospital, a beloved Tennessee-based nonprofit that treats children with catastrophic diseases free-of-charge. That figure nearly doubles, when you include the year-long fundraisers utilizing Trump hotelsâ\\x80\\x94where guests are encouraged to donate and buy special services, a percentage of which goes to St. Judeâ\\x80\\x94and employees, who both contribute their money and volunteer their time by competing in company-wide contests and organizing events like car washes, bake sales, and walk-a-thons, to raise cash that goes straight to the hospitalâ\\x80\\x94over $600,000 this past year, according to ETFâ\\x80\\x99s executive director, Paige Scardigli.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe pride ourselves on having an extremely low expense ratio and that is only made possible by leveraging off the Trump assets,â\\x80\\x9d Scardigli wrote in an email to The Daily Beast. â\\x80\\x9cTrump assets are not profiting from these ETF events, but instead they are donating their time and resources to the cause.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re so lucky as Trumps to have the best hotels in the world, to have the best golf courses in the world, and other great assets, and weâ\\x80\\x99re so lucky to be able to use those assets at our disposal for a great purpose. And thatâ\\x80\\x99s really what ETF is,â\\x80\\x9d Eric says in a 2016 video.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt sounds like they were just making a number up,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth Keating, a Boston University professor who studies nonprofit finance. â\\x80\\x9cThey should have had a proposal that said, â\\x80\\x98These are the costs,â\\x80\\x99 for which there should be an invoice, detailing what the foundation was paying for. Instead it sounds like the golf course just said, 'Give us $100,000.'â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nScardigli took the reins as ETFâ\\x80\\x99s director in January, replacing a woman who left the organization after eight months. And hers wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the only high-level dropout this year. The foundationâ\\x80\\x99s Board of Directors and Executive Committee have each lost a member since March: Jeffrey Lichtenberg, a freelance real-estate broker and consultant with a history of bid rigging on construction projects, and Nathan Crisp, until recently, a Trump Hotels executive who police accused of twice slamming a Brooklyn mother to the ground on Easter.\\n\\nWhen asked why the Trump Organization didnâ\\x80\\x99t donate the use of the courses, Michael Cohen, a longtime attorney to Donald Trump and board member on the Eric Trump foundation, said, â\\x80\\x9cI believe there are certain rules that you do have to pay for certain thingsâ\\x80\\x94theyâ\\x80\\x99re not marked up. Itâ\\x80\\x99s inexpensive. I think thereâ\\x80\\x99s some law that says you have to.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTrump National Golf Club Westchester, where ETFâ\\x80\\x99s annual event is held, did not return a request for event pricing, but charities which have held fundraisers at Trump clubs showed similar expenses and revenue in their tax reports (known as 990s), suggesting Eric Trump indeed paid a standard rateâ\\x80\\x94around $100,000â\\x80\\x94for use of his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s property. Tic Toc Stop, a charity dedicated to funding Tourette Syndrome research, paid $51,700 for a smaller golf outing in 2014. And according to The Boston Globe, the Dana-Farber Cancer Instituteâ\\x80\\x94which has held its annual gala at Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, for the last six yearsâ\\x80\\x94paid around $150,000 for a fundraiser with up to 600 guests. The most recent ETF fundraiser boasted 500 attendees.\\n\\nThough the Eric Trump Foundationâ\\x80\\x99s website says, â\\x80\\x9cWe exclusively support St. Jude Childrenâ\\x80\\x99s Research Hospital,â\\x80\\x9d that isnâ\\x80\\x99t the case. In 2012, ETF began donating in earnest to other causes, cutting small checks to 40 individual charities in addition to the outsize donation given to the childrenâ\\x80\\x99s hospital. Some of these small donationsâ\\x80\\x94like the $1,600 to the American Society for Enology and Viticulture, a California wine industry organization where Eric Trump once gave a keynote addressâ\\x80\\x94have seemingly little to do with the charityâ\\x80\\x99s mission of helping sick children.\\n\\nThe catâ\\x80\\x99s cradle of connections donâ\\x80\\x99t end there. The GSM fund paid out $43,231 that same year for their golf tournamentâ\\x80\\x94an annual event held at Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Hudson Valley course that cost nearly double what the charity gave out in grants that year. They, along with at least six other charities that have received donations from the Eric Trump Foundation since 2012, hold fundraising events at Trump golf clubs.\",\n",

It s been a company that s been unbelievably managed, and to me a great advantage is he knows many of the players and he knows them well.

       " '(7 fans) - Advertisement - Amid mounting anger against the US-client government of Field Marshal Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi because of tax rises, soaring food prices, inflation and cuts in state subsidies, a kangaroo court in Cairo has confirmed a 20-year prison sentence against Mohamed Morsi, the first democratically elected President who was deposed by Al-Sisi in July 2013. \\nIn April 2015, a Cairo court had sentenced Morsi to 20 years in prison for inciting violence against protesters who had staged a sit-in outside the Ittihadiya presidential palace in December 2012, when Morsi was still in power. \\nTwenty-year jail sentences were also confirmed against other senior figures from Morsi\\'s Muslim Brotherhood, including Mohamed el-Beltagy and Essam el-Erian. The men were convicted in April 2015 on charges including kidnapping, torture and the killings of protesters during unrest in 2012. \\nMorsi, elected in 2012 and overthrown in 2013, is facing several trials. After a controversial trial, he was sentenced to death in May 2015 for allegedly participating in violence against the police during the 2011 uprising against former President Hosni Mubarak, but his court appointed lawyers have appealed that verdict. \\nAn Egyptian court cancelled the life sentences on Tuesday (Oct 25) handed out to former president Mohamed Morsi and Muslim Brotherhood chief Mohamed Badie along with 15 other leaders of the banned group in an espionage case and ordered a retrial. \\nThe court also cancelled death sentences handed out to 16 other Muslim Brotherhood members, including top leaders Khyrat el-Sharer and Mohamed el-Beltagy Ahmed Abdel Aty. Thirteen of the 16 were sentenced in absentia. The defendants were accused of spying, funding terrorism and disclosing national security. \\nTurkey\\'s president, Tayyip ErdoÃ\\x84Â\\x9fan, had criticized the death sentence for Morsi and accused the west of hypocrisy. \"The popularly elected president of Egypt, chosen with 52% of the vote, has unfortunately been sentenced to death,\" ErdoÃ\\x84Â\\x9fan said at a rally in Istanbul. \\n\"Egypt is turning back into ancient Egypt,\" he said, referring to the Pharaonic rule of the land that ended more than two millennia ago. \"The west, unfortunately, is still turning a blind eye to Sisi\\'s coup,\" he added. \"While they abolished the death penalty in their own countries, they just look on as spectators at this execution in Egypt.\" - Advertisement - \\nMorsi, who has also been sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted of leaking state secrets to Qatar, has not appointed a lawyer to defend himself and has refused to recognize the legitimacy of the court proceedings, saying he remains Egypt\\'s legitimate president. \\nThe Muslim Brotherhood has been blamed for the unrest in Egypt, which has resulted in the death of hundreds of people. Al-Sisi\\'s government designated the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group in December 2013, making even verbal expressions of support punishable by imprisonment. \\nHundreds of people have been sentenced to death in a crackdown following Morsi\\'s overthrow. Seven have been executed, including six defendants sentenced to death by a military court for allegedly participating in militant attacks. \\nMore than three years after Sisi ousted Morsi, his promise to restore stability is wearing thin. Desperation and anger among Egyptians is mounting due to increase in food prices, while the double-digit inflation rate squeezes poor Egyptians. \\nAccording to the Middle East Monitor, core inflation is at seven-year-highs, near 14 percent, as a foreign exchange shortage and a hike in customs duties bite hard in a country that imports everything from sugar to luxury cars. The government raised electricity prices by 25-40 percent in August and is phasing in a 13 percent value-added tax approved by parliament in the same month. - Advertisement - \\nAs part of reforms aimed at clinching a $12 billion IMF loan needed to plug its gaping budget deficit, the government is also expected to cut petrol subsidies and devalue the Egyptian pound, prompting a further cycle of inflation in Egypt, where tens of millions rely on state-subsidized bread, the Middle East Monitor said adding: \"Dollar rationing at banks has driven businesses toward the black market where the dollar is now selling for more than 15.5 pounds -- a huge mark-up from the official rate of about 8.8. Rumors have spread that Friday Nov. 11 will be a day of protest over economic conditions, the Middle East Monitor reported. Police have already detained about 70 people for inciting protests, accusing many of loyalty to the banned Muslim Brotherhood.',\n",

       " 'A Birmingham, Alabama ABC affiliate sought out voters in Columbiana, AL to gauge their reactions to the Washington Post report that alleged Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Roy Moore engaged in inappropriate conduct with four teenage girls more than 34 years ago.None of the respondents according to Walsh told her they believed the Post s reporting. It s hard to believe the events that transpired yesterday,  Gordon Fluker of nearby Wilsonville, AL said to Walsh about the Washington Post report.Moore continues to lead his Democrat opponent by double digits Voters are not buying the accusers story The latest problem with the story is the mother of the accuser s story. She just made a huge mistake in her recounting of what happened over 34 years ago The character assassination of Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore continues with different RINO Republicans coming out to say Moore should step down as a candidate for US Senate. The problem is that the press and the anti-Moore politicians have crucified Moore We thought you were innocent until proven guilty!Another key fact: The claim is a 40 year old claim brought to light by a woman who has ties to the DNC So many things about this claim just don t pass the smell test. Breitbart News has yet another item that doesn t help the accuser s case:MOTHER MAKES BIG MISTAKE: The mother of Leigh Corfman, who says that Alabama Senatorial Candidate Roy Moore tried to engage in a sexual encounter with her when she was 14, has contradicted a key detail of Corfman s story. Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Corfman s mother, Nancy Wells, 71, says that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that Moore is reported to have allegedly called Corfman   purportedly on Confman s bedroom phone   to arrange at least one encounter.Moore strongly denies Corfman s claims.The Washington Post, which first published its newsmaking, on-the-record interview with Corfman last week, cited Corfman as remembering that she provided Moore with her number when she was 14. She said that she spoke to Moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom.Citing Corfman, the Post reported:After her mother went into the courtroom, Corfman says, Moore asked her where she went to school, what she liked to do and whether he could call her sometime. She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after. She says she talked to Moore on her phone in her bedroom, and they made plans for him to pick her up at Alcott Road and Riley Street, around the corner from her house.Soon after, Corfman said, he called again, and picked her up again at the same spot.Later on, Corfman described a third phone call:She says that after their last encounter, Moore called again, but that she found an excuse to avoid seeing him. She says that at some point during or soon after her meetings with Moore, she told two friends in vague terms that she was seeing an older man.Corfman clearly claimed she spoke to Moore on what she said was  her phone in her bedroom  on at least one of those occasions. The Post did not specify whether the second or third alleged calls purportedly took place on a bedroom phone.Wells, Corfman s mother, was asked by Breitbart News:  Back then did she have her own phone in her room or something? No,  she replied matter-of-factly.  But the phone in the house could get through to her easily. HOW COULD HE BE GUILTY?The Post story relies heavily on Corfman s memory and her ability to recount events consistently.The newspaper reported that  Corfman described her story consistently in six interviews with The Post. The Post story uses the word  remembers  10 times when quoting or paraphrasing Corfman.Here are those 10 times:1: The Post cited Corfman thusly:  I wanted it over with   I wanted out,  she remembers thinking. This detail related to Corfman s claim that Moore drove her to his house, removed his own clothes besides his underwear, took off her shirt and guided her hand to his underwear.2: During the initial alleged encounter, when Corfman said that Moore was watching her while Corfman s mother went into the courtroom, the Post reported,  She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after. 3:  I remember the further I got from my house, the more nervous I got,  Corfman was quoted as saying when she recalled the alleged drive with Moore from her house.5   7: The Post used the word three times when citing Corfman in the following paragraph:She remembers an unpaved driveway. She remembers going inside and him giving her alcohol on this visit or the next, and that at some point she told him she was 14. She says they sat and talked. She remembers that Moore told her she was pretty, put his arm around her and kissed her, and that she began to feel nervous and asked him to take her home, which she says he did.8   Referring to the alleged sexual encounter, the Post reported:She remembers that Moore kissed her, that he took off her pants and shirt, and that he touched her through her bra and underpants. She says that he guided her hand to his underwear and that she yanked her hand back.9   In that same encounter, the Post relates:She remembers thinking,  I don t want to do this  and  I need to get out of here.  She says that she got dressed and asked Moore to take her home, and that he did.Meanwhile, Wells told Breitbart that she and her daughter stick by the Post s story.  It s truthful and it was researched very well,  she said.Asked if she could remember Moore, then a 32-year-old assistant district attorney, allegedly asking to watch her daughter in 1971 while Wells went into a courtroom, Wells recounted the story essentially the same way she told it to the Post.Wells told this reporter:  We were sitting in the hall. He came up and started talking to us. We were sitting on a bench waiting to go into court. He said, you know,  What are you doing.  You know, we told him. He is Roy Moore. And he said,  You don t want her to go in there and hear all of the bickering.  And I said,  No.  He said,  I will be glad to stay out here with her and bring her in if she needs to come in.  And so that is the way it started. Probably if it were in today s times that never would have happened,  Wells added.  He sounded like someone that I could trust and we were there in the courthouse. Corfman described her own troubled background to the Post, including three divorces, bankruptcies and a history of drug abuse.The Post related:She says that her teenage life became increasingly reckless with drinking, drugs, boyfriends, and a suicide attempt when she was 16.As the years went on, Corfman says, she did not share her story about Moore partly because of the trouble in her life. She has had three divorces and financial problems. While living in Arizona, she and her second husband started a screen-printing business that fell into debt. They filed for bankruptcy protection three times, once in 1991 with $139,689 in unpaid claims brought by the Internal Revenue Service and other creditors, according to court records.Moore strongly denied Corfman s claims.  These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign,  Moore said in immediate response to the Post s story.Moore s campaign said in a statement,  This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation. The campaign pointed out that Moore has been married to his wife, Kayla, for nearly 33 years and has four children and five grandchildren. It also noted that Moore has served in public office in the past and that no such allegations were previously made.The statement said:The Judge has been a candidate in four hotly-contested statewide political contests, twice as a gubernatorial candidate and twice as a candidate for chief justice. He has been a three-time candidate for local office, and he has been a national figure in two ground-breaking, judicial fights over religious liberty and traditional marriage. After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they surely would have been made public long before now,  the statement continued.On Saturday, Moore further addressed the allegations: Now I want to address something that some people have come here to hear about,  Moore said at a local campaign event.  Shortly after becoming the Republican nominee for the United States Senate, the Washington Post began an attack on the Foundation for Moral Law, on my wife, and on me. For weeks, we read about my salary which they distorted, about taxes where they said we were paid money we never got. But we endured that. Later, they came out and endorsed my opponent in this race,  he continued.  Just two days ago, the Washington Post published yet another attack on my character and reputation in a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign for the United States Senate. These attacks about a minor are completely false and untrue about something that happened nearly 40 years ago. But more than being completely false and untrue, they are very hurtful to me personally. I wanted to make it clear to the media present and the people present, I have not provided alcoholic beverages beer or anything else to a minor. I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone,  he declared.  These allegations came only four and a half weeks before the general election on Dec. 12. Why now? For forty years I have been closely scrutinized in the press and the public media. I have had investigations by the attorney general, I ve had investigations by the judicial inquiry commission on more than one occasion, I ve had investigations by the court of the judiciary, I ve been in five statewide campaigns in which they do opposition research they do investigations, as you can see in every one I ve ever run and three county elections and two major controversies over religious liberty and the Ten Commandments and same-sex marriage,  he continued.  I ve been investigated more than any other person in this country. That grown women would wait forty years to come right before an election to bring charges is absolutely unbelievable. ',\n",

       " 'Polls taken in 2016 show the American public strongly backs Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s dramatic immigration policy change, which says the United States will revive the traditional practice of excluding migrants hostile to Americansâ\\x80\\x99 civic society and constitutional traditions. [Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the dramatic policy change  â\\x80\\x94   not Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s other curbs on Muslim refugee inflow  â\\x80\\x94   which has caused a dramatic wave of   protests by   Islamic and Latino groups.   Trump is doing what American voters prefer. In June 2015, for example, a poll showed that 56 percent of Americans want to exclude migrants who believe in Islamâ\\x80\\x99s sharia law, which requires that democracy and civic norms by subordinated the Islamic scriptures. In contrast, only about 20 percent of Americans told the pollster that they did not oppose the immigration of people who believe in sharia law. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s support for American culture is the centerpiece of his Friday order on immigration, but the policyâ\\x80\\x99s importance has been overlooked by the   protests.  Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s   declaration is a huge reform because it directly rejects the claim by globalist progressives  â\\x80\\x94   including former President Barack Obama  â\\x80\\x94   that foreign people have the same rights as Americans, including the right to live in the United States, regardless of who Americans prefer to invite into their home. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s the critical passage from Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Friday order:  In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including â\\x80\\x9chonorâ\\x80\\x9d killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. Obama described the prior globalist policy in a Nov. 2014 speech to Democratic supporters in Chicago: Sometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that, sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration.  If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, â\\x80\\x98Well, I donâ\\x80\\x99t want those folksâ\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x94   even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans. Obama made the same   claim in September 2015:  When I hear folks talking as if somehow these [foreign] kids are different than my kids or less worthy in the eyes of God, that somehow that they are less worthy of our respect and consideration and care, I think thatâ\\x80\\x99s  . I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe that, I think it is wrong and I think we should do better, because thatâ\\x80\\x99s how America was made. Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s outside policy is expressed more crudely by the alliance of Islamic and   groups which is now protesting Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s   immigration policy at airports. #SFO: â\\x80\\x9dNo borders, no nations, fuck deportationsâ\\x80\\x9d pic. twitter.   â\\x80\\x94   Dieter Bohn (@backlon) January 29, 2017,  On Sunday evening, a senior administration official briefed reporters on Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s   migration policy. â\\x80\\x9cThe reality, though, is that the situation [of large Islamic populations] that exists today in parts of France, in parts of Germany, in Belgium, etcetera, is not a situation we want replicated inside the United States,â\\x80\\x9d the official said.  The kind of large and permanent domestic terror threat that becomes   and   and becomes sort of a permanent feature, in case this, becomes a permanent feature of American life. We donâ\\x80\\x99t want a situation where, 20 to 30 years from now, itâ\\x80\\x99s just like a given thing that on a fairly regular basis there is domestic terror strikes, stores are shut up or that airports have explosive devices planted, or people are mowed down in the street by cars and automobiles and things of that nature  â\\x80¦     The United States is sovereign country. It is under no obligation to admit any particular person and we have a right to develop a system in which weâ\\x80\\x99re selecting immigrants that we think will be able to make positive contributions to U. S. society. This   policy is a huge threat to many advocacy groups, such as the orthodox Islamist groups now pushing to increase the inflow of Muslims into Americans society, the Latino advocacy groups who want more Latino voters, and the elitist Democratic Party, which expects to win national power by collecting votes from diverse immigrant voters. But Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s huge shift to   immigration policy was welcomed by opponents of political Islam, including Brian Thomas, a writer for the JihadWatch website. The new policy, he wrote:  indicates that they know exactly what theyâ\\x80\\x99re doing. This isnâ\\x80\\x99t something they put together in a week this is evidence of their entire thinking on Islam and the defence of the west. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re going to treat Islam as a hostile political ideology. That is what has been needed for decades. It is the reversal of the â\\x80\\x9cIslam is a religion of peaceâ\\x80\\x9d doctrine set in place by Bush on September 17, 2001. Many polls show that majorities of Americans are skeptical of immigrantsâ\\x80\\x99 impact on American society, worry about imported jihad terrorism, oppose any increase above the current level of million immigrants per year  â\\x80\\x94   that is roughly one new immigrant for every four American births  â\\x80\\x94   and also oppose the continued inflow of cheap labor and unskilled refugees. For example, a September 2015 poll by Ipsos showed that: only 22 percent of Ipsosâ\\x80\\x99 respondents want the United States to accept 10, 000 or more migrants [per year]. That number includes 10 percent who want the country to accept 500, 000 or more migrants. Another 26 percent of Americans said they would accept up to 10, 000 refugees. The survey did not say that the country already accepts 70, 000 refugees per year.   percent said they want no additional refugees above the 1, 500, and 29 percent declined to answer the poll, indicating quiet opposition to greater inflows. An August 2016 poll of 2, 061 adults showed that:  three in ten Americans overall (36%) support taking in refugees from Syria. A majority of Democrats (56%) support admitting Syrian refugees in contrast only minorities of Republicans (18%) and Independents (32%) agree. These skeptical attitudes, however, are balanced with Americansâ\\x80\\x99 decent emotional welcome for most individual immigrants, and with their gratitude for the nationâ\\x80\\x99s generous history of immigration and support for constitutional rights. A December 2015  poll of 1, 140 registered voters by Quinnipiac showed that: most voters said Syrian refugees should not be allowed to come to the U. S. [but] most voters opposed banning all Muslims from coming to the U. S. with 66 percent of voters opposing the idea and 27 percent supporting a ban. A majority of Republicans, however, 51  â\\x80\\x94   41 percent, approved of a ban on Muslims entering the U. S. Democrats largely opposed a ban,   percent, as did independent voters,   percent. So the polling data suggests that Americans want their freedoms shared with Muslims now living in the United States  â\\x80\\x94   but they donâ\\x80\\x99t want more Muslims to come live in the United States. A February 2016 poll of Republicans in South Carolina showed that: When the poll asked â\\x80\\x9cWould you support or oppose banning Muslims from entering the United States?â\\x80\\x9d 60 percent of the stateâ\\x80\\x99s GOP voters said they would support a ban. But only 29 percent of respondents said they would â\\x80\\x9csupport   â\\x80¦     shutting down mosquesâ\\x80\\x9d in the United States, and only 25 percent said the disliked Islamic doctrines [of sharia] should be illegal. In June 2016, a poll of 803 registered voters was conducted by OpinionSavvy, via telephone, using automated questions, and with a margin of error of 3. 5 percent. First, the poll asked whether tourists and immigrants should be screened to check for their possible support of Islamic sharia. Seventy percent of respondents approved of the screening. The poll then asked the 70 percent â\\x80\\x9cDo you believe that individuals who support the practice of [Islamic] Sharia law should be admitted into the United States?â\\x80\\x9d  No, responded   of the 70 percent. That translates into 56 percent of total respondents preferring to exclude additional   Muslims. The overall opposition to the exclusion of sharia supporters added up to just 20 percent, with the rest undecided. The push and pull of these rival emotions, however, is overwhelmingly subordinated to Americansâ\\x80\\x99 lopsided desire that companies hire Americans first before importing more foreign immigrations or foreign contract workers. Polls show that roughly 80 percent of Americans say companies should hire of young Americans before hiring migrants. A July 2016 poll shows that roughly three out of four voters â\\x80\\x94   including nearly three out of four Democrat voters â\\x80\\x94   believe that â\\x80\\x9cinstead of giving jobs and healthcare to millions of refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and put Americans back to work. â\\x80\\x9d The view was shared by almost 90 percent of   and almost 70 percent of Hispanics.   In 2016, Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s focus on jobs for Americans  â\\x80\\x94   instead of additional immigration championed by Hillary Clinton  â\\x80\\x94   helped him win a critical majority in the   â\\x80\\x9cBlue Wallâ\\x80\\x9d states of Wisconsin Pennsylvania and Michigan. So now he is implementing the votersâ\\x80\\x99 preferences, amid a growing roar of protest from the   coalition of immigrant and   political activists. ',\n",

       " 'VIDEOS Globalist plan for human control The New World Order structure of global submission basically wants to remove free will from the human condition By Sartre   12:11 PM EST \\nRecognizing that there is and has been a centuryâ\\x80\\x99s long shrouded plan to mastermind a worldwide Weltanschauung that puts a diabolical elite mastery over the billions of human beings, which make up the vast hordes of divinely created life on this planet, is a taboo topic in most cultures. The entire system of socially manufactured perception is a plot to keep people in line and docile. Mass societal pressure is dumped on anyone, who dares to put forth a confederacy organism of global rule explanation for understanding political, social and economic affairs. Keeping the enigma program for extending a cruel and deadly supremacy over mankind cannot be kept secret any longer. \\nA brief and concise definition of The Globalist Agenda follows: \\nâ\\x80\\x9cSimply put, the globalist movement is an alliance based on self-interest of the private international financiers and the royal, dynastic and hereditary land owning families of Britain, Europe and America which over the years have intermarried to create a self regenerating power structure that through lies and deception seeks to control everything and everyone on earth.â\\x80\\x9d \\nReview the glaring elements that make up the demented mindset and ultimate objections of these demonic demons devoted to their satanic master. \\nThis summary of attitudes and aims might not be earth shattering for dedicated observers of the power elite, but for those who avoid any appearance of being tagged as a tin foil wearing conspiracy kook, mustering up the courage to confront the facts of real history may be too much to contemplate. Nullifying oneâ\\x80\\x99s comfort zone, even if it is totally false, is not an attribute for those who never developed character of sincerity or intellectual honesty. \\nProf. Dr. MUJAHID KAMRAN provides a well documented account of Who Really Controls the World? Coming from a non Western perspective, it is most encouraging that the exposure of the force beyond the scene is resonating in every corner of the planet. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe wealthiest families on planet earth call the shots in every major upheaval that they cause. Their sphere of activity extends over the entire globe, and even beyond, their ambition and greed for wealth and power knows no bounds, and for them, most of mankind is garbage â\\x80\\x93 â\\x80\\x9chuman garbage.â\\x80\\x9d It is also their target to depopulate the globe and maintain a much lower population compared to what we have now.â\\x80\\x9d \\nWhen The Communist Takeover Of America â\\x80\\x93 45 Declared Goals from â\\x80\\x9c The Naked Communist ,â\\x80\\x9d by Cleon Skousen was published, most people were diverted to thinking that a Marxist ideology was the primary enemy during the cold war. Left to the perceptive and astute, the most informed understand that the totalitarian creed of collectivism was originated and implemented by Jews. The influence of designed destruction for Western institutions and heritage, which facilitate and spreads the New World Order power structure, is the sacred canon of the privileged Globalist elites. \\nA serious researcher cannot ignore or circumvent this historic fact. Academic censorship would have the timid stay clear of this detail to avoid being smeared as a critic of the â\\x80\\x9cso calledâ\\x80\\x9d chosen tribe. Those who buy into this asinine prerequisite, which is the height of chutzpah, would be petrified to actually review the sentiments of What world famous men said about the Jews . \\nNow not every wicked globalist is exclusively Jewish. However, the proportion of Judaic race identity and Talmud proponents within the Globalist circle of black magic is overwhelmingly disproportionate to their population numbers. Also, there is no one single mythos viewpoint among globalists as The Two Jewish-led Globalist Campsâ\\x80¦ In Competition For Global Control illustrates. â\\x80\\x9cThere are two distinct ideological globalist camps, both led by Jews â\\x80\\x94 each camp competes with the other for global control: 1) THE LIBERAL CAMP 2) THE NEOCON CAMPâ\\x80\\x9d \\nThe inquiry into the influence of Jewish Faces in the Government can fill several books. Yet, the bias against covering this topic is so strong that only brave souls venture into the cauldron of popular culture ostracization. \\nIf you have the courage to venture where most will not dare, take a close look at the lists provided on THE GLOBALISTS site. The lead rundown presents: â\\x80\\x9cThe global elite march in four essential columns: Corporate, Academic, Political and Organized Religion . In general, the goals for globalism are created by Corporate . Academic then provides studies and white papers that justify Corporate goals. Political sells Academicâ\\x80\\x99s arguments to the public and if necessary, changes laws to accommodate and facilitate Corporate in getting what it wants. Organized Religion along with church and state secures corporate, academic and political rule into a global order.â\\x80\\x9d \\nThe lists of oligarch families, Committee of 300 and organized groups of the ruling class is a combination of dynasty elements that make up their cabal syndicate of power and dominance. The Rothschild linage bears the most attention for the central blood line of the international finance and the global cartel. Nevertheless, the choreographed architecture for governance goes well beyond an analysis of money, politics and force. \\nIn order to restrict the world view and impose a rigid abidance into an occult Babylonian religion, The Globalist Agenda contends: New Religion Based on Earth Worship \\nâ\\x80\\x9cToday, the elite are seeking to destroy the old religious belief systems and replace them with a â\\x80\\x9cnew ageâ\\x80\\x9d religion based on a form of earth worship. Doing so will accomplish multiple objectives â\\x80\\x93 to get people to accept lower standards of living; to accept voluntary sterilization to save mother earth thus helping to depopulate the planet; and to accept restrictions on rights and freedoms in the name of saving the environment.â\\x80\\x9d \\nThe Globalist Plan to take-down the whole World by Preston James, Ph.D postulates: \\nâ\\x80\\x9c Set up a comprehensive multi-level secret Luciferian matrix used to induce and promote selected individuals who are willing to do anti-human debased acts in exchange for extreme rewards of fame, money and power in return for their willingness to give up their souls. This provides a cadre of deeply committed sold-out top controllers who can be later disposed of when no longer needed. With abject secrecy their whole system becomes exposed and crumbles.â\\x80\\x9d \\nThis certainly sounds similar to the way the Plutocrat Jewery deviltry operates. For an evaluation on how The Dark Agenda Behind Globalism And Open Borders works, Zero Hedge sounds a familiar theme. \\nâ\\x80\\x9c The people behind the effort to enforce globalism are tied together by a particular ideology, perhaps even a cult-like religion , in which they envision a world order as described in Platoâ\\x80\\x99s Republic. They believe that they are â\\x80\\x9cchosenâ\\x80\\x9d either by fate, destiny or genetics to rule as philosopher kings over the rest of us. They believe that they are the wisest and most capable that humanity has to offer , and that through evolutionary means, they can create chaos and order out of thin air and mold society at will.â\\x80\\x9d \\nNow what group of self proclaimed super elites does this most scrupulously describe? \\nThe globalist plan for human servitude and ultimate liquidation is a direct result of the hubris from these deranged omnipotent imposters. Only through a sincere and dedicated investigation into the working of the â\\x80\\x9c Khazarian Mafia â\\x80\\x9d, a term penned by Dr. James, can one begin to comprehend the nature of the pandemic ethos that is at the core of the globalist cult. \\nWho better to conclude a dissecting of the Globalist Plan for Human Control than the teaching of Texe Marrs? From his Exclusive Intelligence Examiner Report you get an account you will not read in the controlled media. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cChildren of hell, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what Jesus called the Jewish religious teachers. That was almost 2,000 years ago. Well, guess what? The Jewish religionists are even worse now, in the 21st century. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve had almost 2,000 years more to practice and perfect their evil religion. Today, those who practice satanic cabalism and believe in the Talmud are the children of hell a hundred times over.â\\x80\\x9d \\nThe globalists adopt the practices and mores of this perversion from the Old Testament faith of Moses, Isaac, Jacob, and the prophets. Their design for a soulless existence and final mass annihilation is the essence of archfiend wickedness. The New World Order structure of global submission basically wants to remove free will from the human condition. \\nEvery thinking and God fearing person must resist and oppose the autocracy of the Tempter for global secularization. As more individuals assimilate into a reprobate culture that lacks faith in the divine word of God, the end collapse of society and all decency is inevitable.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is vetting federal appellate judges Merrick Garland and Sri Srinivasan as possible nominees to the Supreme Court to replace late Justice Antonin Scalia, the New York Times reported on Friday.  The FBI has been conducting background checks on Garland and Srinivasan, the Times said, citing a person with knowledge of the process. Scalia, a long-serving conservative justice, died on Feb. 13. Srinivasan, 49, has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals since he was confirmed on a 97-0 bipartisan vote in the U.S. Senate in May 2013. As a senior Justice Department lawyer in 2013, he was part of the legal team that successfully urged the high court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that restricted the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples for the purposes of federal benefits. Garland, 63, was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1997 and became the chief judge in 2013. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Republicans say the decision on who to nominate to the Supreme Court should be left to the next president, who will be elected on Nov. 8. Under the U.S. Constitution, the president nominates Supreme Court justices and the Senate must confirm them. Earlier this week, the Times said that federal appellate Judge Jane Kelly was being vetted. Last month the National Law Journal reported that Ketanji Brown Jackson, a federal trial judge in Washington, was also being considered. Without Scalia, the court has four conservative and four liberal justices, meaning any potential Obama nominee could tip the court to the left for the first time in decades. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, a moderate Republican, took himself out of consideration for appointment to the Supreme Court recently. ',\n",

Lissu underwent emergency surgery after being shot in the abdomen and other parts of the body by unknown gunmen outside his residence in the administrative capital Dodoma, they said.  Lissu has suffered multiple gunshot wounds and is being treated at the main public hospital in Dodoma,  said Tumaini Makene, spokesman for the main opposition CHADEMA party.

James Kiologwe, a doctor at Dodoma regional hospital, said Lissu was in stable condition. Police said an investigation had been launched into the attack on Lissu, a senior lawyer and CHADEMA s parliamentary chief whip. Police said they did not know what had motivated the attack and the suspects were still at large.  I have been saddened by reports of the shooting of Hon. Tundu Lissu. I pray for his quick recovery,  Magufuli said on Twitter.  Law enforcement agencies should hunt down all those involved in this barbaric act and bring them to justice.  Lissu is a vocal opponent of Magufuli and has been arrested on several occasions and charged with incitement. He was detained most recently in July after having called Magufuli a dictator.

       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - Thousands of people took to the streets of Tehran on Wednesday to bury a soldier whose beheading by Islamic State has come to symbolize the righteousness of Iran s military involvement in Syria. In what has become an iconic image on Iranian media, 25-year-old Revolutionary Guard Mohsen Hojaji is shown looking calmly into camera after his capture as he is led away by an insurgent with blood on his face, holding a knife. The photograph was posted by Islamic State. Even Iranians critical of their government s military intervention in Syria to help President Bashar al-Assad have taken to social media to express their admiration for Hojaji, who was killed last month. The Revolutionary Guards, Iran s most powerful military force who also oversee an economic empire worth billions of dollars, were initially quiet about their role in Syria. But in recent years, as casualties have mounted, they have been more outspoken about their engagement, framing it as an existential struggle against the Sunni Muslim extremists of Islamic State who see Shi ites, the majority of Iran s population, as apostates. Guards killed in Syria and Iraq are touted as protectors of Shi ite holy sites and labeled  defenders of the shrine  on websites linked to the Guards. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei prayed over Hojaji s coffin and met with his family on Wednesday, state media reported. Large crowds carrying red flags, symbolizing martyrdom, and pictures of Hojaji processed to the funeral in Tehran, pictures on state TV showed. Parliament speaker Ali Larijani and former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were among the dignitaries who attended, state media said.  Look at what a stir the martyrdom of this youth has created in the country,  Khamenei said, according to his website. Hojaji s funeral comes only three days before Ashura, one of the most important religious events for Shi ites and a traditional period of mourning which commemorates the death of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed. The Guards recovered Hojaji s body through a deal between Islamic State, the Syrian army and Lebanese Shi ite group Hezbollah. More than 300 IS fighters and about 300 family members were allowed to evacuate Syria s western border with Lebanon under the ceasefire agreement.  On June 7, Islamic State claimed an attack on Tehran s parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, killing 18 people. The Revolutionary Guards fired missiles at Islamic State bases in Syria on June 18 in response.     ',\n",

When it seized control of Mosul two years ago it issued an ultimatum to Christians: pay a tax, convert to Islam, or die by the sword. \\nREAD MORE: ANCIENT NINEVAH CHRISTIANS FEAR ISIS IN RETURN HOME \\nMost abandoned their homes and fled toward the autonomous Kurdish region, abandoning one of Christianity\\'s earliest centers. \\n\"Our role today is to remove all the remnants of Daesh,\" the archbishop said. \"This includes erasing sedition, separation and conflicts, which victimized us,\" said the archbishop, who was born in Qaraqosh. \\n\"Political and sectarian strife, separating between one man and another, between ruler and follower, these mentalities must be changed,â\\x80\\x9d he said. \\nChristianity in northern Iraq dates back to the first century AD.

       " 'Read by 2,559 people \\nThis article was written by Michael Snyder and originally published his End of the American Dream site. \\nEditorâ\\x80\\x99s Comment: It is almost as if this unprecedented election was designed to bring about chaos. Half the country seem to vehemently hate one of the two candidates, and the election of either one may have been enough to start opposition riots, clashes in the street or worse â\\x80\\x93 widespread, ongoing violence in all corners of the country. The perception that Hillary won the popular vote and pending official totals, which are even now subject to change, are likely to further fuel anger and division among leftist supporters whoâ\\x80\\x99ve long feared a Trump presidency. \\nWhile many people in the patriot movement are breathing a sigh of relief at the defeat of the establishmentâ\\x80\\x99s candidate, it seems that millions on the left are now emotionally tied to a huge collectivist government, and are willing to fight for their own enslavement. Is America peaking out of the darkness, or about to enter into its darkest phase yet? \\nDid America Really Pass The Test? â\\x80\\x93 Hillary Clinton Is Going To Win The Popular Vote By A Wide Margin \\nby Michael Snyder \\nThe 2016 election was a test, and it would be easy to assume that since Donald Trump won the election that America passed the test. Unfortunately, it may not be that simple. A closer look at the numbers reveals a very sobering reality. Yes, Donald Trump won far more electoral votes than Hillary Clinton did, and that means that he is on track to become our next president . But Hillary Clinton is going to win the popular vote, and it is likely to be by a very wide margin once all the votes are counted. \\nAs I write this article, Hillary Clinton has a lead of 218,000 in the popular vote, but most of the votes that have not been counted are on the west coast. \\nIn California, Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by a 5,482,166 to 2,966,654 margin, and only 68 percent of the vote has been counted so far. So assuming that the ratio stays about the same the rest of the way, Clinton is going to add at least a million more votes to her lead just from the state of California. \\nUp in Washington state, Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by more than 370,000 votes, and only 60 percent of the vote has been counted there so far. So she could easily pick up another 200,000 votes in that state. \\nWhen everything is all said and done, it seems very likely that Hillary Clinton will have received well over a million more votes than Donald Trump did in this election. \\nSo the truth is that the American people chose Hillary Clinton, but because of some electoral college magic Donald Trump is the winner of the election. \\nAnd I am certainly very, very happy that Hillary Clinton is not going to be our next president. Four years under her â\\x80\\x9cleadershipâ\\x80\\x9d would have likely been the final nail in the coffin for our nation. My hope is that she will now disappear from national politics for good. \\nBut just because she is not going to be our next president does not mean that we passed the test. \\nIn this election, the American people were faced with a very stark choice. Hillary Clinton is the most wicked politician that our country has ever seen, and over the past three decades the American people have gotten to know exactly who she is and what she stands for. \\nAnd despite knowing exactly what they would be getting, more Americans voted for her than voted for Donald Trump. \\nIf every vote counted equally, she would be our next president. \\nI certainly donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to rain on the Trump parade. Christians, conservatives and patriots are right to celebrate this victory by Donald Trump. But the truth is that I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe that we did actually pass the test that we were faced with. \\nAs a nation, we willingly chose Hillary Clinton by a pretty substantial margin. \\nAnd donâ\\x80\\x99t think that the radical left is going to forget that Trump lost the popular vote. Already, violence and protests have erupted all over the nation. \\nShortly after Trump declared victory, riots broke out in Berkeley, San Jose and Oakland â\\x80¦ \\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot my president! Not my president!â\\x80\\x9d chanted anti-Trump rioters in Berkley, California as they light flares and storm the streets. \\nRiots erupted in Berkley, San Jose and Oakland shortly after the announcement of Donald Trump as president-elect. Rioters are breaking into stores, vandalizing cars and shooting flares. \\nOne woman in Oakland was hit by a car on Highway 24 just after midnight and has suffered serious injuries after. When she pulled over to the right shoulder, she was surrounded by anti-Trump rioters, who vandalized her car and broke the back window, according to CHP officers. \\nThere were reports of protesters burning American flags in some areas of the country, and there were even brawls outside of the White House . \\nAnd once the sun set on Wednesday night, the protests started again. According to USA Today , â\\x80\\x9cthousands of demonstratorsâ\\x80\\x9d have hit the streets in New York Cityâ\\x80¦ \\nIn New York, thousands of demonstrators blocked off streets around Trump Tower near the busy intersection of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, chanting â\\x80\\x9chey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to goâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cpâ\\x80\\x94y grabs back,â\\x80\\x9d a reference to tape of a Trump conversation from years back in which he One woman protester was topless while another climbed on top of a tree to see the activity. Taxis, city buses and passenger vehicles stood at a standstill. \\nIn Boston, radical leftists were organizing a giant protest against Trump â\\x80¦ \\nFar-left organizers are planning a mass protest in Boston against President-elect Donald Trump, citing the need to â\\x80\\x9cimmediately start fighting against him.â\\x80\\x9d \\nApproximately 2,300 people have indicated they will gather outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston tonight for a â\\x80\\x9cBoston Against Trump Rally.â\\x80\\x9d According to the Facebook event page, another 5,000 people say they may be interested in attending. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonald Trump is the next President of the United States. We need to immediately start fighting against him. We need to build a movement to fight racism, sexism, and Islamophobia,â\\x80\\x9d the event description says. \\nSadly, this could be the beginning of a new era of protests, rioting and civil unrest. \\nInstead of coming together behind the new president, the radical left seems ready to go to war. \\nSo even though Trump won the election, the truth is that our troubles may only just be starting. More than half the country didnâ\\x80\\x99t want Trump, our nation was already more divided than it has been in decades before he won, and it wonâ\\x80\\x99t take much for many of our big cities to descend into utter chaos. \\nWithout a doubt, we should be very excited that Donald Trump won the election, but an election victory is not going to magically make our problems go away. \\nWhen faced with the most monumental election in any of our lifetimes, Hillary Clinton received the most votes from the American people, and the consequences for that decision may be far more severe than most people are now anticipating. \\nMichael T.

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - A majority of Americans are ready to move on from healthcare reform at this point after the U.S. Senateâ\\x80\\x99s effort to dismantle Obamacare failed on Friday, according to an exclusive Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Saturday. Nearly two-thirdsÂ\\xa0of the country wants to either keep or modify the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, and a majority of Americans want Congress to turn its attention to other priorities, the survey found. Republicans have vowed to dismantle the Affordable Care Act since Democratic President Barack Obama signed it into law in 2010, and it appeared they finally had their chance when Republican President Donald Trump took office in January. But the law, which helped 20 million people obtain health insurance, has steadily grown more popular. The July 28-29 poll of more than 1,130 Americans, conducted after the Republican-led effort collapsed in the Senate, found that 64 percent said they wanted to keep Obamacare, either â\\x80\\x9centirely as isâ\\x80\\x9d or after fixing â\\x80\\x9cproblem areas.â\\x80\\x9d That is up from 54 percent in January.  The survey found that support for the law still runs along party lines, with nine out of 10 Democrats and just three out of 10 Republicans saying they wanted to keep or modify Obamacare. Among Republicans, three-fourths said they would like their partyâ\\x80\\x99s leaders to try to repeal and replace Obamacare at some point, though most listed other issues that they would give a higher priority right now.  Disappointment among Republicans and happiness among Democrats about the repealâ\\x80\\x99s failure were palpable. Two-thirds of Republicans felt â\\x80\\x9cbadâ\\x80\\x9d that the Senate failed to pass a healthcare bill, while three-fourths of Democrats felt â\\x80\\x9cgood,â\\x80\\x9d according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll. When asked what they think Congress should do next, most Americans picked other priorities such as tax reform, foreign relations and infrastructure. Only 29 percent said they wanted Republicans in Congress to â\\x80\\x9ccontinue working on a new healthcare bill.â\\x80\\x9d Gene Anderson, 81, a Trump voter living in a retirement community in Zionsville, Indiana, said the president should â\\x80\\x9crefocus on some stability in his administration and some demonstration of being able to work together with Democrats in Congress.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t understand why they had to push for healthcare reform before tax reform,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThey ought to sit down and come up with a viable legislative, doable tax reform.â\\x80\\x9d Americans appear to be more supportive of some of the main features of Obamacare. For example, 77 percent said they were in favor of expanding Medicaid to low-income families, and 43 percent said they favored requiring U.S. residents to own health insurance. That was up from 66 percent and 36 percent, respectively, when Reuters/Ipsos first asked those questions in April 2012. The latest Republican effort failed when Senator John McCain split from his partyâ\\x80\\x99s leadership and joined Republican colleagues Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowksi and Senate Democrats to vote against a so-called skinny repeal eliminating certain aspects of Obamacare. McCain later said the measure â\\x80\\x9coffered no replacement to actually reform our healthcare system.â\\x80\\x9d Respondents said they thought a lot of people shared responsibility for the failure on healthcare. When asked who â\\x80\\x9cis most responsible,â\\x80\\x9d 20 percent picked Senate Republicans, 13 percent said Trump, and 11 percent said McCain. The rest picked Senate Democrats and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as Senators Collins and Murkowski. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,136 people, including 381 Republicans and 475 Democrats. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. ',\n",
       " 'LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenia s Prime Minister, Miro Cerar, has canceled a visit to Croatia, accusing the neighboring state of reigniting a long-running maritime dispute, his office said on Friday. Cerar called off next week s trip after his Croatian counterpart, Andrej Plenkovic, told the U.N. General Assembly that an international ruling on their shared waters was invalid. The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in June that Slovenia should have  uninterrupted access  to the sea it shares with Croatia. Croatia objected at the time, and Plenkovic said he had merely repeated his country s position at the United Nations on Thursday.  In my speech there was nothing new about Croatia s position, I mentioned the facts... We remain open for dialogue with Slovenia and I invite Cerar to come to Croatia on some other date,  Plenkovic told a cabinet session in Zagreb. The countries have been arguing over a stretch of their sea and land border since both declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991 as it disintegrated into war and broke up. The dispute, which centers on the bay of Piran, held up Croatian accession to the EU for many years. Only after both parties agreed to arbitration was Zagreb granted entry to the bloc in 2013 - though it later withdrew from the proceedings. The Hague-based court ruled that Slovenia gets the vast majority of the Piran bay area recognized as its territorial waters.  In addition, the tribunal established a 2.5 nautical-mile wide and some 10 nautical-mile long corridor through Croatian waters to give Slovenia much-coveted direct access to international waters.

       " 'While Obama golfs in Martha s Vineyard, yet another  decision is made to allow a terrorist to return to his homeland. Way to honor our troops who have lost their lives to these evil men Barry President Barack Obama s multi-agency Periodic Review Board (PRB) has approved an al Qaeda-linked Algerian prisoner for release from the U.S. military detention center in Guant namo Bay, Cuba, conceding that the jihadist  presents some level of threat. However, PRB claims that the threat posed by the 43-year-old, Sufiyan Barhoumi, can be  adequately mitigated,  in part due to  his lack of extremist views. At one point, the Pentagon deemed the prisoner to be  high risk,  linked to key al Qaeda leadership, and accused him of participating in  hostilities against the US and coalition forces. Barhoumi was identified by the Pentagon as an explosive s expert and Al-Qaeda trainer.He has been held at Guant namo since mid June 2002 and on Tuesday became the second detainee to be approved for release by the Gitmo board after presenting a letter of support from a former guard, notes the Miami Herald.In a statement announcing its latest decision, Obama s parole board notes:The Board recommends repatriation to Algeria due to the detainees strong family support and Algeria s strong record in prior transfers, with security appropriate security assurances as negotiated by the Special Envoys and agreed by relevant USG [US government] departments and agencies.Algeria has been listed by the U.S. government as a terrorism-linked country.Barhoumi presented PRB with a detailed plan to open a pizza shop near his mom in the Algerian capital of Algiers, reports the Miami Herald.For entire story: Breitbart News',\n",

He called me right after the sessions and even offered a Skype communication if I wanted. He knew that I had done lots of work on myself in past lives, which confirmed to me that he was real, because I was a Tibetan Monk and they spend a life time working on their karma. He is as good as Pam was as a healer. \\nThat same night I had lots of energy, I could not sleep, I felt well. The next 4 days I felt very tired, I could not get enough sleep.

       " 'The gazebo at the Cudell Recreation Center in Cleveland, Ohio has become a non-official memorial for Tamir Rice, an innocent 12-year-old who was shot and killed by the police. The gazebo is the location where Rice was killed while playing with a toy rifle.According to Belt Magazine, the location has also recently become a popular stop in the smash hit augmented reality game, Pok mon Go. For those not familiar how the game works, locations of interest   called Pokestops   such as public works of art, historical locations, and other community hot spots.The person who suggested the location be added as a location in the game developer s database took the opportunity to make a statement. The description for the pokestop reads: Community memorial for Tamir Rice, shot and killed by CPD officers who shot him in under 2s after breaking department policy regarding escalation of force. The Cudell Gazebo bears no marker indicating that is a memorial for Rice. The gazebo was scheduled to be demolished though it has not due to certain groups who wish to see the area preserved as a historical landmark. As of right now, the gazebo has remained in a state of limbo. So, besides the stuffed animals and other tokens left by community members, there is no way to tell what the historical importance of what the location is.This virtual marker runs contrary to the findings of a grand jury who decided not to bring charges against the officers involved in the shooting.A commentator on the Belt claims to be the person who wrote the description for the Gazebo. He claims that he wrote the description not thinking that it would be noticed by many people, as it was added to a much less popular game created by the same company who created Pokemon Go. He writes that he wrote the description because: Memorials are built in the hope people will remember. The events that ended Tamir Rice s life are something that I worry will be forgotten. It was difficult to see the gazebo pictured without context, and I added a bit without expecting it to be noticed by anyone else. The gazebo in the park should be turned into an official memorial for Rice. However, even if it was the spot would not tell the story that so many people hear. It is nice to know that there are people able to get what many would consider the truth of the story of what happened at that spot than what is on the official record.Featured image from Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images',\n",

Certainly, many of us grumble when an article about aliens invading New York City passes through our newsfeeds only to be taken seriously â\\x80\\x94 but the so-called â\\x80\\x9cproblemâ\\x80\\x9d of â\\x80\\x9cfakeâ\\x80\\x9d news Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s Mark Zuckerberg is referring to isnâ\\x80\\x99t targeting such vapid content. What Facebook will target, however, should concern all of us. After the absurdity that was the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton supporters and establishment Democrats excoriated Zuckerberg for dereliction of duty in failing to remove sham news articles and sites from his wildly popular platform â\\x80\\x94 because, in their eyes, this putative â\\x80\\x9cfakeâ\\x80\\x9d news literally swung the election toward Donald Trump .But this seemingly hapless campaign of finger-pointing â\\x80\\x94 the Clinton camp also railed against FBI Director James Comey, among many others, in their search to blame anyone but themselves â\\x80\\x94 has nothing at all to do with inane articles of no worth. Rather, the new war on â\\x80\\x9cfakeâ\\x80\\x9d news is simply a poorly-disguised attempt to quash legitimate information unfavorable to the liberal establishmentâ\\x80\\x99s agenda â\\x80\\x94 for good. This perilous course of blanketing, State-sponsored censorship marks what might be the most overarching effort to kill dissenting opinion in decades â\\x80\\x94 perhaps approaching or exceeding the height of the Red Scare and McCarthyism. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s why: Mark Zuckerberg, a known proponent of establishment narrative and supporter of liberal goals, originally responded to this criticism somewhat rationally, saying the actual percentage of imposter news items is so miniscule, it could not possibly have affected the outcome of the election. Heâ\\x80\\x99s right. Or at least, he was. â\\x80\\x9cOf all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,â\\x80\\x9d the Facebook head wrote in a post to his site on Saturday. â\\x80\\x9cThe hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.â\\x80\\x9d After the failed Clinton campaign turned and targeted Zuckerberg and Facebook with its bitter wrath of loss, he abruptly switched his tune â\\x80\\x94 and a plan is now underway for how to â\\x80\\x9ccopeâ\\x80\\x9d with this â\\x80\\x9cfakeâ\\x80\\x9d news [non] â\\x80\\x9cproblem.â\\x80\\x9d Itâ\\x80\\x99s imperative to consider several points concerning Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s burgeoning war â\\x80\\x94 with over one billion users worldwide, no staff would be large enough to combat reports of fraudulent news that will undoubtedly be rolling in soon. So, the plan? Artificial intelligence â\\x80\\x94 a self-teaching algorithm to identify and remove the supposedly counterfeit news items, and likely relegate the source as a Scarlet Letter verboten site. But an issue of grave concern has already arisen before the war on fake news even gets off the ground. Business Insider boasted in a headline â\\x80\\x9cIt took only 36 hours for these students to solve Facebookâ\\x80\\x99s fake-news problemâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94 but thereâ\\x80\\x99s a serious problem. Their algorithm failed. Miserably. In fact, one of the two items touted by Business Insider as proof of the success of the spurious news-slaying algorithm can be proven factually true â\\x80\\x94 nearly verbatim â\\x80\\x94 on the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s own website. According to Business Insider, the four students from various top universities participated in a recent hack-a-thon at Princeton University â\\x80\\x94 which Facebook co-sponsored . In a mere 36 hours, they created an extension for the Chrome browser to ostensibly identify and parse out whether suspicious items constitute legitimate, truthful news, called â\\x80\\x9c FiB: Stop living a lie .â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt classifies every post, be it pictures (Twitter snapshots), adult content pictures, fake links, malware links, fake news links as verified or non-verified using artificial intelligence,â\\x80\\x9d one of the students told the outlet. â\\x80\\x9cFor links, we take into account the websiteâ\\x80\\x99s reputation, also query it against malware and phishing websites database and also take the content, search it on Google/Bing, retrieve searches with high confidence and summarize that link and show to the user. â\\x80\\x9cFor pictures like Twitter snapshots, we convert the image to text, use the usernames mentioned in the tweet, to get all tweets of the user and check if current tweet was ever posted by the user.â\\x80\\x9d Appearing smug in the articleâ\\x80\\x99s lead picture, Nabanita De, a second-year masterâ\\x80\\x99s student in computer science student at UMass Amherst; Anant Goel a freshmen in Purdue University; Mark Craft, a sophomore at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and Catherine Craft, a sophomore also at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, all believe theyâ\\x80\\x99ve discovered the quick fix to Zuckerbergâ\\x80\\x99s [now] problem. As an example, the extension identified and marked an article â\\x80\\x9cnot verifiedâ\\x80\\x9d; but the article, a report touting findings from the National Cancer Institute which appeared on the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s National Institute on Drug Abuse site â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cMarijuana Kills Cancer Cells, Admits the U.S. National Cancer Instituteâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94 isnâ\\x80\\x99t fake at all. From the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s site , with emphasis added: â\\x80\\x9cNIH-funded and other researchers are continuing to explore the possible uses of THC, CBD, and other cannabinoids for medical treatment. â\\x80\\x9cFor instance, recent animal studies have shown that marijuana extracts may help kill certain cancer cells and reduce the size of others . â\\x80\\x9cEvidence from one cell culture study suggests that purified extracts from whole-plant marijuana can slow the growth of cancer cells from one of the most serious types of brain tumors. â\\x80\\x9cResearch in mice showed that treatment with purified extracts of THC and CBD , when used with radiation, increased the cancer-killing effects of the radiation.â\\x80\\x9d Beyond this one example, and much further to the point, the Democratic establishment is leading the call to abolish â\\x80\\x9cfakeâ\\x80\\x9d news â\\x80\\x94 a blaring alarm bell for anyone paying attention this election cycle. A trove of published leaked emails and documents by Wikileaks concerning the Democratic National Committee, campaign chair John Podesta, and Hillary Clinton , proved a staggering degree of corruption and collusion undertaken for years by establishment insiders and corporate media, which, for all intents and purposes, amounted to an attempt to throw the election in their favor. As the campaign came under heavy fire from all sides, Clintonites were quick to shift blame and try to discredit the mountainous evidence of wrongdoing â\\x80\\x94 first by blaming Wikileaks for trying to throw the election, then by claiming the information being published was fake. Except it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t. For nearly the entire duration of its existence, Wikileaks has offered a prize of several hundred thousand dollars for anyone who can prove even a single document it published isnâ\\x80\\x99t authentic . And that bounty, though challenged from time to time, remains unclaimed. And now the outgoing Democratic party wants to initiate a war on fake news? Nothing to see here, folks. â\\x80\\x9cEveryone has the right to say what they want, have access to sites that they want, share what they want,â\\x80\\x9d Obama and Democrat Party insider , Teddy Goff, told Politico â\\x80\\x94 which, incidentally, starred in several damning emails for colluding with the Clinton campaign. â\\x80\\x9cBut a publisher with a record of making stuff up is not likely to rank that highly on Google, and the equivalent ought to be the case on Facebook. [â\\x80¦] â\\x80\\x9cTwo, three weeks ago, many of us are beginning to talk about what a big problem this is, both from the campaign and from the administration, and just sort of broader Obama orbit, and are talking about, this is one of the things we would like to take on post-election. â\\x80\\x9cThis is something we were very aware of, saw zero percent chance Facebook was going to be compliant or work with us during the election, but wanted to take on post-election.â\\x80\\x9d Recall the aforementioned and justifiable doubt Zuckerberg originally expressed about the nonexistent â\\x80\\x9cproblemâ\\x80\\x9d of â\\x80\\x9cfakeâ\\x80\\x9d news â\\x80\\x94 and consider Goff told Politico these ostensibly false news items posted to Facebook painted â\\x80\\x98Clinton as corrupt, criminal or otherwise beyond the political pale.â\\x80\\x99 In fact, evidence of corruption, media collusion, and highly questionable, if not explicitly criminal, activity now mar Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s legacy as Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee â\\x80\\x94 not because of bogus reporting. There was no need for fake items, and â\\x80\\x94 although a few websites certainly blew points out of proportion â\\x80\\x94 the emails, themselves damned Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s campaign. Thus, the liberal establishmentâ\\x80\\x99s war on fake news â\\x80\\x94 for which the head of the largest social media platform has now been roped in â\\x80\\x94 amounts to little more than a witch hunt to silence truthful, but damaging, information. Information vital to the American public, imperative for making informed choices, and indispensable if this nation is still to be characterized as maintaining even a shred of freedom. Employing failed algorithms â\\x80\\x94 or even people â\\x80\\x94 is a hopelessly flawed solution to a problem that simply doesnâ\\x80\\x99t exist. And what will result is a war on alternative, independent media and opposing thought â\\x80\\x94 in all forms. Considering the insidious, wholly one-sided nature of this plan, it would be errant not to draw parallels to a new McCarthyism. Indeed, independent media websites likely did help turn the election away from Hillary Clinton â\\x80\\x94 not by posting inane, false garbage, or slanted reporting â\\x80\\x94 but by having the integrity to post the truth about her dealings behind the scenes. And, where corporate media failed in journalistic integrity and due diligence, alternative sources â\\x80\\x94 led by Wikileaks â\\x80\\x94 excelled. Had the same vault of information surfaced about Trump, alternative media would have had the same field day â\\x80\\x94 and thatâ\\x80\\x99s where the Clintonites have it all wrong. Fake news â\\x80\\x94 dissenting opinion, opposing viewpoints, a free press â\\x80\\x94 none of that tilted the election. Unless, of course, by fake news they are referring to corporate mediaâ\\x80\\x99s submitting articles to the Clinton campaign prior to editors, or Hillary insiders collaborating on articles so ensure the â\\x80\\x98rightâ\\x80\\x99 angle was employed â\\x80\\x94 or any of the examples proven in leaked documents. Nominating Hillary when a veritable revolution erupted behind Bernie Sanders, however, did. It would behoove them to turn tail, learn the lesson, and walk away, instead of imposing a blanketing and unnecessary campaign of censorship against â\\x80\\x9cfakeâ\\x80\\x9d news when the truth is a bitter pill to swallow. Meanwhile, the Mainstream Media has been caught faking news countless times, which had serious consequences worldwide:',\n",
       " 'November 7, 2016, 5:26 pm A+ | a- Oops! Please log in to use this feature. \\nFrom the New York Times : \\nBy Juan Prieto \\nON CAMPUS NOV. 7, 2016 \\nBERKELEY, Calif. â\\x80\\x94 Although the University of California, Berkeley, has some of the best resources in the country for undocumented students like me â\\x80\\x94 in the form of financial and legal aid, for example â\\x80\\x94 itâ\\x80\\x99s been a tense couple of years, magnified by the anti-immigration build-a-wall language of Donald J. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s presidential campaign. Berkeleyâ\\x80\\x99s Undocumented Student Program , which the university established in 2012, works with more than 400 undocumented students and continues to grow as more go public about their immigration status, sometimes at considerable risk to themselves and their families. \\nBut by coming out of the shadows, undocumented people open themselves to cruelty and threats. Last year, when I helped organize a campus protest to get the University of California to renew funding for some crucial programs for undocumented students, I was called an illegal leech who should be deported. I shrugged it off: I was proud of marching at Berkeley, where the Free Speech Movement started in the 1960s. \\nBut looking back, I think I should have made a bigger deal about the maliciousness I witnessed and saw building. A few months later, I received an anonymous email threatening to report my family and me to immigration agents. The threat included details about my actions during the protest â\\x80\\x94 it seemed to be coming from someone who had seen me on campus. I was so disturbed I stopped attending classes, and even when I returned a week later, my anxiety kept me from engaging in class discussions or focusing on my studies. \\nSoon after that, the Undocumented Student Program began to receive anonymous email threats about students, and a fellow undocumented friend â\\x80\\x94 a prominent member of the student government â\\x80\\x94 was told by another student on Facebook: â\\x80\\x9cThanks for identifying yourself as an illegal â\\x80¦ Now get out. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll look for you on campus.â\\x80\\x9d All of this information was brought to the administration, but there was no follow-up. \\nI.e., the illegal alien is complaining there was no follow up against the American citizens for reporting the presence of illegal aliens. \\nâ\\x80¦ This September, after a group of Trump supporters came onto campus to build a mock wall and spew racially charged talk about â\\x80\\x9cillegals,â\\x80\\x9d the undocumented students were told to draft a statement of inclusion as a response, and that perhaps certain departments would send it through their email listservs as a gesture of support. \\nAdministrators have said they are determined to earn our trust, but undocumented students on campus donâ\\x80\\x99t want to be placated â\\x80\\x94 we want our administrators to fully stand with us through actions and not just promises. After all, when posters with anti-Semitic language began to crop up around campus in late September, the associate chancellor took swift action by sending an email to all students condemning this language. \\nSome argue that hateful displays of racism or anti-Semitism are different from the actions of those on campus who yell, â\\x80\\x9cBuild a wall!â\\x80\\x9d But too often, hate speech toward immigrants in this country is written off as political opinion, and school administrators donâ\\x80\\x99t want to side with one political group or another. However, this political issue happens to be our futures, in the country where we grew up. \\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s why it was disheartening when Janet Napolitano, the president of the University of California system â\\x80\\x94 and, it should be noted, the former head of the Department of Homeland Security â\\x80\\x94 wrote, in a Boston Globe op-ed essay , that students must be willing to listen to not just opposing views, but offensive ones, for the sake of free speech. She did not condone hate speech â\\x80\\x94 â\\x80\\x9cthat which is designed to personally intimidate or harassâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 but wrote that exceptions to free speech should be â\\x80\\x9cnarrowly construed.â\\x80\\x9d \\nSo many powerful college administrators across the country have made this argument now that I think they have no idea just how offensive speech has gotten, especially during this election. \\nThis is not to say that those with conservative opinions should be silenced. \\nJebâ\\x80\\x99s opinions on undocumented workers, for example, should not be silenced. \\nBut because it is often campus conservatives who complain of the scourge of political correctness, I think it is tempting for college administrators to rally behind conservative students, to see them as the new gadflies, the protectors of free speech. Yet it is comical to think that those of us with lesser rights are somehow infringing on those who have no fear of deportation. \\nJuan Prieto is a senior at the University of California, Berkeley. \\nNow, you might think that thereâ\\x80\\x99s something ungracious about an illegal alien denouncing Americaâ\\x80\\x99s First Amendment. But â\\x80\\x94 donâ\\x80\\x99t you realize? â\\x80\\x94 heâ\\x80\\x99s Undocumented ? That makes him holier than you. Some topics, such as immigration policy, are therefore just too sacred to be discussed anywhere where there are undocumented workers, undocumented students, undocumented welfare recipients, or undocumented criminals, such as the United States. \\nPersonally, Iâ\\x80\\x99m an undocumented alumnus of Berkeley with an undocumented Ph.D. in physics and an undocumented Nobel Prize. For some reason, though, the King of Sweden wasnâ\\x80\\x99t welcoming of me the last time I walked up on stage with my speech. â\\x80\\x9cNot you again,â\\x80\\x9d the king said. â\\x80\\x9c Garde !â\\x80\\x9d \\nI blame Trump.',\n",
       " 'Minnesota is home to the largest number of Somali immigrants in America.  Census numbers put the state s Somali s population at about 40,000, but community activists have said it s higher. The largest share of that group has settled in the Minneapolis area, including one neighborhood near the University of Minnesota campus that s been dubbed  Little Mogadishu.  But significant numbers have also settled in St. Cloud, Willmar and other smaller cities.Being home to the largest number of Somali immigrants in America doesn t come without a price WND   For the second time in just over a year, a Somali  refugee  has stabbed shoppers with a knife at a Minnesota mall.The first case, on Sept. 17, 2016, was a clear act of jihad when Dahir Adan injured 10 people in the Macy s at the Crossroads Center Mall in St. Cloud after asking his victims, chosen at random, if they were Muslim.But on Sunday night a man identified as Mahad Abdiaziz Abdirahman, 20, of Minneapolis stabbed two men at the Mall of America after they tried to stop him from stealing clothes inside the dressing room at Macy s.His middle name, Abdiaziz, means  the slave of Allah the master,  a native Arabic speaker told WND.His first name, Mahad, means  the one who preaches and invites people to Islam. Wow! Talk about the perfect ambassdor for Islam According to the NYP, Abdirahaman sneaked into a men s fitting room at the Minnesota mall and tried to swipe something from a customer s belongings while the man was outside the fitting room modeling clothes for his family. But he caught Abdirahaman in the act, and the would-be thief pulled a knife and stabbed him, authorities said.Hearing the victim s screams, his family rushed to his aid, but Abdirahaman slashed a second person before they could wrest the knife from him.The scuffle and ensuing response by police freaked out nearby shoppers waiting in line for their kids to see Santa.Violence by Somali immigrants against Minneapolis residents is nothing new to people who have watched the Somali population explode in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.Last year, we reported about a mob of up to 30 young Somali men paraded through one of Minneapolis  more upscale neighborhoods last week, yelling disparaging comments and threats against homeowners.A female resident of the neighborhood, obviously shaken in a TV interview, related how she was screamed at by a Somali man who threatened to kidnap and rape her. They were screaming at the house that they were going to kidnap you and they were going to rape you,  one Minneapolis resident told KSTP TV.  It was a very traumatizing experience. Somalis living in Minneapolis are almost all Sunni Muslims, and residents of the Lake Calhoun area say this isn t the first time a group of Somali men has made an intimidating march through their neighborhood, which is filled with million-dollar homes.Go HERE for video to see homeowner tell her horrifying story.

       " 'FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germanyâ\\x80\\x99s largest bank has asked for more time to respond to a request from Democrats on a U.S. House of Representatives panel for details about U.S. President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s possible ties to Russia, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. Deutsche Bankâ\\x80\\x99s (DBKGn.DE) external counsel sent a letter dated Friday June 2 to the Democrats saying it needed additional time, the source told Reuters. The person spoke on condition of anonymity and declined to specify how much more time the bankâ\\x80\\x99s counsel needed.  Several Democrats on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee sent a letter last month to John Cryan, chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank, seeking details that might show if Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s loans for his real estate business were backed by the Russian government. The letter asked for details of internal reviews of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s transactions and gave the German bank until Friday to respond.  Deutsche Bank has declined to comment about any business dealings with Trump. The Republican president is mired in controversy over FBI and congressional probes into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign. Moscow has denied the allegations, and Trump has denied any collusion. Maxine Waters, Democrat representative for California and a member of the committee, was one of the original letterâ\\x80\\x99s five signatories. She confirmed through a staff member on Monday that Deutsche did not provide â\\x80\\x9csubstantive responses to our requestsâ\\x80\\x9d. â\\x80\\x9cCongress remains in the dark on whether loans Deutsche Bank made to President Trump were guaranteed by the Russian government, or were in any way connected to Russia,â\\x80\\x9d the Democrats wrote in their request to Deutsche Bank.  â\\x80\\x9cIt is critical that you provide this committee with the information necessary to assess the scope, findings and conclusions of your internal reviews,â\\x80\\x9d they said. The Democrats cannot compel Deutsche Bank to hand over the information. The House committee has the power to subpoena the documents, but Republican committee members - who make up the majority of the panel - would have to cooperate. No Republicans have signed the document request. The congressional inquiry is also seeking information about a Russian â\\x80\\x9cmirror tradingâ\\x80\\x9d scheme that allowed $10 billion to flow out of Russia. In January, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $630 million in fines for organizing the scheme that could have been used to launder money out of Russia. The trades involved, for example, buying Russian stocks in roubles for a client and selling the identical value of a security for U.S. dollars for a related customer. ',\n",

The new plan will keep two important provisions of Obamacare. Protections for pre-existing conditions will remain in place and parents will continue to be able to keep their children on their policies until age 26.Now, the bad.

       " 'Many Republicans in Congressional leadership are touting their idiotic  repeal and delay  plan as the perfect way to repeal the ACA without kicking millions off their insurance plans. People like Mitch McConnell are already acting like it s done deal. People like Paul Ryan think things like tax-free health savings accounts are the answer to our healthcare woes. Trump himself has said he wants the repeal to happen as soon as possible. So it should be a foregone conclusion that all of this is happening in the very near future.Except it might not.Republicans need 50 votes in the Senate to pass their repeal. They have 52 seats. If they lose three votes, they ll have 49.With just 49 votes, the repeal effort fails.But which three? The truth is that not every Republican is happy with the idea of repealing the law now and working on a replacement later. They ve had six years to come up with a replacement, as Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) acknowledges. They haven t done so. The idea that they can now come up with a good replacement before millions lose their healthcare coverage is laughable at best, but really, it s cold-blooded fuckery.Corker, along with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), strongly oppose passing any repeals without simultaneously passing their replacement plan.These are the three who are likely to derail the repeal effort.Even better (worse?) is that Corker, along with Sens. Rob Portman (R-OH), Susan Collins (R-ME), Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have introduced an amendment to the repeal bill that would push the vote back a month:Five GOP senators offer an amendment to extend the Obamacare repeal reconciliation deadline by more than a MONTH. pic.twitter.com/8MPlAy50mR  Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) January 9, 2017That goes directly against Mitch McConnell s insistence that they ll repeal the law soon, and then come up with a replacement  rapidly,  which happened over the weekend in an interview on CBS   Face the Nation.  However, he couldn t give us anything like a timetable for the replacement, even though he was pressed hard.Let s also not forget all the Republican governors who are currently trying to pressure Congress into holding off repealing the ACA. These are governors who ve seen massive benefits to their states from the Medicaid expansion in the ACA. A full repeal means all states that expanded Medicaid will lose their federal funding for it. Governors, regardless of party, hate that.Democrats will block repeal efforts as best they can not just because they oppose Republicans, but because what paltry fragments of plans the Republicans do have rob from the poor to give to the rich. For instance, they want to greatly expand the use of health savings accounts, which helps absolutely no one who can t afford to put any money away for anything (like retirement, their children s college, their own savings, etc.). Sure, the accounts are tax-free, but they re a way to force us to pay even more for our healthcare than we already do.Neither McConnell nor Ryan will be happy with their own turning against them on something they and their handlers insist must be done now, and fuck the people who will end up as collateral damage while they dicker over a full replacement plan. But it s true that if Corker, Paul and Alexander block the repeal bill because there s no replacement to go with it, then the effort fails.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images',\n",
       " 'Immigration officers called the New York City Police Department for backup after a group of local residents surrounded them in an apparent attempt to interfere with the arrest of a criminal alien. [Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO) officers working in Queens arrested    Hardat Sampat. The Guyanese national is accused of burglary and illegal   after removal, according to a report by the New York Daily News. As officers took the foreign national into custody, his wife began to plead for his arrest, attracting the attention of others nearby.  More than 30 local residents surrounded the officers and began shouting at them, attempting to stop the arrest. Officers called New York police officers to assist them controlling the crowd. The sanctuary New York City Department of Correction (NYCDOC) released Sampat from custody despite an immigration detainer being put in place by U. S. Immigration and Customs (ICE) officials, according to an official ICE statement reported by PIX11 News. ICE stated Sampat has multiple pending charges with the Queens County Criminal Court. Sampat had been a passenger in a vehicle when officers began to make the arrest. In an attempt to interfere with the arrest the ICE officers, his wife reportedly moved the car to block traffic, NBC4 New York reported. Responding NYPD officers instructed the driver to move the vehicle and clear the roadway. The driver complied with the police order. ICE officers quickly left the scene with Sampat in custody. Officers transported the Guyanese national to the Manhattan Federal Court for processing, the New York Daily News reported. He is expected to be held at an immigration detention facility in New Jersey, relatives told reporters. Reports indicate Sampat allegedly burglarized the home of a    woman he knew on April 9. He allegedly broke into her home a second time and vandalized the home with white spray paint. ICE officers arrested him as he attempted to go to a court hearing on the cases. Since a February announcement by New York City Police Commissioner James Oâ\\x80\\x99Neill that his officers would no longer cooperate with ICE officials attempt to arrest criminal aliens, the agency has ignored more than 130 immigration detainers and released the criminals onto the streets of New York. This number is as of the April 7 ICE Declined Detainer Outcome Report. The report has since been paused pending adjustments to the data gathering methodology. Late last week, ICE officers arrested a registered sex offender the NYCDOC released, despite an immigration detainer issued by ERO officers, Breitbart Texas reported. â\\x80\\x9cIt is unfortunate that we continue to arrest convicted criminals off the street simply because the city refuses to honor detainers and releases them back into our communities,â\\x80\\x9d New York ERO Field Officer Director Thomas R. Decker said. â\\x80\\x9cEach time an officer is forced to pick up someone who could have safely been turned over it puts the officersâ\\x80\\x99 safety, as well as the safety of the neighborhoods we serve, at risk.

       " 'Hillary Clinton delivered an amazing speech on Thursday night and the DNC Convention was a unifying success, so of course Donald Trump threw a temper tantrum about it. Our country s motto is e pluribus unum: out of many, we are one. Will we stay true to that motto?  the former Secretary of State asked Americans before going after Donald Trump s agenda of fear and division. Well, we heard Donald Trump s answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us   from the rest of the world, and from each other.He s betting that the perils of today s world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He s taken the Republican Party a long way  from  Morning in America  to  Midnight in America.  He wants us to fear the future and fear each other.Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than eighty years ago, during a much more perilous time.  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Hillary went on to slam Trump for claiming that he alone can fix America and blasted him for claiming that he will put America first, which led to one of the best passages of the night. He also talks a big game about putting America First. Please explain to me what part of America First leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again   well, he could start by actually making things in America again. The Democratic nominee also questioned Trump s temperament to be president, which also led to one of the best lines of the night. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he s gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he s challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. Indeed, and Trump not only lost his cool during Clinton s speech, he clearly went to bed enraged because he continued throwing a temper tantrum on Friday morning with a series of tweets attacking just about anyone, including the media, Michael Bloomberg, and General John Allen. But he began his temper tantrum on Thursday night by whining about Hillary not saying certain magic words that Trump believes will defeat ISIS.Hillary s refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.  Donald J.

How will he lead the nation when is he is too busy lashing out on Twitter at anyone who makes even the slightest criticism against him? And keep in mind that Trump only has Twitter to attack people with. As president, he would have the military, drones, and nuclear weapons at his disposal.

       " \"ROME/TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Italy wants Libya s coastguard to take responsibility within three years for intercepting migrants across about a tenth of the Mediterranean even as Libyan crews struggle to patrol their own coast and are accused of making deadly mistakes at sea. Six years after the revolution that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi, Libya is split between rival governments in the east and west while ports and beaches are largely in the hands of armed groups. For a graphic on Italy's handover of sea rescues to Libya, click tmsnrt.rs/2o1wLC6 Migrant smuggling has flourished, with more than 600,000 making the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean in four years. Migrants transiting through Libya often endure appalling conditions, including rape, torture and forced labor.   The Italian plan, outlined in a slide presentation seen by Reuters, shows that Italy and the European Union are focusing on rebuilding Libya s navy and coastguard so they can stop boats. But aid groups say the Libyans are poorly trained and accuse them of mishandling a rescue last month in which some 50 people are thought to have died.  The Libyans return all migrants, including refugees, to Libya even though the situation on the ground there is far from resolved. Italy has been coordinating rescues off the Libyan coast since 2013.   The 30 slides show spending of 44 million euros ($52 million) to expand Libya s capacity by 2020, equipping the coastguard and enabling it to establish its own rescue coordination center as well as a vast maritime search-and-rescue region. It also foresees a pilot project for monitoring Libya s southern border. The project draws on European Union and Italian funds, and needs EU approval.   The plan was presented by the Italian coastguard at a conference hosted by the EU s anti-trafficking mission, Sophia, in Rome last month. Representatives from the EU, non-governmental groups and various Mediterranean navies and coastguards attended the closed-door presentation, said a source who was present. Libya s coastguard has already been pushing further into international waters, often firing warning shots or speeding close to charity boats. Over the summer, three charities abandoned rescue operations in part because of fears of the increasing Libyan sea presence. Arrivals to Italy have fallen by two-thirds since July from the same period last year after officials working for the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, Italy s partner, persuaded human smugglers in the city of Sabratha to stop boats leaving.  The Libyan coastguard also increased the rate of its interceptions, turning back about 20,000 this year, though it still only stops a portion of the boats.  The crisis remains a major issue in Italy. State shelters for asylum seekers are nearly full, and with elections looming politicians across the spectrum insist the flows from North Africa be stopped, which the new scheme is likely to address. Italy s coastguard did not reply to a request for comment. The prime minister s office referred questions to the interior ministry, which is spearheading the effort to fight people smuggling in Libya and also had no comment.   Each nation has the right to declare its own search-and-rescue zone, and to carry out search-and-rescue operations,  a Defence Ministry spokesman said, citing international law.  Ayoub Qassem, a Libyan coastguard spokesman, said he did not have details of the plan, but both sides recognized the need to cooperate in tackling irregular migration.    Recently the Italian side has been eager to cooperate with Libya because it s more effective than working without Libya   that s natural,  he said.   Italy has supplied Libya with four refurbished vessels so far, and six more have been promised, while the EU has trained about 220 Libyan coastguards. But rights groups and aid workers say partnering with Libya s  unprofessional  coastguard risks exposing migrants to drowning during rescues or to further rights abuses if sent back to detention centers inside Libya.    From the testimony we hear from the migrants, we know that people intercepted at sea have then re-entered the circle of violence and imprisonment and abuse that they were fleeing,  said Nicola Stalla, search-and-rescue chief for SOS Mediterranee, one of the charities still operating off Libya.   Activists also point to incidents such as one on Nov. 6, when crew members of the German humanitarian ship Sea Watch 3 witnessed a Libyan naval vessel draw alongside an inflatable migrant boat.   When people fell into the water, Sea Watch used small rubber speedboats to pull people from the water while the Libyans looked on. Some migrants who climbed on board the Libyan vessel were whipped with ropes, and the Libyan boat sped off with a man still dangling in the water, according to videos shot by Sea Watch and crew member Gennaro Giudetti, who pulled the body of a lifeless 2 1/2-year-old Nigerian boy named Great from the water.     They watched us and shot videos. They even threw potatoes at us. That s not how you save lives,  said Giudetti.    Libya s naval coastguard accused Sea Watch of obstructing the rescue and trying to lure away migrants who had already boarded their ship. Some migrants jumped into the water to try to reach Sea Watch rescuers.   The Libyans said their smaller speedboats, which are mounted on larger patrol vessels and are the safest to use for rescues, were broken.    We have only one or two of these boats and they do not work, so how we can put them into the water?  Qassem, the  coastguard spokesman, told Reuters.  The expansion of Libyan patrols has led to confusion and competition over who should take the lead during rescues. Some charity ships say they have been directed to hold off rescues to allow the Libyans to arrive, putting migrants at risk.   Libya s search-and-rescue region extends 90 miles from shore in some places, and 200 miles in others, Qassem said.   This summer the Libyans notified the International Maritime Organization about plans to take over a large search and rescue region, but withdrew the notification this month, saying it would resubmit a new one soon, an IMO spokeswoman said.   It would be the first time Libya has set up a search-and-rescue region, she said.   The Italian plan proposes helping Libya formally declare such a zone. It would also provide for training, maintenance, new cars, ambulances and buses, communications equipment and clothing.  Full operation capability  is seen by the end of 2020. \",\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - China has invited U.S. President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to visit Beijing later this year, a White House official said on Tuesday. Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s overture appeared aimed at deepening engagement with the influential young couple, who played a role in the first summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in April, which set an improved tone for relations between the worldâ\\x80\\x99s two biggest economies. Kushner, a senior adviser who entered the White House with no government experience, has been assigned the job of conducting Middle East peace diplomacy and will visit the region this week for talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Helping to manage relations with China is another part of his foreign policy portfolio. At the same time, Kushner has come under heavy scrutiny, with high-profile investigations into alleged contacts between current and former Trump aides and Russian officials. No further details were available on the Chinese invitation, which was first reported by Bloomberg News and confirmed by a White House official on condition of anonymity. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he had seen reports of the visit but that he was not aware of any details.  Trump railed against China, especially its trade practices, during the presidential campaign. A fence-mending phone call in February was arranged by Kushner and Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s U.S. ambassador, Cui Tiankai, U.S. officials said, after Cui invited Ivanka Trump to the Chinese embassyâ\\x80\\x99s Lunar New Year reception, where her daughter sang in Mandarin. Kushner helped plan and attended the U.S.-China summit at Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Mar-a-Lago resort in April. Trump has since had warm words for Xi, praising him for cooperation with efforts to rein in Beijingâ\\x80\\x99s nuclear-armed neighbor North Korea. But analysts question how long rapprochement can last if North Korea continues its nuclear and missile development in defiance of international pressure. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Native American tribe in Montana and a coalition of conservation groups sued the Trump administration on Wednesday for lifting a moratorium on coal leases on public land without consulting tribal leaders and conducting a full environmental review. â\\x80\\x9cIt is alarming and unacceptable for the United States, which has a solemn obligation as the Northern Cheyenneâ\\x80\\x99s trustee, to sign up for many decades of harmful coal mining near and around our homeland without first consulting with our Nation,â\\x80\\x9d Tribal Council Chairman and President Jace Killsback said in a statement. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe in southern Montana said the administration had lifted the moratorium without hearing the tribeâ\\x80\\x99s concerns about the coal-leasing programâ\\x80\\x99s impact on its members and lands. The tribe sent a letter earlier this month to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke requesting a meeting to discuss the issue. Zinke did not respond, and signed the order lifting the moratorium on Tuesday. In a press call on Wednesday, Zinke did not respond to a query about the Northern Cheyenne lawsuit. Killsback said the tribe, which filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Great Falls, would be harmed by lifting the ban. â\\x80\\x9cThe Northern Cheyenne rarely shares in the economic benefits to the region generated by coal industry and other energy development projects,â\\x80\\x9d he said.  About 426 million tons of federal coal are located near the Northern Cheyenne Reservation at the Decker and Spring Creek mines in Montana, the tribe said. However, neighboring tribe, the Crow, relies on coal production as its predominant industry and has called for the relaxation of coal regulations for years. â\\x80\\x9cA war on coal is a war on the Crow people,â\\x80\\x9d Zinke said on the call. Legal group Earthjustice argued that lifting the coal moratorium imperils public health for the benefit of coal companies. â\\x80\\x9cNo one voted to pollute our public lands, air or drinking water in the last election, yet the Trump administration is doing the bidding of powerful polluters as nearly its first order of business,â\\x80\\x9d Earthjustice attorney Jenny Harbine said in a statement. The legal filing said that undoing the moratorium violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires a full environmental review prior to major policy changes. ',\n",

       " 'Prince, the music icon who struggled with debilitating hip pain during his career, died from an accidental overdose of   fentanyl, a type of synthetic opiate, officials in Minnesota said Thursday. The news ended weeks of speculation about the sudden death of the musician, who had a reputation for clean living but who appears to have developed a dependency on medications to treat his pain. Authorities have yet to discuss how he came to be in possession of the fentanyl and whether it had been prescribed by a doctor. Officials had waited several weeks for the results of a toxicology test undertaken as part of an autopsy performed after he was found dead April 21 in an elevator at his estate. He was preparing to enroll in an opioid treatment program when he died at 57, according to the lawyer for a doctor who was planning to treat him. The Midwest Medical Examinerâ\\x80\\x99s Office, which conducted the autopsy, declined to comment beyond releasing a copy of its findings. The Carver County Sheriffâ\\x80\\x99s Office is continuing to investigate the death with help from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. The sheriffâ\\x80\\x99s office had said it was looking into whether opioid abuse was a factor, and a law enforcement official had said that painkillers were found on Prince when investigators arrived. â\\x80\\x9cThe M. E. report is one piece of the whole thing,â\\x80\\x9d said Jason Kamerud, the countyâ\\x80\\x99s chief deputy sheriff. Fentanyl is a potent but dangerous painkiller, estimated to be more than 50 times more powerful than heroin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report did not list how much fentanyl was found in Princeâ\\x80\\x99s blood. Last year, federal officials issued an alert that said incidents and overdoses with fentanyl were â\\x80\\x9coccurring at an alarming rate throughout the United States. â\\x80\\x9d Weeks before his death, Prince postponed a concert in Atlanta, saying that he had the flu. A week later, he made up the show, but on the flight home to Minneapolis, he fell unconscious and his private jet made an emergency landing in Moline, Ill. There, emergency medical personnel treated him with Narcan, a drug typically used to counteract the effects of an opioid overdose, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the matter. Prince told his friends and associates after that emergency that he was O. K. His publicist said he had the flu and that this was what had led to the emergency landing. But a concerned friend later reached out to a   doctor who specializes in treating opioid addictions, in hopes of getting him into treatment, according to William Mauzy, a lawyer for the doctor, Howard Kornfeld. On April 20, Dr. Kornfeld sent his son, Andrew Kornfeld, who is not a doctor but works at his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s clinic, on a   flight to Princeâ\\x80\\x99s Paisley Park estate in Chanhassen, Minn. Mr. Mauzy said. But when Andrew Kornfeld arrived on the morning of April 21, he and two members of Princeâ\\x80\\x99s staff found the singer lifeless. He then called 911. Andrew Kornfeld was carrying a drug used to treat opioid addiction, but Mr. Mauzy said he hoped his client, who was not authorized to dispense medications, would not be charged with any crime, in part because of a good Samaritan law that allows people to call 911 to get someone help without worrying about criminal consequences. Mr. Mauzy said neither Kornfeld had given Prince any medication. The medical examinerâ\\x80\\x99s report listed Prince, who was    as weighing 112 pounds and said he had been dressed all in black that morning, including a black cap. His death came at a time when an opioid addiction epidemic has been sweeping the United States. Studies showed that more than 28, 000 people died from opioids, which includes heroin and painkillers, in 2014, and 4. 3 million people were taking pain medication for nonmedical purposes that year. Fentanyl can be consumed in a variety of ways, including through patches, injections, smoking and a lollipop. It is unclear what method Prince used. Dr. Torin Finver, an addiction medicine specialist at the Jacobs School of Medicine at the University at Buffalo, said it can be easier to overdose on the drug because its effects last shorter than they do for other opiates, thus leading users to dose more frequently and possibly consume too much. The illicit shipment of fentanyl into the United States has become a major concern for federal officials, who say the substance has become an increasingly popular product of drug cartels in Mexico and is often mixed with heroin. Princeâ\\x80\\x99s body was worn down from decades of taxing performances, in which he often did splits or jumped from heights in platform shoes, several people close to him said. One person who knew him said that Prince had hip surgery in the   but it did not completely alleviate his pain. The medical examinerâ\\x80\\x99s report noted a scar on Princeâ\\x80\\x99s left hip as well as one on his lower right leg. To some of Princeâ\\x80\\x99s closest friends and colleagues, his struggle with pain medication came as a surprise because the musician had become a Jehovahâ\\x80\\x99s Witness and strove, friends said, to live such a clean life. He was averse to drinking alcohol and frowned on the use of recreational drugs.

       " 'Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones isn t known for having a solid grasp of the truth. He takes ordinary news items and turns them into something completely bizarre, and he promotes things that have already been changed into something completely bizarre. Such was his involvement in perpetuating the lie that Comet Ping Pong, in D.C., was the site of a massive child trafficking operation involving Hillary Clinton.Now that that conspiracy theory has led to near-tragedy, Jones seems to be desperately trying to scrub any evidence he might have influenced Edgar Maddison Welch to fire his assault rifle in the restaurant in an insane attempt to investigate the place, and free the children allegedly being kept there. He thought he was doing a public service based in part on what Jones had been saying on the matter.Instead, he put innocent customers and restaurant staff in danger because he believed a conspiracy theory that Jones actively and openly promoted.The criminal complaint against Welch actually mentions a video carrying a headline from InfoWars called,  Watch PIZZAGATE: The Bigger Picture,  which Welch sent to a friend on Dec. 1. He had been watching YouTube videos in an attempt to research Pizzagate and he said it was  making him sick,  because why try and actually look for the truth when you d rather believe in conspiracy nonsense?Alex Jones  site, InfoWars, heavily promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. Jones posted a video called  Pizzagate is Real: Something Is Going On, But What?  to his YouTube channel in late November, but now that video has been  removed by the user,  although nobody really knows when that happened.Jones has also deleted the video from his Facebook account, and InfoWars deleted an article that promoted Jones  Pizzagate video. Some things remain, but who knows for how long. It certainly seems like Jones wants to at least look innocent in the whole thing. When you peddle baseless conspiracy theories, though, this is what can happen. Jones needs to own up to his part in this near-tragedy.Featured image by Ben Jackson via Getty Images for SiriusXM',\n",

       " 'PARIS/SEOUL (Reuters) - Franceâ\\x80\\x99s Winter Olympics team will not travel to the 2018 Games in South Korea if its security cannot be guaranteed, Franceâ\\x80\\x99s sports minister said on Thursday, the first major doubts by a participating nation about growing North Korean tensions. The games organizer said on Friday that it is closely monitoring the current geopolitical situation with the South Korean government, adding that safety is the top priority. Tensions in the region have escalated since North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3, prompting global condemnation. North Koreaâ\\x80\\x99s leader Kim Jong Un said on Friday the North will consider the â\\x80\\x9chighest level of hard-line countermeasure in historyâ\\x80\\x9d against the United States in response to U.S. President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s threat to destroy the North. Franceâ\\x80\\x99s Sports Minister Laura Flessel told RTL radio that if the crisis deepened and â\\x80\\x9cour security cannot be assured, the French Olympics team will stay at home.â\\x80\\x9d  But she added: â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re not there yet.â\\x80\\x9d Participants in the Games - the first Winter Olympics hosted by an Asian nation outside Japan - had not previously raised safety concerns publicly. The games are scheduled for Feb 9-25 next year in Pyeongchang, just 80 km (50 miles) from the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, the worldâ\\x80\\x99s most heavily armed border. The two countries remain technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. â\\x80\\x9cSafety and security is one of the most important aspects of Games preparations,â\\x80\\x9d Sung Baik-you, a spokesman for the organizing committee, said in a statement to Reuters on Friday. South Koreaâ\\x80\\x99s President Moon Jae-in said on Wednesday the country is pushing to ensure security at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. In a meeting with International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach, Moon said South Korea is well aware of the concerns. The Japanese Olympic Committee said on Friday it is not considering the cancellation of its plans. â\\x80\\x9cWe will continue to prepare in the same way as with other international competitions that we take part in,â\\x80\\x9d a spokeswoman for the committee said. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) said it was working with all the relevant authorities to ensure its athletes would be safe. â\\x80\\x9cEach host city presents a unique challenge from a security perspective, and, as is always the case, we are working with the organizers, the U.S. State Department and the relevant law enforcement agencies to ensure that our athletes, and our entire delegation, are safe,â\\x80\\x9d USOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky said. The Chinese Olympic Committee said it had no immediate comment. The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC), which has representatives in South Korea, said the safety of its team was always its main priority. â\\x80\\x9cThe safety of our entire Canadian Olympic Team is always our main priority, no matter where the Games are held,â\\x80\\x9d the COC said in a statement emailed to Reuters. â\\x80\\x9cThe Government of Canada does not currently have travel advisories in place for South Korea and recommends that Canadians exercise normal security precautions, which is the lowest of four risk levels.â\\x80\\x9d Australia, one of Asiaâ\\x80\\x99s largest participants at recent Winter Games, is monitoring the situation. â\\x80\\x9cThe safety of our team is of the highest priority but we are comfortable with the priority that the (International Olympic Committee) and the Org Comm are placing on security and safety of the Games and its participants,â\\x80\\x9d the Australian Olympic Committee said in a statement emailed to Reuters. â\\x80\\x9cWe are relying on advice from DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) and working with the Korean Ambassador and if their advice changes, we will advise our team accordingly but for the moment there is no suggestion that the Games will not go ahead or their safety is compromised.â\\x80\\x9d The chief of the International Ski Federation, Gian-Franco Kasper, dismissed any fears among athletes, saying the Pyeongchang Olympics would be the â\\x80\\x9csafest in the worldâ\\x80\\x9d. He conceded, however, that ticket sales among overseas visitors could be affected. The IOC has said it is not contemplating any â\\x80\\x98Plan Bâ\\x80\\x99 for the Games.  IOC President Thomas Bach said last week that considering any scenario other than holding the Olympics in South Korea could hamper diplomatic efforts. ',\n",
       " 'This column has been updated.\\n\\nYou think John Boehner had a rocky time as speaker of the House? Just wait until you see how his successor fares this fall â\\x80\\x94 if House Republicans can even find a successor.\\n\\nThe same conservatives who badgered Boehner into retirement wasted no time in ousting his hand-picked successor, Kevin McCarthy.\\n\\nConservatives had been grumbling about McCarthy as the speaker-apparent almost from the moment Boehner announced his retirement, and by the eve of Thursday\\'s House GOP vote to name a Boehner replacement, the criticism of McCarthy was murderous.\\n\\nRep. Tom Massie (Ky.) declared at a luncheon with reporters Wednesday that \"there is absolutely no way that I think you can vote for McCarthy and go back home and tell your constituents you did the best thing for them.\"\\n\\nRep. RaÃºl Labrador (Idaho) had questions about whether McCarthy \"is prepared for such a high office.\"\\n\\nAnd Rep. Tim Huelskamp (Kan.) let it be known that \"outside conservative groups are not comfortable at all with picking Boehner\\'s right-hand man to take the speaker\\'s spot.\"\\n\\nOn the eve of Thursday\\'s vote, the conservative Freedom Caucus announced that its few dozen members would vote en bloc against McCarthy. He had enough votes to prevail in the caucus election on Thursday, but unless he could win over the conservative holdouts, he wouldn\\'t prevail in speaker elections that had been set for Oct. 29.\\n\\nAnd so, at noon on Thursday, the time the leadership election was to occur, McCarthy withdrew from the race.\\n\\nMcCarthy\\'s surrender is surprising, but nothing changes. It doesn\\'t really matter who the next speaker is, because that person will be leader in title only. Conservatives, far from being placated by Boehner\\'s ouster, are emboldened: They have plans to bend the entire House to their will.\\n\\nDefaulting on the federal debt? Not a problem. Shutting the government to defund Planned Parenthood? So be it.\\n\\nThese were a couple of the take-aways from Wednesday\\'s installment of \"Conversations with Conservatives,\" a monthly luncheon sponsored by the Heritage Foundation (parent company of the House GOP caucus) and catered by Chick-Fil-A, the fast-food chain owned by religious conservatives. The 10 men on the dais, members of the Freedom Caucus, the Republican Study Committee, the Tea Party Caucus and other conservative factions, might be considered the politburo of the new conservative order in the House.\\n\\n\"The marginalizing of conservatives that\\'s taken place over the last nine months is just not going to be tolerated anymore,\" declared Rep. Andy Harris (Md.).\\n\\n\"We have an opportunity to completely change what\\'s happening,\" announced Labrador.\\n\\nTo seize this \"opportunity,\" they presented the three contenders for the speakership â\\x80\\x94 McCarthy, Jason Chaffetz and Daniel Webster â\\x80\\x94 with a list of demands that would increase the (already deafening) voice of conservatives in the House.\\n\\nThere may only be a few dozen die-hard conservatives in the caucus, but, as Boehner and McCarthy have learned, if they withhold their votes, they deny Republican leaders a majority. Any would-be speaker, therefore, had better do what conservatives want â\\x80\\x94 and that includes likely showdowns over a debt-ceiling increase, an omnibus spending bill, a transportation bill and Export-Import Bank legislation.\\n\\nBeyond that, the conservatives demand that the speaker never punish them for voting against the caucus; let them amend legislation on the floor at will; never let bills come to the floor without the support of a majority of Republicans; and refuse to take up Senate-brokered compromises.\\n\\nThat would lead to shutdown and default in short order. But this did not seem to be a major concern over lunch. Labrador, mocking GOP leaders\\' claims that \"we can\\'t shut down the government,\" said he would prefer a leader who would be willing to fight â\\x80\\x94 \"even if we fail.\"\\n\\nPaul Singer of USA Today observed that the conservatives\\' description of leadership is more like followership. \"You\\'re asking for a speaker,\" he said, who \"follows your lead.\"\\n\\nThey did not dispute this notion. Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) said that \"we want a process-focused speaker,\" while Rep. John Fleming (La.) said the goal is to give \"power to the individual members\" so that the speaker no longer is \"dictating the agenda.\"\\n\\nThen why doesn\\'t one of the conservative hard-liners run for the speakership himself?\\n\\nLabrador\\'s answer was revealing. \"When you\\'re leading the revolution, you also upset a lot of people,\" he said. \"It\\'s very difficult to make change as we have been trying to make and also build a coalition.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s true. It\\'s harder to build a coalition than to tear things apart. And this is why the next speaker â\\x80\\x94 whoever it is â\\x80\\x94 will be no match for emboldened conservatives hell-bent on destruction.\\n\\nRead more from Dana Milbankâ\\x80\\x99s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.',\n",
       " \"Donald Trump has watched from the stage as his rabid supporters have brutally assaulted the people who come out to protest him. Oftentimes, he even urges them on   whipping his followers into a violent frenzy with unfounded accusations that the protesters are working for ISIS or were sent by Bernie Sanders and  deserve it. After this week saw nearly every Trump rally end in assaults and racial and ethnic slurs, the question turned from  Will someone be killed at a Trump rally?  to  When? Trump has done absolutely nothing to tone down the rhetoric. In fact, he s stepped it up. Lately, he s begun using his supporters as a personal goon squad. When he accused Bernie Sanders fans of forcing him to cancel his rally in Chicago, he threatened to  send them  out to harass Sanders supporters. The supporters themselves seem downright eager to oblige this call to violence. The only thing missing are literal brown shirts.This again came to a head, this time in North Carolina, where Trump rallies in Concord and Fayetteville. In one disturbing, but not uncommon, incident, a black man was attacked as the crowd roared. A cowboy hat-wearing Trump superfan beamed as he told reporters that he was proud for sucker punching an African American protester as he was being escorted out. He was eventually charged with assault, but not before vowing to  kill  the man if he ever saw him again.Trump doubled-down on his claim that these protesters were  bad people  and possibly ISIS terrorists. He then encouraged his followers to be more violent when faced with protesters, again saying they were  bad  and deserved it. His supporters in the media also parroted this call to violence.I would like to see a little more violence from the innocent Trump supporters set upon by violent leftist hoodlums.  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 13, 2016But North Carolina authorities are now coming out strongly against Trump attempting to turn their state into a breeding ground for fascism. Following the violent rally, the Cumberland County Sheriff s Office announced that it would be looking into charging Donald Trump   the current Republican front-runner for President of the United States by a wide margin  with inciting a riot.JUST IN: North Carolina police considering filing charges against Trump for potentially inciting a riot https://t.co/gQjG8N6tXP  MSNBC (@MSNBC) March 14, 2016A look at North Carolina s law against inciting a riot shows that Trump appears to check all the boxes. It s a wonder he hasn t been charged yet.Here's North Carolina riot law. pic.twitter.com/z9KpRPhcwH  Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) March 14, 2016For the protesters who brave a Trump rally, the fact that the man on stage is using a microphone to actually call for the thousands of supporters in attendance to verbally or physically attack him or her, the  clear and present  danger is real. And this isn t just a thought exercise. People have been repeatedly hurt trying to escape the events. One man was pushed down and kicked. Another was elbowed in the face. Even reporters have faced violence. A TIME photographer was choke-slammed by Trump s Secret Service agent. A former Breitbart reporter was thrown to the ground by Trump s campaign manager, leaving bruises on her arm from where he grabbed her. The list goes on When Trump comes to town, you can count on two things happening: The racists crawling out of the woodwork waving Trump flags and violence directed at the people who oppose Trump. That s not a way to run a democracy. If authorities don t begin to stand up to Trump s calls for violence with criminal charges, the chances of a deadly incident happening are nearly total.The authorities in North Carolina caution that they may not charge Trump, however. Unfortunately,  inciting a riot  is known in legal circles as being notoriously difficult to prove, given how vague its language is. Trump will no doubt respond with an army of lawyers to descend on North Carolina should he find himself charged, so it is clearly making the sheriff s office gun shy. In a statement, they said they were looking into but won t make an official decision until after they ve run down a few more leads.Featured image via WRAL\",\n",

       " 'PARIS (Reuters) - France announced a one-billion-euro plan for universities on Monday, promising to offer more places on popular courses, cut drop-out rates and build more accommodation, in a bid to assuage the concerns of politically powerful students. President Emmanuel Macron s government has already faced down street protests over labour reform and risks more industrial action over plans to reform the pension and unemployment insurance systems. It wants to avoid confrontation with students who have forced past governments into policy u-turns with protracted rallies. The government said the 1 billion euros ($1.16 billion) will be spent over the five years of Macron s term in office.  Students in France who pass high school exams have the right to go to university in their home area. But this has led to popular subjects such as law and psychology being heavily oversubscribed and prompted the introduction of an unpopular lottery system where demand is highest. That lottery system will now be scrapped and the most pressed universities will be allowed to select students on merit. The proposal stops short of a blanket UK-style selection system that student unions had opposed.  France s biggest student union, the moderate Fage, welcomed the plan. Two other unions, including the left-wing Unef, the second largest, were critical. Unef has said it will join CGT-led protests against government reforms on Nov.16 and urged students to  make their voice heard  against the education reform.     Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, has also urged students to mobilise after his early attempts to get workers onto the streets against the easing of unemployment laws failed. Macron  has got the advantage for now, let s not hide it,  Melenchon told franceinfo radio.  If youths got moving, things would be different, but it s not the case for now.  The reforms also include 60,000 new student housing units over the next five years and promise to scrap student s social security contributions and increase tutoring. Only 40 percent of students complete the first year of university, the government said.  Our aim is to ensure equal opportunities,  said University Minister Frederique Vidal.  We want to make university more accessible by accompanying students, in all their diversity.  ',\n",
       " 'Monica Camacho-Perez came to the United States from Mexico as a child, crossing into Arizona with her mother in the same spot where her father made the trip before them. â\\x80\\x9cNobody stopped us,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 Camacho-Perez, now 20, said of her 2002 journey.\\n\\nThree years ago, her uncle tried to cross the border and join the family in Baltimore, where they remain illegal immigrants. He was stopped three times by the U.S. Border Patrol and jailed for 50Â\\xa0days.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want to try anymore,â\\x80\\x9d said Camacho-Perez. â\\x80\\x9cNow, itâ\\x80\\x99s really hard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs the Department of Homeland Security continues to pour money into border security, evidence is emerging that illegal immigration flows have fallen to their lowest level in at least two decades. The nationâ\\x80\\x99s population of illegal immigrants, which more than tripled, to 12.2Â\\xa0million, between 1990 and 2007, has dropped by about 1Â\\xa0million, according to demographers at the Pew Research Center.\\n\\nA key â\\x80\\x94 but largely overlooked â\\x80\\x94 sign of these ebbing flows is the changing makeup of the undocumented population. Until recent years, illegal immigrants tended to be young men streaming across the Southern border in pursuit of work. But demographic data show that the typical illegal immigrant now is much more likely someone who is 35 or older and has lived in the United States for a decade or more.\\n\\nHomeland security officials in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations â\\x80\\x94 who have more than doubled the Border Patrolâ\\x80\\x99s size and spent billions on drones, sensors and other technology at the border â\\x80\\x94 say enhanced security is driving the new trends.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have seen tremendous progress,â\\x80\\x9d said R. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. â\\x80\\x9cThe border is much more secure than in times past.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe issue of border security is central to the broader debate over immigration reform that has roiled Washington in recent years and is emerging as a flash point in the 2016 presidential campaign. Congressional Republicans have insisted on greater border security before they consider legalizing any immigrants who came to this country without proper documents.\\n\\nPresident Obama says the border has never been more secure and is urging a series of legislative steps to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants, streamline the visa system and further fortify the border. He has already moved to protect certain undocumented immigrants from deportation through executive actions. But these actions have faced resistance in the courts, including the decision Tuesday by a federal appeals court to keep one of the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s signature immigration efforts from moving ahead.\\n\\nWhatâ\\x80\\x99s increasingly clear is that the shifting fortunes of the U.S. economy account for less of the ebb and flow of illegal immigration. Even as the economy bounces back from recession, illegal immigration flows, especially from Mexico, have kept declining, Â\\xadaccording to researchers and government data. Since the 1990s, the opposite was true: The better the economy, the more people tried to come.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEvery month or quarter that the economy continues to improve and unauthorized immigration doesnâ\\x80\\x99t pick up supports the theory that border security is a bigger factor, and itâ\\x80\\x99s less about the economy and we have moved into a new era,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 said Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the U.S. immigration program at the Migration Policy Institute.\\n\\nSome researchers say factors other than security are playing a role and might even account for much of the reduced flow of illegal immigrants. These researchers point, for instance, to changes in Latin America that could be pushing fewer people to seek a better life in the United States.\\n\\nAt odds with the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s claims of success, a series of academic studies in recent years have found little linkage between border security and illegal migration.\\n\\nDouglas S. Massey, a Princeton University sociologist, said the falling numbers of immigrants have â\\x80\\x9cnothing to do with border enforcement.â\\x80\\x9d Massey, who helps run a project that has interviewed thousands of illegal Mexican migrants over the past three decades, attributed the trend to demographic changes in Mexico, such as women having fewer children.\\n\\nBut even some researchers who are skeptical about the overall effectiveness of enhanced border security acknowledge indirect effects of these measures. For potential migrants who are calculating the pros and cons of trying to cross the border, stiffer U.S. security measures are making the trip much more expensive, in particular the exploding cost of hiring a guide. The journey has also become more arduous and dangerous, in part because the DHS has plugged traditional crossing points and driven migrants deeper into the desert.\\n\\nSince the Bush administration, the DHS has dramatically increased its efforts to lock down the southwest border. The budget for Customs and Border Protection has grown to $10.7Â\\xa0billion in the past decade, a 75Â\\xa0percent increase. The number of Border Patrol agents at the border has nearly doubled over the past decade, to more than 18,000 today.\\n\\nMuch of the ramp-up occurred during the Bush administration, but the Obama administration has marshaled more forces as well. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has recently set up three task forces to increase coordination within the DHS.\\n\\nCurrent and former DHS officials acknowledge that a confluence of factors explains the decline in illegal migration, including demographic changes in Mexico, improvements in its economy and Mexicoâ\\x80\\x99s crackdown on Central American migrants headed to the United States. But these officials insist that the massive investment to secure the border has been the key factor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt used to be that you could literally sit at a bar in Tijuana, Mexico, look across the border into San Diego, wait for the Border Patrol to drive in the other direction and make a run for it,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 said Steve Atkiss, a former CBP chief of staff and now a partner at Command Consulting Group. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s much more difficult and expensive now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMadai Ledezma crossed the Mexican border into Texas a decade ago at age 23 and remains in the United States as an illegal immigrant. She said her uncle and brother had recently wanted to join her. But, she said, theyâ\\x80\\x99re staying put after her uncle was caught by the Border Patrol a year ago and locked up for a month before being sent back to Mexico.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe risk of crossing again is that he will be locked up again,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 Ledezma said. She added, â\\x80\\x9cI just heard recently that the Border Patrol now has the ability to fire their weapons.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLedezmaâ\\x80\\x99s uncle was one of a shrinking number of undocumented immigrants stopped by the Border Patrol. Government officials widely cite that trend as evidence that the overall flow is also down.\\n\\nIn 2000, considered the peak of the flood of illegal Mexican migration, more than 1.6Â\\xa0million people were apprehended, according to DHS data. Those numbers have plunged to around 400,000 per year since 2012 and are down 28Â\\xa0percent in the first part of fiscal 2015 compared with last year. Even last yearâ\\x80\\x99s widely publicized spike in unaccompanied minors crossing the border from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras has receded dramatically, the data show.\\n\\nWhile the declining number of apprehensions is not conclusive proof that illegal immigration is down, other less publicized research strongly suggests this is the case.\\n\\nWayne Cornelius, director of the Mexican migration field research program at the University of California at San Diego, interviews hundreds of people each year in the Mexican state of YucaÂ\\xadtan and asks them whether they are planning to come to the United States in the next 12Â\\xa0months.\\n\\nIn 2006, 24Â\\xa0percent said yes. By 2009, as the U.S. economy was cratering, 8Â\\xa0percent said yes. This year, 2.5Â\\xa0percent answered in the affirmative.\\n\\nA recent study by the Pew Research Center, meanwhile, found that the median length of stay for illegal immigrants in the United States jumped from less than eight years in 2003 to nearly 13 years by 2013. Their median age has increased from 28 during the 1990s to nearly 36 today.\\n\\nThose figures wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be possible if young men were still coming across the border in huge numbers, and it was those young men who accounted for most of the illegal traffic.\\n\\nBut Massey, the Princeton researcher, highlighted an unintended consequence of the security crackdown on the border. He said immigrants who are already in the United States are afraid to go back and forth to Mexico as they traditionally did, and are â\\x80\\x9caging in placeâ\\x80\\x9d in the United States.\\n\\nLedezmaâ\\x80\\x99s tale is a common one. Over the past decade, she and her husband, Jose Pina, a landscaper, have become involved in their community in New Carrollton. Their daughter, Heather, 6, is a U.S. citizen. Ledezma volunteers at Heatherâ\\x80\\x99s school, reads with her at the public library and attends a local church.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAfter so many years of living here, I of course consider this my home,â\\x80\\x9d she said.\\n\\nAccording to estimates by the Migration Policy Institute, about a third of illegal immigrants own a home and have children who are U.S. citizens.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have this population here and they havenâ\\x80\\x99t left and they donâ\\x80\\x99t appear to be going back and forth to Mexico anymore,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 said George Escobar, senior director of human services for CASA, a Â\\xadMaryland-based immigrant advocacy group. â\\x80\\x9cThese trends have reshaped the immigration debate right before our eyes.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Terry Branstad said he would prefer to serve Iowa beef   not cuts from Australia   at the U.S. Embassy there.He won t get that wish yet, but the prime rib he slices into Friday when joined in Beijing by U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Chinese government officials to ceremonially mark the return of U.S. beef to China after a 14-year ban will be from closer to home   Nebraska.The meat shipped last week by a South Omaha meatpacker was reported to be the first shipment of U.S. beef to China since 2003 after officials sealed a long-sought trade deal this month. This is a big deal. It s definitely very positive news,  said Lee Schulz, an Iowa State University Extension livestock economist.But Schulz cautioned overcoming the political hurdles that had prevented U.S. beef exports to China over fears associated with mad cow disease are only the first step. It will be some time before American beef becomes  it s what s for dinner  for nearly 1.4 billion Chinese.He described the Chinese market for U.S. beef as  in its infancy  in terms of its impact on Iowa and U.S. producers and processors.The market today is  very different  from 2003, according to Chris Freland, executive director of the Iowa Beef Industry Council. Still, what she saw while visiting China earlier this year makes her believe U.S. beef producers have  an exciting opportunity  to move into the Chinese market. There are a lot of people there   and a rising middle class who can add beef to their diet,  she said.China is projected to become the largest beef market in the world and a major destination for U.S. beef products, according to American Farm Bureau Federation economist Katelyn McCullock. Adding to the market potential is China s changing taste, McCullock said.In 2003, much of the market there was offal   tongues, kidneys and livers, for example. Today, there has been demand for higher-value  muscle cuts  or steak.Before China closed the door on U.S. beef, it imported $70 million worth of beef annually, with the United States supplying 80 percent of that. Today, China imports about $2.6 billion worth of beef every year. Last year, Chinese beef imports totaled 601,000 tons and demand is expected to increase ninefold in four years. So if we can even have a portion of that coming back for Iowa producers, that s a celebration for producer profitability,  Freland said.For entire story: The Gazette ',\n",
       " 'UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council on Thursday approved the creation of a U.N. investigative team to collect, preserve and store evidence in Iraq of acts by Islamic State that may be war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. The 15-member council unanimously adopted a British-drafted resolution, after a year of negotiations with Iraq, that asks Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to establish a team  to support domestic efforts  to hold the militants accountable. British Minister of State for the Middle East Alistair Burt said Britain would provide some $1.3 million to help establish the team.  There can never be adequate recompense for those who were forced to endure the wanton brutality of (Islamic State) and the dead will not be brought back, but this resolution means that the international community is united in our belief that there should, at least, be accountability,  Burt told the council. Use of the evidence collected by the team in other venues, such as international courts, would  be determined in agreement with the Government of Iraq on a case-by-case basis.  Evidence is for primary use by Iraqi authorities, followed by  competent national-level courts,  according to the resolution. Thousands of foreigners have fought with Islamic State and some are already being prosecuted when they return home.  U.N. experts said in June last year that Islamic State was committing genocide against the Yazidis in Syria and Iraq to destroy the minority religious community through killings, sexual slavery and other crimes. International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney and Nadia Murad, a young Yazidi woman who was enslaved and raped by Islamic State fighters in Mosul, have long pushed Iraq to allow U.N. investigators to help. Clooney and Murad, who were both in the Security Council for Thursday s vote, described the resolution as a milestone in the fight for justice.  Nadia and I exchanged a warm smile when we saw the 15 hands go up in the chamber,  Clooney told Reuters.   It s been a long time coming; in the meantime, evidence has been lost and we ve lost some opportunities along the way, but the fact that we have this resolution now means that justice is finally possible,  she said. Murad said she was  very happy  the council had acted.  The Security Council met during the annual gathering of world leaders for the U.N. General Assembly.  We look ahead to the next steps and it s really the next steps that will define whether this piece of paper we acquired today will become real justice on the ground for Yazidis and other victims of ISIS,  Clooney said. Iraq s foreign minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari officially requested international help in a letter to the Security Council last month. The council could have established an inquiry without Iraq s consent, but Britain wanted Iraq s approval. Islamic State s self-proclaimed caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces completed the recapture of Mosul, the militants  capital in northern Iraq, after a nine-month campaign.

       " 'The latest in a seemingly unending torrent of scandals and toxicity coming from Fox News, the network says it was forced to abruptly fire Bob Beckel after the longtime host of The Five made a  racially insensitive remark  to an African-American Fox News employee. The firing comes just weeks after the conservative channel faced a class-action lawsuit that alleged executives would entertain themselves by forcing black female employees to arm wrestle white employees.Beckel himself had a history with inflammatory, offensive comments. Ostensibly the channel s token  liberal,  Beckel proved himself to be anything but with repeated misogynistic and racist comments. In 2014, Beckel was briefly suspended after using the derogatory term  Chinamen  while bashing the Chinese government.His remarks towards an African-American employee were apparently the final straw: Bob Beckel was terminated today for making an insensitive remark to an African-American employee,  the network said in a statement. Fox News  human-resources department was made aware of a complaint about what one person familiar with the situation characterized as a  racially insensitive remark  on Tuesday evening. Executives conducted an internal investigation, this person said, and decided to part ways with Beckel Friday morning.It may be small consolation to the countless people its hurt over the years, but Fox News is having an exceptionally bad year. Despite their guy winning the election, the network has been plagued by scandals big and small.Worse still, by refusing to cover Trump honestly, the network has seen its ratings plummet. It now consistently loses to rivals CNN and MSNBC in primetime viewers, who tune into the other networks to learn about the Trump scandals Fox refuses to cover.And at this point, it s not entirely clear whether Fox News can ever fully recover from the culture of misogyny and racism that Ailes built. The fact that Beckel is still using racial slurs seems to suggest the problems go much deeper than any one host.UPDATE: The attorneys representing the man verbally harassed by Beckel have come forward with the victim s account of Beckel s behavior. It s bad. Mr. Beckel stormed out of his office when our client, a Black [sic] IT employee came to service his computer, telling our client that he was leaving his office because he is Black,  the attorneys said in a statement. They also allege that when their client went to lodge a complaint against Beckel, Fox News Chief Human Resource Officer Kevin Lord tried to intimidate him and convince him to withdraw the complaint.It appears that even when ultimately deciding to fire Beckel, Fox still behaved with characteristic awfulness.Featured image via Fox News',\n",

The problem is that the deck is stacked in favor of small states, which receive equal representation in the Senate despite dramatic variance in population.

       " 'Although Obama had 3 years to take action to fix the Flint water problem, President Donald Trump has managed to do it in 2 months. The EPA has just issued a $100 million grant to the city of Flint, Michigan to replace the city s corroded and lead-polluted pipes.Critics of President Trump have lambasted him for his proposed budget cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency, saying the cuts are proof that he doesn t care about the environment.EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt released a statement saying,  The people of Flint and all Americans deserve a more responsive federal government  EPA will especially focus on helping Michigan improve Flint s water infrastructure as part of our larger goal of improving America s water infrastructure. Under authority granted the agency by the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016, the EPA just issued a $100 million grant to the beleaguered city of Flint, Michigan, to help in the effort at replacing the city s badly corroded and lead-tainted system of water pipes. We are excited and very grateful to receive these much-needed funds,  Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said.  The City of Flint being awarded a grant of this magnitude in such a critical time of need will be a huge benefit. The state of Michigan also contributed $20 million to match 20 percent of the grant. Meanwhile, CNN continues with their anti-Trump narrative and insists that President Trump had nothing to do with the grant and that it actually came from an action that former President Barack Obama and the prior Congress took in 2016. They are clearly blind to Trump s promise to fix the crumbling infrastructure of our country as soon as possible, something Obama never made a priority.CNN also obsessed over Trump s proposed 31 percent EPA budget cuts, failing to mention that the president had no intention of defunding programs to help improve the water system infrastructure.Despite the fact that Flint has been dealing with contaminated water for three years, Obama s EPA did not attempt to fix the problem. Now that Trump is in office, he is taking real action to make positive changes in the lives of Flint, MI citizens.Source: Conservative Tribune',\n",
       " 'When Henry Adams wrote in the early 20th century that \"politics, as a practice whatever its professions, had always been the systematic organization of hatreds,\" there was ample reason to take him literally.\\n\\nThe world back then was on the verge of a cataclysmic war that would kill 17 million people and help incubate both communism and fascism. Adams had come of age in London as the son of the American ambassador under President Abraham Lincoln, a man who knew all too well how political disputes can turn bloody. And Adams\\' great-grandfather, the second president of the United States, was accused by Thomas Jefferson\\'s supporters during the famously acrimonious 1800 election of having, among many other unpleasant things, a \"hideous hermaphroditical character.\"\\n\\nSo maybe the one positive of the 2016 version of American political hatred is that it probably won\\'t make people work double shifts down at the morgue. But everything else about this repellant contest between the two most reviled major-party nominees in modern history points to an alarming resurgence of that foul and dangerous defect of judgment known as collectivism.\\n\\nWhen we hear the c word nowadays it\\'s usually in the context of Stalin\\'s agricultural five-year plans or the rah-rah slogans on 1930s posters. But there\\'s another, more personal meaning of the term that has dwindled in usage, even while its application to major-party politics seems to ratchet up each cycle. And that is: treating the disparate individuals within any given bloc as sharing a collective set of characteristics, intentions, and pathologies. It\\'s what Hillary Clinton meant with \"basket of deplorables,\" it\\'s what Donald Trump has done with \"Mexican heritage\" and its variants, and it\\'s all too often the nightstick that our friends and loved ones grab for when talking about politics in a presidential year.\\n\\nWhat makes the Democratic version of collective antipathy particularly noxious is the fact that it often comes disguised as a treacly appeal to unity. Trump \"wants to divide us,\" Clinton lamented at the Democratic National Convention. \"We have to heal the divides in our country.â\\x80¦And that starts with listening, listening to each other. Trying, as best we can, to walk in each other\\'s shoes.\"\\n\\nUnless, of course, you have or work with large amounts of money. \"Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes,\" Clinton thundered later in the same speech. \"If companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we\\'ll make them pay us back.\"\\n\\nClinton\\'s vanquished Democratic opponent, the democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, is even more tin-eared about his own hypocrisy. \"This election is about which candidate understands the real problems facing this country and has offered real solutions,\" Sanders said in his convention speech. \"Not just bombast, not just fearmongering, not just name calling and divisiveness.\" But a few minutes later, Sanders engaged in some bombastic fearmongering of his own, bemoaning that \"the wealthiest people in America, like the billionaire Koch brothersâ\\x80¦spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and in the process undermine American democracy.\" (David Koch is a trustee of Reason Foundation, which publishes this magazine.)\\n\\nClinton\\'s most controversial instance of Othering during this season came at a September fundraiser in New York, where she said, \"to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump\\'s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobicâ\\x80\\x94you name it.â\\x80¦Now some of those folks, they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America.\" While the irredeemable and un-American twists were new (as was the memorable metaphor), Clinton\\'s behind-closed-doors sentiment only mirrored what the Democratic nominee has said routinely throughout this dreary campaign.\\n\\nAt an October 2015 Democratic presidential primary debate, Clinton was asked by moderator Anderson Cooper, \"Which enemy are you most proud of?\" Her reply, after some throat-clearing: \"Probably the Republicans.\" Some people laughed, but it wasn\\'t really a joke. When Vox Editor in Chief Ezra Klein asked Clinton nine months later whether she regretted the remark, she said, \"Not very much,\" adding: \"You know, they say terrible things about me, much worse than anything I\\'ve ever said about them. That just seems to be part of the political back and forth nowâ\\x80\\x94to appeal to your base, to appeal to the ideologues who support you. We have become so divided.\" Do tell.\\n\\nThe best that you can say about Hillary Clinton\\'s collectivismâ\\x80\\x94and the Democratic habit of mind that accepts and repeats such formulations unblinkinglyâ\\x80\\x94is that at least the deplorables chose their own status, whether through true bigotry or mere party membership. Donald Trump\\'s Others, by contrast, are often born that way.\\n\\nIn June, Trump told The Wall Street Journal that District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was presiding over a case involving the failed Trump University, should have been disqualified by his \"Mexican heritage.\" \"I\\'m building a wall,\" the eventual GOP nominee explained. \"It\\'s an inherent conflict of interest.\"\\n\\nIn a follow-up interview, Face the Nation\\'s John Dickerson asked Trump to clarify what exactly the Mexican parents of an Indiana-born judge had to do with Curiel\\'s adverse rulings in the case. \"Excuse me, I want to build a wall,\" Trump shot back. \"I mean, I don\\'t think it\\'s very confusing.â\\x80¦Has nothing to do with anything except common sense. You know, we have to stop being so politically correct in this country.\"\\n\\nGross generalizations and shorthand stereotypes often make senseâ\\x80\\x94until they don\\'t. On the playgrounds and in the popular culture of my youth, Mexicans were lazy, Poles were stupid, and \"queers\" were people who you\\'d \"smear\" on a football field because they were so weak. Now, Mexicans are uniquely industrious, Poles win Nobel prizes, and the buffest guy at the gym is probably gay. The same thing Donald Trump now says about the Chinese, the entire political and journalistic class was saying about the Japanese in the 1980s. Yes, facts on the ground change, but stereotypes often recede when the dominant culture recognizes them as reductionist, shameful, even ridiculous.\\n\\nReverting to that kind of collectivism, assigning negative value indiscriminately across an entire population, feels retrograde in a country so steeped in individualistic ethos. Once we start dismissing 20 percent of the population (or 47 percent, as with Mitt Romney), particularly in a discussion involving politics, we are playing with fire. Determinism, when wedded to state power, has produced some of the worst moments in American history.\\n\\nAyn Rand\\'s writing on this is hard to top. \"Like every form of determinism,\" Rand wrote in The Virtue of Selfishness, \"racism invalidates the specific attribute which distinguishes man from all other living species: his rational faculty. Racism negates two aspects of man\\'s life: reason and choice, or mind and morality, replacing them with chemical predestination.\"\\n\\nThe problem isn\\'t just racism\\'s malign effects on the recipient. It also has rotting effects on the intellect of the originator: \"Like every other form of collectivism, racism is a quest for the unearned,\" Rand wrote. \"It is a quest for automatic knowledgeâ\\x80\\x94for an automatic evaluation of men\\'s characters that bypasses the responsibility of exercising rational or moral judgment.\"\\n\\nAmerican political discourse in 2016 too is about bypassing the responsibility of judgment and trying to bludgeon people into line through insult comedy. Here\\'s hoping that more and more of our fellow citizens will refuse to take the politicians\\' bait. And that Hillary Clinton starts reading some Ayn Rand.',\n",

       " 'If there s one thing that unites working class Americans of all political persuasions, it s a hatred of Wall Street. Donald Trump knows this   he campaigned on it in Iowa, in fact, saying  I m really good at that stuff. I know Wall Street. I know the people on Wall Street. We re going to have the greatest negotiators of the world, but at the same time, I m not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us. We re going to tax Wall Street. These days, he s singing a different tune. Instead of taxing them, he s cutting taxes on the rich. Instead of  stopping them from getting away with murder,  they re getting rid of the financial regulations that will stop another recession. And instead of standing up for consumers, he s destroying the agency that has recouped over $10 billion from predatory financial companies.After electorally winning the election (while massively losing the popular vote   1.7 million at the time of this writing and growing), he is openly showing what many of us knew along: He doesn t give a single sh*t about any of his supporters, and he will stab them in the back repeatedly and at length until somebody stops him.Donald Trump never had any intention of raising taxes on  hedge fund guys.  After all, they re in the same class of people he is! Rich, and therefore better than you. Why should they have to pay taxes? Trump doesn t, and thinks it s smart.Trump s administration wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, which is the Wall Street reform and consumer protection package passed after the Great Recession to prevent the need for another bailout at taxpayer expense. Trump thinks, instead, that the banks will do better regulating themselves   much the way they did in the years leading up to the 2007-08 crash. Here s what Trump and the GOP are against:An Act to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end  too big to fail,  to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.And it gets worse.As ThinkProgress reports,Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency focused on protecting Americans from predatory and fraudulent bank behavior. It s already recouped more than $10 billion for those who have been targeted by such practices. The CFPB has also written new rules for mortgage lending while extending oversight to some financial firms, such as debt collectors and payday lenders, that had previously gone with little oversight.That s right   Donald Trump wants to get rid of one of the few parts of government that consistently works on behalf of the little guy. They re also targeting seniors:Trump made a campaign promise to impose a moratorium on all new regulations for the financial sector, but he has already targeted existing regulations for immediate dismantling. Trump adviser and hedge fund investor Anthony Scaramucci promised to reverse President Obama s executive action to protect retirees the fiduciary duty rule. It requires all financial advisers to put their clients  interests ahead of their own, rather than being able to steer clients toward more expensive options that make money for themselves. That conflicted advice is estimated to cost retirees $17 billion a year. We ve got to get rid of this,  Scaramucci told the Financial Times, calling it  unnecessary.  He had previously made this pledge while likening the rule to the 1857 Dred Scott Supreme Court decision that denied birthright citizenship to slaves and their descendants.He s giving the banks exactly what they want.In fact, he seems to think that he might need them a little closer to him so that he can really serve them well, because he s actually inviting bank executives to work in his administration   certainly a far cry from his pro-working class messages on the campaign trail. According to Politico, his leading picks for Secretary of the Treasury are a Goldman-Sachs executive and a billionaire investor.The working class Republicans that voted for Trump are some of the people who will be most hurt by the actual policies that the Trump administration wants to put into effect.

       " 'BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temerâ\\x80\\x99s government introduced to Congress on Tuesday a landmark constitutional amendment to cap public spending, seeking to press ahead with unpopular reforms in the wake of last weekendâ\\x80\\x99s municipal elections. Temerâ\\x80\\x99s new center-right government hopes the proposal, which would limit growth in spending to the rate of inflation for up to 20 years, will clear a Congressional committee this week and be put to a vote in the lower house by next week. The amendment is designed to curb a budget deficit equivalent to 10 percent of gross domestic product last year. Hopes for its passage have made Brazilian assets among the best performing in the world this year despite an economy submerged in a two-year recession. In a concession to ease its passage, the government announced on Monday that a cap on health and education expenditure would not go into effect until 2018, rather than next year. Leftist opponents have demanded more time to debate a measure they say violates the spirit of Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s 1988 constitution, which made generous provisions for social spending. They plan to seek a court injunction to block the amendment. Backers warn that Latin Americaâ\\x80\\x99s largest nation, which is wrestling with a sprawling corruption scandal, could follow Greeceâ\\x80\\x99s path to financial meltdown if spending is not controlled. Temer said on Monday that public debt, which ended last year at a level equivalent to two-thirds of economic output, would reach 100 percent of GDP by 2024 without the measure. â\\x80\\x9cIf this change is not adopted, fiscal collapse and the  insolvency of public accounts are inevitable,â\\x80\\x9d lawmaker Darcisio Perondi said in his report to the committee studying the measure. â\\x80\\x9cBrazil could repeat the tragedy of Greece.â\\x80\\x9d  Perondi said the previous government of Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office in August for breaking budget laws, left an onerous legacy of overdrawn accounts, and he called on the lawmakers who impeached her to back the cap. The conclusion of municipal elections in most cities across Brazil last weekend allows Temerâ\\x80\\x99s ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) and its coalition allies a freer hand to back the measure. A small number of cities face a second-round runoff this month. But resistance from Rousseffâ\\x80\\x99s Workers Party and its allies, as well as division within Temerâ\\x80\\x99s own coalition, point to a difficult path for a proposal that requires two approvals in each chamber of Congress by a three-fifths majority. â\\x80\\x9cWe will seek an injunction because this violates the Constitution and the right of five future governments to decide their economic policies,â\\x80\\x9d said opposition leader Jandira Feghali of the Communist Party of Brazil. Temer, 75, who was sworn in to serve the remainder of Rousseffâ\\x80\\x99s term through 2018, had vowed to put Brazil back on its tracks and investors like his promises of fiscal discipline.  But a poll published on Tuesday showed Temer has failed to convince Brazilians that his government is any better than Rousseffâ\\x80\\x99s. The survey by pollster Ibope showed that Temerâ\\x80\\x99s approval ratings remain low and some 68 percent of Brazilians do not trust him.  The lower House is also expected to vote on Tuesday on a bill that changes the rules for the exploration of Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s vast offshore oil reserves in the costly subsalt layer, aimed at boosting private investment in the oil industry.  The proposal removes the obligation for scandal-plagued, debt-ridden state oil company Petrobras to be the only operator of these oil fields and have a minimum 30 percent stake in their development.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan and Donald Trump, the top Republicans in the United States, plan to meet next week to try to unite their party, with both men focused on the Nov. 8 presidential election, but the Wisconsin congressman also perhaps looking further ahead. Speaker of the House of Representatives Ryan has invited Trump, this yearâ\\x80\\x99s likely Republican presidential nominee, to meet on Thursday with Ryan and other congressional leaders on Capitol Hill, Ryanâ\\x80\\x99s office said in a statement on Friday. A key part of the conversation is sure to be Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s combative, in-your-face campaign persona and Republican leadersâ\\x80\\x99 requests for him to tone it down, but political analysts said Ryan will have other considerations in mind, as well. One issue is likely to be his own future, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginiaâ\\x80\\x99s Center for Politics. Ryan, 46, lost his 2012 campaign for vice president as Mitt Romneyâ\\x80\\x99s running mate. Ryan probably has serious doubts that Trump, like Romney, can win this year, Sabato said. If so, Ryan will want to find a balance between accepting Trump, 69, as the nominee and keeping some distance from him, just in case the real estate mogulâ\\x80\\x99s campaign ends in disaster. â\\x80\\x9cSuppose Trump loses overwhelmingly. Would you want to have been siding with the captain of the Titanic, or maybe seen as someone who was begging the captain to watch out for icebergs?â\\x80\\x9d Sabato said, adding that a Trump defeat could push the party in a different direction in 2020, maybe toward Ryan as the nominee. As chairman of the Republican Party convention in Cleveland in July, Ryanâ\\x80\\x99s political tightrope will be especially perilous. One of his objectives will be to provide political cover for his 246 House Republicans so they can choose to embrace or run away from Trump, depending on their home districtsâ\\x80\\x99 politics, with the goal of preserving control of the House, analysts said. Ryan dropped a bombshell on Thursday when he said he was not ready to endorse Trump until he shows he can unify the party, still reeling from a bitter primary campaign that left many establishment Republicans stunned at Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s victory. One moderate Pennsylvania congressman, Representative Charlie Dent, said he thought most of his fellow House Republicans would be comfortable with what Ryan said, because they were â\\x80\\x9cconflictedâ\\x80\\x9d themselves over whether to support Trump. Some Republican lawmakers worry that Trump is not conservative enough; others are more bothered by Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cdivisive, incendiary remarks and lack of substance,â\\x80\\x9d said Dent, who put himself in the latter category. However, a conservative Republican congressman, Raul Labrador of Idaho, told CNN that Ryan â\\x80\\x9cneeds to reconsider what heâ\\x80\\x99s doingâ\\x80\\x9d concerning Trump. â\\x80\\x9cA lot of people that are voting for Donald Trump are totally disaffected with what weâ\\x80\\x99re doing in Washington D.C., and he (Ryan) almost kind of slapped them in the face when he said what he did,â\\x80\\x9d said Labrador, who endorsed Ted Cruz but says he will vote for Trump now that Cruz is out of the race.  As speaker, Ryan has struggled with his deeply divided colleagues over budget issues, funding the battle against the Zika virus, rescuing Puerto Rico from a debt crisis, and helping Flint, Michigan, deal with their contaminated water system. Ryan is â\\x80\\x9ctrying to jawbone Trump into adjusting his positionsâ\\x80\\x9d to line up better with the party establishment, said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar and political analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The â\\x80\\x9cunprecedentedâ\\x80\\x9d move by a congressional leader to distance himself from his partyâ\\x80\\x99s expected nominee, Ornstein said, showed Ryan trying to mold a â\\x80\\x9cless confrontational and divisive approach to minorities and a less isolationist and combative approach to our allies.â\\x80\\x9d In a swipe at Trump on Friday, President Barack Obama warned that occupying the Oval Office â\\x80\\x9cis not a reality show.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",
       " 'Despite the racial outbursts, the insistence that he keep attacking his former primary rivals even though the primaries are over, and the overall haphazard way he is campaigning, Republican chairman Reince Priebus insists that all is well between him and nominee Donald Trump.Of course, like so much in this campaign, that isn t the truth. Behind the scenes, Trump is making a critical error that could doom his attempt to win the presidency more than a simple racist comment, and it is driving the party chairman nuts.Meanwhile, the Trump high-dollar fund-raising operation is showing signs of duress, people here say. A joint fund-raising agreement was hatched last month to split proceeds between the RNC and the Trump campaign. And while the first joint fund-raisers have gone well, RNC chair Reince Priebus has phoned some associates expressing frustration that Trump wants to direct dollars to his own ambitious plans, according to a person who has spoken directly with Priebus, which includes quixotic bids to win deep blue states like California and New York.The RNC did not respond to a request for comment.There isn t any data to indicate that a win in traditionally blue states is remotely possible for Trump to pull off. Most polling has shown that his best shot would come with a winning streak in so-called  purple  states, the same states that both John McCain and Mitt Romney tried to target against President Obama that have swung between both parties with a difference of one percentage point or less.By comparison, no Republican has won California and New York since Ronald Reagan s epic landslide victory in 1984, which was 32 years ago. Both states have delivered huge, lopsided victories to Democratic presidential candidates for decades, and both also consist of the diverse electorates   Latino, black   that are the most opposed to Trump.Republican insiders know and understand this. Trump s ego insists that he should contend in the blue states, especially his home state of New York, but using any money to campaign there is a fool s errand for the Republican Party, made even worse since the GOP is so far behind the Democrats and Secretary Clinton on raising money.It has all the ingredients for an election disaster.Featured image via YouTube',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - Hackers have probed the voting systems of many U.S. states but there is no sign that they have manipulated any voting data, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Saturday. National security officials are investigating a number of possible leads suggesting that cyber-criminals are trying to influence the Nov. 8 presidential election, including by hacking into systems run by the Democratic National Committee. Republican candidate Donald Trump has repeatedly charged that the U.S. election system is â\\x80\\x9criggedâ\\x80\\x9d and top Democrats in Congress have charged that Russia is behind repeated attempts to access both party data and state voting systems. â\\x80\\x9cIn recent months, malicious cyber actors have been scanning a large number of state systems, which could be a preamble to attempted intrusions,â\\x80\\x9d Johnson said in a statement. â\\x80\\x9cIn a few cases, we have determined that malicious actors gained access to state voting-related systems. However, we are not aware at this time of any manipulation of data.â\\x80\\x9d The head of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, last month said the organization had been hacked by Russian state-sponsored agents who were trying to influence the election, when voters will choose between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Trump, a New York real estate developer.

Two medications used to induce abortion won US approval in 2000, but Pro-Life activists successfully implemented legislative restrictions. In 2014: Abortion medication was used in 43 percent of pregnancy terminations at Planned Parenthood clinics. in 2010: Up from 35 percent according to previously unreported figures by Planned Parenthood. In Ohio, Texas and North Dakota: Demand for medication abortions tripled in the last several months to as much as 30 percent of all procedures in some clinics. States with no restrictions: Up to 55 percent in Michigan, 64 percent in Iowa. Studies: Drug induced abortions kill the child up to 95 percent of the time. The abortion pill was approved in France in 1988. Guttmacher Institute: Pill used in 91 percent of abortions in Finland, 80 percent in Scotland. 1 million of the more than 2.75 million U.S. women who have used the abortion pill received it from Planned Parenthood. Federal data: Overall U.S. abortion rates have dropped to a low of 16.9 terminations per 1,000 women aged15-44 in 2011, down from 19.4 per 1,000 in 2008. U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows abortion pills to be used as far as 10 weeks into pregnancies. Planned Parenthood said both types of abortion typically cost from $300 to $1,000. \\n(NEW YORK CITY) American women are ending pregnancies with medication almost as often as with surgery, marking a turning point for abortion in the United States, data reviewed by Reuters shows. \\nThe watershed comes amid an overall decline in abortion, a choice that remains politically charged in the United States, sparking a fiery exchange in the final debate between presidential nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. \\nWhen the two medications used to induce abortion won U.S. approval 16 years ago, the method was expected to quickly overtake the surgical option, as it has in much of Europe. But U.S. abortion opponents persuaded lawmakers in many states to put restrictions on their use. \\nAlthough many limitations remain, innovative dispensing efforts in some states, restricted access to surgical abortions in others and greater awareness boosted medication abortions to 43 percent of pregnancy terminations at Planned Parenthood clinics, the nation's single largest provider, in 2014, up from 35 percent in 2010, according to previously unreported figures from the nonprofit. \\nThe national rate is likely even higher now because of new federal prescribing guidelines that took effect in March.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham on Sunday urged the Pentagon to start moving U.S. military dependents, such as spouses and children, out of South Korea, saying conflict with North Korea is getting close.  It s crazy to send spouses and children to South Korea given the provocation of North Korea,  Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on CBS s  Face the Nation.    So I want them (the Pentagon) to stop sending dependents and I think it s now time to start moving American dependents out of South Korea,  Graham said. The United States has 28,500 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. On Wednesday, North Korea tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can fly over 13,000 km (8,080 miles), placing Washington within target range, South Korea said on Friday. Graham said this development showed conflict is approaching.  We re getting close to military conflict because North Korea is marching toward marrying up the technology of an ICBM  with a nuclear weapon on top that can not only get to America, but deliver the weapon. We re running out of time,  Graham told CBS. The Pentagon referred questions to the Pacific command, which was not immediately available for comment.     White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster told  Fox News Sunday that President Donald Trump is prepared to take action against North Korea but is working to convince China, Russia and other nations to use more economic pressure to help curb its nuclear ambitions.  The president s going to take care of it by, if we have to, doing more ourselves. But what we want to do is convince others, it is in their interest to do more,  McMaster said. The Trump administration has repeatedly said all options are on the table in dealing with North Korea s ballistic and nuclear weapons programs, including military ones, but that it still prefers a diplomatic option.

       " 'Here are a few facts explaining who the DACA recipients really are.  The National UnDACAmented Research Project was compiled by Harvard University researcher Roberto G. Gonzales and published by the Center For Immigration Studies (CIS):In April 2016, the Washington Times reported that a massive anti-deportation infrastructure had emerged to try to protect illegal immigrants from President Trump s crackdown, with advocacy groups coaching potential deportees on how to massage encounters with police, and lawyers and judges working to shield them from charges that would make them priorities for deportation.A video released Monday by a coalition of advocates instructs illegal immigrants not to open the door to federal agents, what proof to demand if they are being arrested and what to say if accosted outside their homes.Meanwhile, attorneys are working to lower charges from some illegal immigrant criminals, hoping to blunt their crimes so they don t show up as high-priority deportation targets.The Washington Times reported on a recent case in California, where an immigrant from India was accused of abusing his wife. The Santa Clara prosecutor told The Daily Beast that he reduced a felony assault charge to a felony accessory after the fact charge in order to spare the man a sentence that would have made him a deportation risk.IJR- The same day that President Donald Trump  rescinded  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) held a joint press conference in which they reintroduced legislation that would see Congress tackling many of the issues that DACA comprises. What Senator Graham and I want to deliver is the message today, is that we need to do our job right here in the United States Senate,  Durbin said.  We need to pass, in this month of September, a DREAM Act, a permanent law in this country, that says that these young people will have their chance to become part of America s future. The DREAM   Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors   Act has been circling Congress for more than a decade, having first been introduced by Durbin and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) in 2001. The legislation has failed to pass each time it has been introduced.Durbin then took a moment to speak directly to the DREAMers, saying,  Do not give up hope. If you are one of those DREAMers,  Durbin continued,  one of those protected by DACA, you need to be part of America in its future. We made a promise to you that if you gave this information to our government about you and your family, it wouldn t be used against you. I don t want that to ever happen. Durbin then turned over the podium to Graham, who said right out of the gate, speaking to the DACA participants,  you have done nothing wrong. You ve demonstrated your ability to be beneficial to the country now and in the future,  Graham said.  The only thing that stands between you and certainty in your life is the Congress. That cannot be that reassuring. Congress is going to have to up its game,  Graham opined. ',\n",

She was referring not to furniture, but fingernails: the unvarnished ones on the hands of her current   Christine Ebersole. They contrasted markedly with Ms. LuPoneâ\\x80\\x99s nails, which she herself had lacquered in shiny maroon, after years observing professional manicurists. â\\x80\\x9cI watch how they depress the fluid,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. LuPone said, pantomiming bottle and brush. â\\x80\\x9cThe problem is, when I put nail polish on it really weakens my nails,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Ebersole said in a sisterly way. â\\x80\\x9cThey just flake off. â\\x80\\x9d The talons were out, in other words, but this was not a catfight. More a chat â\\x80\\x99nâ\\x80\\x99 chew between Tony   actresses getting the chance to share a Broadway stage for the first time in â\\x80\\x9cWar Paint,â\\x80\\x9d one of a   new musicals debuting in a mad cram before the season ends. Dressed in a confusion of stretchy black clothing and scarves, the two women were sharing a sofa in the upper half of a sleek duplex at 663 Fifth Avenue, where the flagship of Elizabeth Ardenâ\\x80\\x99s signature spa, the Red Door, moved five years ago from the florid former Aeolian Building two blocks north. They had refused treatments and were instead efficiently slurping vegetarian soups. In â\\x80\\x9cWar Paint,â\\x80\\x9d which is now in previews and opens at the Nederlander Theater on April 6, Ms. Ebersole, 64, plays Miss Arden, nÃ©e Florence Nightingale Graham: the entrepreneur who made cosmetics, long associated with prostitutes, acceptable and desirable to the American middle and upper classes starting in the 1910s. Ms. LuPone, 67, plays Ardenâ\\x80\\x99s   but equally esteemed competitor, Helena Rubinstein, who imparted both artistic and clinical prestige to the pursuit of beauty, and who is credited with the phrase â\\x80\\x9cthere are no ugly women, only lazy ones. â\\x80\\x9d Bette Davis vs. Joan Crawford Alexis Colby vs. Krystle Carrington: Female rivalries have long meant boffo box office and Nielsen ratings points. But theatergoers hoping for Ms. Ebersole and Ms. LuPone to whack each other with pocketbooks or hurl drinks like Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine in â\\x80\\x9cThe Turning Pointâ\\x80\\x9d are due for disappointment. Rather, their characters fight by issuing new products, raiding staff and investing in premium real estate: penthouses and country spreads for Rubinstein, who donated millions of dollars to arts education and other causes through her foundation an Irish castle and Lexington, Ky. breeding stable for Arden, who was passionately devoted to horses and marched with suffragists. â\\x80\\x9cWe should really look at them as role models,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. LuPone said of the two tycoons. â\\x80\\x9cThey were really inspiring,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Ebersole said. â\\x80\\x9cMy God,â\\x80\\x9d Ms LuPone said. â\\x80\\x9cRegardless of what their personal flaws were, or what drove them  â\\x80\\x94   nothing that they achieved for themselves and then in the name of woman has ever been matched!â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Ebersole, more gently: â\\x80\\x9cThey paved the way, and started before women had the vote. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. LuPone was incensed by news reports about the departing C. E. O. of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer. â\\x80\\x9cHer male replacement is getting twice as much as she is,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cTwice as much!â\\x80\\x9d The gender pay inequity common in the film industry is not an issue for â\\x80\\x9cWar Paint,â\\x80\\x9d which is capitalized at $11 million and carried by its leading ladies, one or both of whom appear in all but four of the showâ\\x80\\x99s numbers. But the fact that its principal creators are all men might arch an eyebrow. The musical takes its title and basic premise from a dual biography by Lindy Woodhead published in 2004 that a few years later inspired a documentary, â\\x80\\x9cThe Powder  the Glory,â\\x80\\x9d to which David Stone, a producer, was introduced by the director James Lapine. Mr. Stone has had tremendous success with â\\x80\\x9cWicked,â\\x80\\x9d another musical centered on female foes, and, among other projects, worked on â\\x80\\x9cThe Vagina Monologuesâ\\x80\\x9d by Eve Ensler. He called her for advice before proceeding. â\\x80\\x9cEve said, â\\x80\\x98This canâ\\x80\\x99t be about makeup.â\\x80\\x99 And itâ\\x80\\x99s not,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Stone said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s about women and beauty and power and how women treat each other. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Stone and Ms. LuPone both wrinkle their noses at the word â\\x80\\x9cdiva,â\\x80\\x9d a description cribbed from Italian opera that is now often applied to any commanding female presence in the entertainment industry, inevitably also suggesting an excess of temperament. â\\x80\\x9cI just canâ\\x80\\x99t stand it,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Stone said. â\\x80\\x9cDiva implies difficult. â\\x80\\x9d At a talk about the show a few months ago, Ms. LuPone proposed â\\x80\\x9cdameâ\\x80\\x9d as an alternative, to approving whoops from the audience. After securing rights to the material, Mr. Stone hired Michael Greif, with whom he had worked on â\\x80\\x9cNext to Normalâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x9d to direct. They brought in the composer Scott Frankel, the lyricist Michael Korie and the book writer Doug Wright, Mr. Greifâ\\x80\\x99s collaborators on the musical â\\x80\\x9cGrey Gardens,â\\x80\\x9d inspired by the Maysles brothersâ\\x80\\x99 cult documentary about the eccentric aristocrats â\\x80\\x9cBig Edieâ\\x80\\x9d Beale and her daughter, â\\x80\\x9cLittle Edie. â\\x80\\x9d Some early workshops of â\\x80\\x9cWar Paintâ\\x80\\x9d featured Donna Murphy in the Arden role but she withdrew for family reasons, and Ms. Ebersole, who had won a 2007 Tony for portraying both Beales at different stages of their lives, assumed the part. She and Ms. LuPone, for whom this is the first musical since the   â\\x80\\x9cWomen on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdownâ\\x80\\x9d (2010) were not shy about participating in the creative process. â\\x80\\x9cBoth of them were very excited to play against the obvious  â\\x80\\x94   feuding,    stars and that kind of energy  â\\x80\\x94   and actually find ways where the competition between them was nourishing,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Frankel said a few hours before curtain on a recent evening. â\\x80\\x9cThese women were enormously sophisticated and tasteful and   in corporate weaponry,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Wright said. â\\x80\\x9cThey didnâ\\x80\\x99t have to reduce things to an insult they could actually wage business warfare against one another and did so very effectively for 50 years. â\\x80\\x9d Anything â\\x80\\x9cthat felt cheap or easy,â\\x80\\x9d he said, the actresses â\\x80\\x9cinstantly rejected. â\\x80\\x9d Criticism of an    tryout in Chicago last summer focused on relentless   between its two subjects, who supposedly never met in real life. About a third of the show has been revised, the creators said, both to fortify the solo appearances and to find novel ways of bringing the characters together onstage. â\\x80\\x9cThere was some tightening,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Frankel said, slipping into   patois. â\\x80\\x9cBecause itâ\\x80\\x99s the two of them, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a little bit of inherent    thatâ\\x80\\x99s intrinsic in the proposition of the evening, but I think we tried to find ways to mix that up in more unexpected ways. â\\x80\\x9d He and his colleagues were adamant that â\\x80\\x9cWar Paintâ\\x80\\x9d is not purely ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 entertainment, though the Broadway audience is disproportionately female, a demographic that has helped make shows like â\\x80\\x9cWaitressâ\\x80\\x9d into hits. â\\x80\\x9cThere are metaphors inherent in the idea of makeup that I think transcend gender,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Wright said. â\\x80\\x9cIt offers a potential mask where you can pretend to be someone you arenâ\\x80\\x99t it offers a disguise if you donâ\\x80\\x99t wish to be recognized it offers an avenue toward a certain kind of perceived   it is a kind of lure to attract someone else. â\\x80\\x9d But with its   costume changes designed by Catherine Zuber, including   hats and piles of glittering jewelry, and makeup by Angelina Avallone, â\\x80\\x9cWar Paintâ\\x80\\x9d has been an occasion for the two stars to reflect on how cosmetics and other trappings have been integral to their long careers. â\\x80\\x9cOnce I put on the wig itâ\\x80\\x99s like â\\x80\\x98O. K. badda bing, badda boom,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Ms. LuPone said. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not the type of actress that goes into a corner and meditates for 20 minutes on the bones of Helena Rubinstein. Do you know what I mean?â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Ebersole said that for performers backstage as well as for many people in real life, â\\x80\\x9cputting on makeup is a really great centering device. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a way of having you focus on what youâ\\x80\\x99re doing. As you put on the mask, then the other things come through. â\\x80\\x9d She recalled her work in the 2001 revival of â\\x80\\x9c42nd Street,â\\x80\\x9d for which she won her first Tony with the help of 1930s regalia by Roger Kirk: â\\x80\\x9cThe costumes just informed everything. â\\x80\\x9d This inspired Ms. LuPone to reminisce about â\\x80\\x9cEvita,â\\x80\\x9d for which she got her first Tony, at 31. â\\x80\\x9cThe amount of  â\\x80\\x94   for lack of a better word  â\\x80\\x94   gack that weâ\\x80\\x99re putting on!â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cI also harken back to that time in â\\x80\\x98Anything Goesâ\\x80\\x99 when I was in those   gowns. Oy, I canâ\\x80\\x99t wear a   gown now to save my life, unless Iâ\\x80\\x99m strapped in. â\\x80\\x9d The two actresses were â\\x80\\x9cbabies in the city together,â\\x80\\x9d as Ms. LuPone put it. She arrived in 1968 to attend Juilliard, where she studied with Marian Seldes, having known she wanted to perform since she was 4, standing downstage right in a tap recital. Ms. Ebersole, who had gone to MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Ill. before enrolling at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1973, had had other plans. â\\x80\\x9cI was going to be a nurse,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cOf course you were,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. LuPone said. â\\x80\\x9cLook at her!â\\x80\\x9d Instead Ms. Ebersole served customers at the Lionâ\\x80\\x99s Rock, a restaurant on the Upper East Side with water splashing down a   slab of red granite. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s condominiums now, I think,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Ms. LuPone, meanwhile, worked at a â\\x80\\x9cwannabe mobsterâ\\x80\\x9d hangout run by a man who imported cages for dancing girls in nightclubs. â\\x80\\x9cMy roommate was one of the dancers, and I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t pretty enough, tall enough or thin enough to be a dancer, so I was a waitress in a   lace â\\x80\\x9d she said. Both women bemoaned a lost era when actors (and stagehands) were recognized and welcomed in the theater district at places like Jimmy Rayâ\\x80\\x99s and Charlie O. â\\x80\\x99s, and spent time after the show socializing rather than cultivating followings on Twitter and YouTube. â\\x80\\x9cI think we have fewer showmen,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. LuPone said. â\\x80\\x9cLike the Irving Thalbergs and the Alex Cohens and the Robert Whiteheads and the people that loved the theater or loved making movies. Itâ\\x80\\x99s such a clichÃ©, but itâ\\x80\\x99s all bean counters. Itâ\\x80\\x99s statistics. Polling. â\\x80\\x9d This was a reminder that the unexpected foil in the   showdown was Charles Revson, the founder of Revlon, rendered in â\\x80\\x9cWar Paintâ\\x80\\x9d by Erik Liberman as â\\x80\\x9ca   carnival barker in an Italian suit. â\\x80\\x9d Itâ\\x80\\x99s a line that for some involved with the production took on new resonance after Donald J. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Overnight, in their view, the musical went from celebration to cautionary tale. After Rubinstein died in 1965, Revson bought her Park Avenue triplex. But that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the final indignity. Last year, the company he founded, which had brought sex back into the midcentury cosmetics marketplace with suggestive ad copy and flashy layouts, took over Elizabeth Arden. â\\x80\\x9cEverybodyâ\\x80\\x99s rolling over in their grave!â\\x80\\x9d Ms. LuPone said. Not that any of these brands make her particularly nostalgic. â\\x80\\x9cI used to be a Georgette Klinger girl. For years,â\\x80\\x9d she said, after the two women packed up a gift of exfoliating face pads and descended nine floors to the lobby. â\\x80\\x9cOh my gosh, Georgette Klinger, I completely forgot that name,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Ebersole said, blinking her blue eyes on the sunny sidewalk. â\\x80\\x9cThat was a salon,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. LuPone said. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99d go in, and close the door, and they were all about getting into your face. They donâ\\x80\\x99t get into your face anymore. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       " 'DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar s Arab critics are targeting a new pressure point in their feud with Doha - the tiny country s ruling family - permitting state-linked media outlets to portray two little-known Qatari princes living abroad as distinguished statesmen.  The publicity, in which the two men are lauded by media in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as talented decision-makers capable of solving the rift, is widely seen as a dig at the prestige of Doha s current leadership. Despite Saudi Arabia and the UAE insisting they do not seek regime change, the publicity appears aimed at upping pressure on Doha, which they accuse of long meddling in their own domestic affairs. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut political and trade ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism and their arch-foe Iran - charges Doha denies. The two men hailing from a branch of the ruling Al-Thani family, silver-haired Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali based in London but now living in Riyadh, and his younger nephew Sheikh Sultan bin Suhaim, now feature regularly on Saudi and UAE channels. Praising Saudi King Salman and his powerful son Crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, they both called this week to convene a meeting of the Qatari ruling family to  discuss the crisis.    Because of the government s current policy that allowed hateful and bitter people to infiltrate Qatar and to spread their poison everywhere, we have now reached the abyss,  Sheikh Sultan, based in Paris, said in a statement carried by UAE-based Sky News Arabia TV. While the princes do not expressly present themselves as replacements to Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, analysts believe their sudden prominence is designed to undermine him - an uphill task for men few Qataris had heard of until recently.  For such a strategy to work, you need to find an alternative that already has a popular base,  said Jean-Marc Rickli, head of global risk and resilience at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.  The move is eye-catching because it appears to test a Gulf taboo: while many Gulf ruling families, including the al-Thani of Qatar, have a record of palace intrigue, fellow dynasties in neighboring states rarely interfere in each other s internal family politics for fear of attracting intrusion in return.  The crisis has pressured Qatar s economy, squeezing company revenues and forcing costly rerouting of trade and air transport that once ran easily through their neighbors  skies and waters. Doha has responded by stepping up trade with Turkey and Iran, handing diplomatic gains to two countries with whom Riyadh and its allies vie for regional influence. Qatar s refusal to accede to 13 demands, including that it shutter popular news channel Al Jazeera, downgrade ties with Tehran and expel Islamist leaders from Doha, may have driven its adversaries to train their sights on the ruling family.  An environment where Qatar becomes a permanent partner for Iran and Turkey would be viewed as highly problematic for the leadership in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,  said Ayham Kamel of the Eurasia Group consultancy.  The Arab quartet is still focused on pressuring Qatar to concede on parts of the 13 demands, but Qatari intransigence is encouraging these states to consider other options.  ',\n",

Read more: PoliticoSATURDAY   THE US HANDS OVER THE INTERNETWashington (AFP)   The US government on Saturday ended its formal oversight role over the internet, handing over management of the online address system to a global non-profit entity.The US Commerce Department announced that its contract had expired with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which manages the internet s so-called  root zone. That leaves ICANN as a self-regulating organization that will be operated by the internet s  stakeholders    engineers, academics, businesses, non-government and government groups.The move is part of a decades-old plan by the US to  privatize  the internet, and backers have said it would help maintain its integrity around the world.US and ICANN officials have said the contract had given Washington a symbolic role as overseer or the internet s  root zone  where new online domains and addresses are created.But critics, including some US lawmakers, argued that this was a  giveaway  by Washington that could allow authoritarian regimes to seize control.A last-ditch effort by critics to block the plan   a lawsuit filed by four US states   failed when a Texas federal judge refused to issue an injunction to stop the transition.Lawrence Strickling, who heads the Commerce Department unit which has managed these functions, issued a brief statement early Saturday confirming the transition of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). As of October 1, 2016, the IANA functions contract has expired,  he said.Stephen Crocker, ICANN s board chairman and one of the engineers who developed the early internet protocols, welcomed the end of the contract. This transition was envisioned 18 years ago, yet it was the tireless work of the global Internet community, which drafted the final proposal, that made this a reality,  he said in a statement. This community validated the multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance. It has shown that a governance model defined by the inclusion of all voices, including business, academics, technical experts, civil society, governments and many others is the best way to assure that the Internet of tomorrow remains as free, open and accessible as the Internet of today. The Internet Society, a group formed by internet founders aimed at keeping the system open, said the transition was a positive step. The IANA transition is a powerful illustration of the multi-stakeholder model and an affirmation of the principle that the best approach to address challenges is through bottom-up, transparent, and consensus-driven processes,  the group said in a statement.Via: Yahoo ',\n",

       " 'Jack Greenberg, a lawyer who became one of the nationâ\\x80\\x99s most effective champions of the civil rights struggle, leading the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. for 23 years and using the law as a weapon in its fight for racial justice before the United States Supreme Court, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 91. His wife, Deborah Cole Greenberg, confirmed his death. She said he had been treated for Parkinsonâ\\x80\\x99s disease for decades. Mr. Greenberg was part of a legendary civil rights legal team assembled by Thurgood Marshall, the founding   of the legal defense fund and later the first   Supreme Court justice. When Mr. Marshall hired him as an assistant counsel in 1949, Mr. Greenberg was just 24 and the civil rights movement, too, was taking wing. A son of Jewish immigrants and a product of New York City, he had developed an abiding intolerance of injustice  â\\x80\\x94   some of it witnessed in the Navy  â\\x80\\x94   that propelled him into law and into Mr. Marshallâ\\x80\\x99s sights. Mr. Greenberg joined a team that, like him, was idealistic yet pragmatic, deliberate yet unafraid. Besides Mr. Marshall there were Robert L. Carter, Constance Baker Motley, Spottswood W. Robinson III and others. Mr. Greenberg was neither the first white nor the first Jew to work for the civil rights of blacks. But he was one of the most powerful white figures in the movement in the 1960s and â\\x80\\x9970s, a distinction that led to friction with both blacks and Jews. Still, Mr. Greenberg helped achieve through the courts what the political system had denied Southern blacks: voting rights, equal pay for equal work, impartial juries, equal access to medical care, equal access to schools and other benefits of citizenship broadly enjoyed by whites. The genius of his legal team, Mr. Greenberg told The New York Times in 2014, was â\\x80\\x9cthe ability to be creative in matters of legal and social justice. â\\x80\\x9d At 27, he helped argue two of the five cases that led to the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which declared an end to the â\\x80\\x9cseparate but equalâ\\x80\\x9d system of racial segregation in the public schools. â\\x80\\x9cI was a kid,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Greenberg said in the interview. â\\x80\\x9cSeven lawyers argued the cases. I was one of them. Now Iâ\\x80\\x99m the only one still alive. â\\x80\\x9d In all, he was involved in more than 40 civil rights cases before the Supreme Court. One was Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, in which the court, ruling in 1969, hastened the integration of schools by declaring that a standard of â\\x80\\x9call deliberate speed,â\\x80\\x9d established in a second Brown case, had become an excuse for delays in Mississippi and should no longer apply anywhere. Another case was Griggs v. Duke Power Company, which led to a 1971 decision offering protections against job discrimination on the basis of race. And in Furman v. Georgia, in 1972, the court effectively placed a moratorium on executions nationwide that would last four years. Mr. Greenberg helped represent the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963 when Dr. King was jailed in Birmingham, Ala. after leading a march there against segregationist laws. The episode led Dr. King to write his influential â\\x80\\x9cLetter From Birmingham Jail. â\\x80\\x9d In the 1960s, Mr. Greenberg established a law project to help the poor fight for their rights under federal programs. He campaigned against the death penalty as racially discriminatory. Under his leadership, the fund supported civil rights efforts on behalf of women,   and   and gay men and lesbians. And he helped found the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. When Mr. Marshall joined the federal bench in 1961, he named Mr. Greenberg to succeed him as   of the defense fund, passing over Mr. Carter and other blacks on the staff and incurring their resentment. Tensions with blacks surfaced soon after Mr. Greenberg took over the fund. The New York Amsterdam News said the appointment could just as well have gone to a black lawyer. Some thought that the day had passed in which a black civil rights organization needed the leadership of whites, no matter how well intended. Mr. Greenberg played down the friction, telling the journalist Louis Lomax that â\\x80\\x9ccivil rights is not a Negro cause it is a human cause. â\\x80\\x9d Speaking in 2014, he insisted that the transition was smooth. â\\x80\\x9cThere was no controversy,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThurgood was no dummy. He spoke to everyone on the board. They all agreed that it was the right decision to make. I would run the place but carry out what I thought were his wishes. â\\x80\\x9d But in 1974, Mr. Carter, by then a Federal District Court judge, wrote a letter to Mr. Greenberg in which he asserted that the legal defense fund under Mr. Greenberg had tried to limit the participation of black lawyers in an observance of the 20th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. Publicity about the event, Judge Carter wrote, had tended â\\x80\\x9cto give the impression that the strategy, planning and preparation that went into Brownâ\\x80\\x9d had been â\\x80\\x9cculled from the brains of white lawyers. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Greenberg, he wrote, had played â\\x80\\x9cat best a secondary roleâ\\x80\\x9d in Brown. In response, Mr. Greenberg called the letter â\\x80\\x9can unfortunate mischaracterization. â\\x80\\x9d Judge Carter died in 2012. Roy Wilkins, who led the N. A. A. C. P. in 1974 and who was regarded as a voice of moderation, also complained that Mr. Greenberg and the Legal Defense Fund had tried to take all the credit for the 1954 case. The fund was founded in 1939 as the legal arm of the N. A. A. C. P. but separated from its parent group in 1957. The groupsâ\\x80\\x99 uneasy relationship was further strained later in the â\\x80\\x9970s when delegates to an N. A. A. C. P. convention in Louisville resolved to withdraw permission to the defense fund to use the initials in its name. Mr. Greenberg refused to alter the name. A painful episode for Mr. Greenberg came in 1982, at Harvard Law School, when the Harvard Black Law Students Association and others objected to his teaching a civil rights course jointly, on a visiting basis, with Julius L. Chambers, a black lawyer and educator. The group called on students to boycott the course, which had previously been taught by Derrick Bell. Mr. Chambers and Mr. Greenberg taught the course anyway, and many prominent blacks came to Mr. Greenbergâ\\x80\\x99s defense. â\\x80\\x9cThe objection that Mr. Greenberg is white is nothing more than blatant racism,â\\x80\\x9d Bayard Rustin, chairman of the A. Philip Randolph Institute, a civil rights group, wrote in a letter to The Times. But Mr. Bell, who supported the boycott, later wrote that â\\x80\\x9cblack students boycotted the course not because Greenberg was white, as some media pundits charged, but because students felt the visiting post should go to someone who could be considered for a permanent position. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Greenbergâ\\x80\\x99s friction with Jewish groups centered on his support for affirmative action. Leaders of the   League thought he had gone too far in embracing the policy as a remedy for racial discrimination in the job market. They saw it as discrimination against whites and believed it would lead to a system of racial quotas. When Mr. Greenberg left the legal defense fund in 1984, its staff had grown to 25 lawyers from its original handful, and its annual budget had more than tripled, to $1. 9 million ($4. 4 million in todayâ\\x80\\x99s dollars). That same year he drafted a landmark New York City law (Local Law 63) that denies tax exemptions to menâ\\x80\\x99s clubs and other private clubs that discriminate on the basis of gender or race. The Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality in 1988. Mr. Greenberg left the legal defense fund in 1984 to become a professor of law at Columbia University, where he had been an adjunct professor since 1970. In 1989 he was named dean of Columbia College. He stepped down as dean in 1993 in a university   but remained a professor at the law school until retiring last year. At Columbia he became particularly engaged with the plight of the Roma, a traditionally nomadic ethnic group often reviled in Europe, concluding in a 2010 report that they continued to be segregated from other students in the schools. â\\x80\\x9cNo European or national judicial or administrative organ has ordered the cessation of segregation in any school,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote, â\\x80\\x9cnor have they addressed the principal means of evasion, white flight. â\\x80\\x9d Jack Greenberg was born on Dec. 22, 1924, the son of Max Greenberg, who was born in Poland and became a certified public accountant without finishing college, and the former Bertha Rosenberg, who was born in Romania. The family lived in Brooklyn and the Bronx while Jack was growing up and, he wrote, instilled in him â\\x80\\x9can abiding concern for those who are disadvantaged. â\\x80\\x9d In his 1994 book, â\\x80\\x9cCrusaders in the Courts: How a Dedicated Band of Lawyers Fought for the Civil Rights Revolution,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Greenberg recounted joining other children in throwing rocks at a Chinese man and forever feeling shame for what he had done. Mr. Greenberg served in the Pacific with the Navy during World War II and went ashore in a landing ship tank in the invasion of Iwo Jima. In the Navy, he wrote, it upset him that all the officers were white and all the stewards who served them were black. He received a bachelorâ\\x80\\x99s degree from Columbia and a law degree from Columbia Law School, where a professor, Walter Gellhorn, encouraged him to pursue his interest in civil liberties and recommended him to Mr. Marshall. Mr. Greenbergâ\\x80\\x99s marriage to Sema Ann Tanzer ended in divorce in 1970. She died in 2013. He married Deborah Cole in 1970. Besides his wife, who is the founding director of the Columbia Law Schoolâ\\x80\\x99s AIDS Law Clinic, he is survived by three children from his first marriage, David, Sarah and Ezra Greenberg (a fourth child, Josiah, died in 2011) his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s two children, Suzanne Greenberg and William Cole, whom Mr. Greenberg adopted a brother, Daniel and five grandchildren. Mr. Greenberg was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2001 by President Bill Clinton. He remained committed to the idea of an integrated society while acknowledging that full equality had not yet been achieved  â\\x80\\x94   â\\x80\\x9cthat in many ways the lives of blacks are not as good as that of whites,â\\x80\\x9d as he wrote in a 2005 memoir of the Brown case. But that case, he said, should always give Americans reason to take heart. â\\x80\\x9cBrown continues to stand for Americansâ\\x80\\x99 determination to live up to the ideals of their Constitution,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote, â\\x80\\x9cand for the proposition that our Supreme Court can be a catalyst for fundamental change. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       " 'BAGHDAD/LONDON (Reuters) - When the Iraqi army and Iranian-backed Shi ite militia entered a key oil processing facility in Iraq s north to retake it from Kurdish Peshmerga forces last week, the installation was deserted and its alarm bells ringing. Engineers and workers on the facility, which processes oil from two major fields in the Kirkuk area of predominantly Sunni Kurdistan, had fled, fearing the military advance.  No one wanted to risk their life and decided to evacuate as stories about the Shi ite militia and Qassem Soleimani were spreading fast,  said a senior Kurdish oil industry source, referring to the head of foreign operations for Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards. The source declined to be identified. Iraqi engineers arrived to the sound of alarm bells warning about system malfunctions, prompting them to immediately shut down wells. Now, they need passwords and expertise from their Kurdish counterparts to restore oil output fully.  The loss of control of Kirkuk oil fields is likely to starve the KRG of vital oil revenue and cause deep concern to global trading houses such as Vitol and Glencore, which have granted the semi-autonomous government billions of dollars in loans against future oil sales. Baghdad s lightning military offensive into northern Iraq came after the Kurdistan Regional Government held an independence referendum last month. Major-General Soleimani, one of the most influential military figures in the Middle East, with reach in Syria and Lebanon, issued tough warnings to Kurdish leaders ahead of the Iraqi military advance.  We went inside the oilfield facilities after Kurdish workers fled and we found overalls and safety boots thrown on the ground,  said an engineer from the Baghdad-run North Oil Company, who declined to be named because he was ordered not to speak publicly about the issue.   It seems that workers took them off and escaped very quickly.   NOC crews entered oil facilities in the Bai Hassan and Avana fields on Oct. 17 for the first time since 2014, when Peshmerga forces drove Islamic State from the area and found all crude oil stations unmanned. Peshmerga fighters had also withdrawn.  After we discovered that some of the key equipment was missing and the control panel was ringing alarms of crude processing malfunction, we immediately shut down oil wells,  the NOC engineer said. A week after the operation, Iraqi engineers are still struggling to resume Kirkuk s oil production, saying they had yet to understand how to operate the equipment processing some 350,000 barrels per day. The military offensive more than halved Kurdistan s oil output and cut its exports to global markets via Turkey by two thirds.  The drop in exports has deprived the region of more than $200 million in revenues over the past week, a Kurdish oil industry source familiar with loadings told Reuters. It has also dealt a further blow to the region s finances already stretched by a fight against Islamic State and a budget crisis caused by a fall in oil prices. The United States has called on both sides to resume dialogue, saying the tensions hamper efforts to fight Islamic State. Resuming normal oil production and exports will be challenging and will take at least another week and will only succeed if Iraqi and Kurdish engineers agree to cooperate, according to both sides. On Tuesday, NOC officials asked Kurdish engineering firm Kar Group to send back its workers, according to sources on both sides. Iraqi engineers need guidance on how to operate recently installed equipment at Bai Hassan and Avana, the sources said. The pumping and operational stations for both oil fields are located in the city of Dahuk, which unlike Kirkuk is still under the control of the Peshmerga forces.  Energy facilities in Kirkuk are more like a locked box and only their crew have the password,  the Iraqi engineer said. Kar Group has, however, so far refrained from going back without security guarantees, according to sources close to the engineering company. Kirkuk, one of the oldest and best known oil areas in the Middle East, had long been under the control of Iraqi forces until it was over-run by Islamic State. In 2014, it was retaken by the Peshmerga, the official security forces of the KRG, as part of their advance on Islamic State. That allowed Kurdistan to regain control of an area it believes is historically Kurdish and ramp up exports from the oil fields while borrowing billions of dollars from trading houses and Russian state oil major Rosneft.  We need to figure out who gets what when the fields resume production. At the moment the potential split of revenues is far from clear,  said the Kurdish oil industry source. Before the referendum, Kurdistan was exporting some 600,000 bpd of crude via Turkey, which it said had made it almost totally economically independent as it could pay its own bills without the need to wait for budget transfers from Baghdad. Under the deal with Baghdad, Kurdistan was exporting 540,000 bpd on behalf of the government in the city of Erbil and some 60,000 bpd on behalf of NOC. With the loss of control of the Kirkuk area, Kurdistan will be in theory left with only 250,000-300,000 bpd of its own output, less than it needs to cover its debt obligations. Vitol, Glencore, Petraco and Trafigura have loaned Kurdistan some $2.5 billion and Russia s Rosneft has loaned some $1.2 billion. Glencore s boss Ivan Glasenberg said last week he could not rule out a rescheduling of the payments. ',\n",

       " 'CARACAS (Reuters) - Jesus Ibarra, a 19-year-old engineering student, has been barely able to walk or talk since a tear gas canister crushed part of his skull during a protest against President Nicolas Maduro and he fell unconscious into a river that carries sewage.  Chronic shortages of medicine in Venezuela forced his family to ask for drug donations so Ibarra could undergo five surgeries on his skull and treatment for infections from the Guaire river.  Ibarra, who cannot return to his studies any time soon, needs to a sixth operation and therapy. It is unclear if he will fully recover.   I speak to my son a lot, and sometimes he makes me understand it was not worth suffering this, that he regrets it, that it was a mistake,  said Ibarra s father Jose at their small home in the sprawling hilltop slum of Petare in Caracas.   But other times he s clearly telling me that it was worth fighting for a change he believes in.       Ibarra is one of nearly 2,000 people injured during four months of fierce anti-Maduro street protests, according to the public prosecutor s office. Rights groups think the number is probably higher.  Venezuela has been torn by political and economic crises that have led to extreme shortages of food and medicine, crushing inflation and the collapse of the local currency. Its    new government structure has been criticized as a dictatorship. Rubber bullets fired at close range, rocks, and tear gas canisters have caused most of the injuries, doctors and rights groups say. Most of those who have been hurt appear to be opposition protesters, but Maduro supporters, security forces and bystanders have also been harmed.     More than 125 people have died in the unrest since April.  Thousands have been arrested.  The unpopular leftist president has said he was facing an armed insurgency intent on overthrowing him.  Opposition politicians have said they were forced to take to the streets after authorities curtailed democratic means for change. They have also accused security forces of using excessive force against protesters. Culinary student Brian Dalati, 22, said he was passing an opposition-manned street barricade on his way to classes in July when police mistook him for a protester. They hit him and fired buckshot at his legs, fracturing both of Dalati s shinbones.  I depend on my siblings to go to the bathroom, shower, brush my teeth, eat, anything. It s infuriating,  he said.  They didn t have to do this. It was pure hate. Thank goodness I will be able to walk again soon.  The government says right-wing media are too focused on injuries to protesters.  Maduro has pointed to a case in which a 21-year-old man was set afire during an opposition protest and died two weeks later. A Reuters witness said the crowd had accused the man of being a thief, but the government said he was targeted for being a Maduro supporter. Protests have subsided since Maduro s government established a controversial legislative superbody three weeks ago, but hundreds of Venezuelans are still struggling to nurse their wounds without medicine and state support.

It s truly a must-read! Please share!I gave a talk at a luncheon a few months ago that was basically relating my story of how my hometown has been Islamized by refugee resettlement. So it makes sense to do a blog post.I m from the Utica, NY area. Utica is the city nicknamed by the UN  the city that loves refugees!  Soon every American city will be a city that loves refugees! Get ready! So I would like to tell you what it is like living in an area where the major city is about 25% (or more) refugee, mainly MuslimI was born in Utica, a  faded industrial town  along the Mohawk River/Erie Canal corridor, and lived there until I was 8-years-old when my family moved to a nearby small college town. I loved living in Utica because there were lots of families on my block, big Catholic families with lots of kids. You could yard-hop, checking out who was available for play. You could bike around the neighborhood. There were block parties in the summer. My grandmother lived up the street. Life was good.My father and his father were born and lived in Utica, NY. My father was a judge in Utica, like his father before him. The Catholic school my father attended is now a community center for refugees. After I moved back to the Utica area as an adult I used to recite  Full fathom five  to the children as we drove by my father s former Catholic school. (Nothing of him that doth fade,/But doth suffer a sea change/Into something rich and strange.)When I had my first child I was living in New York City. Her father and I divorced when she was a baby, and when she was two-years-old, I beat a hasty retreat back home to Upstate NY. There I met my husband. We got married, we had babies (in that order, ahem), and we settled down outside of Utica.When I moved back home one of the first things I noticed was that an old Methodist church was being converted into a bright shiny white new mosque. The local paper touted this as immense progress and featured a local woman who had attended the church as a child and was positively brimming with joy it was being turned into a mosque. If that is the general sentiment, then it s odd that my county went for Trump, right? There are at least two mosques in the city now. They just built another.Where do I start? Utica had always been  the city that loves refugees  but under Obama things accelerated. Muslim immigrants were suddenly in these local bureaucratic positions where they had power over you. This, in what is probably one of the most corrupt states in the union, where the power of the state is everything.The social worker at my daughter s school was a Muslim immigrant. I looked for her profile on the school website, I googled her, I could not find information on her background, resume, qualifications, or educational attainments.When I began to homeschool my daughter the administrator to whom I had to submit paperwork was a Muslim immigrant. To homeschool in New York State you must submit detailed quarterly reports to an administrator at your local school district. I googled the administrator. He also worked at the local Board of Cooperative Educational Services, but I could not find any other information on his background, resume, qualifications, or educational attainments.I was friends with the wife of the Orthodox priest at our church, and she told me that this administrator found some problems with her paperwork and challenged her. It turned out she was right about the issue, and he backed down. Comfy little situation, right?Right before we moved I went to the ER. The nurse practitioner was a Muslim immigrant (Bosnia), and the doctor she worked under was a Muslim immigrant (Pakistan). I remember how during the visit I suddenly became very aware of the cross I always wear around my neck.In 2012 on the way home from my daughter s piano lesson, I left my children in the car, ran into the supermarket for ten minutes, and came out to find a man outside my car who informed me he had called the police. I called my husband and my parents and together we waited for the police officer who eventually arrived and arrested me. Lenore Skenazy wrote an account of the incident in the Wall Street Journal. It is pretty accurate except that it wasn t a suburb, it was a village of less than 2,000 people.It was a terrible thing to do, but it was not hot (we re about two hours from the Canadian border), it was the small safe village where I grew up (I think I was the only arrest that week), and I spent half my childhood hanging out in the car with my brother while my mother did errands. My friend sent me a Salon article (I don t read Salon) about a mom who did the same thing, and she like me was in her hometown where she grew up, and so automatically just living by the rules she grew up with. My mother never got arrested. It didn t occur to me I would be arrested. That s my only arrest. So far. But anyway, the point of this story is I was then investigated (and cleared which I hope should be obvious) by CPS.The CPS worker who investigated me was Muslim.So let me just summarize: the social worker at the school is Muslim, the administrator who ok s homeschooling is Muslim, the CPS worker is Muslim, the nurse practitioner at the ER is Muslim, the doctor at the ER is Muslim. These are positions of authority that wield a lot of power.Are you starting to get the picture?The spring before we moved Utica made national news because of a federal grant to the local community college (two million dollars) for a (Muslim immigrant) professor to teach teenage (Muslim) refugees how to build drones. The grant didn t mention explicitly that the drones would be equipped with bombs or anything, so it was all aboveboard. This was going on like down the road from us. My husband assured me he could shoot any drone out of the sky, and I m sure he could, but curiously enough that didn t assuage my anxiety, but only exacerbated it. The last thing I needed was my husband getting arrested on federal charges for taking down a drone.I looked up the Muslim immigrant professor on Linked In. It was an odd career trajectory. It looked like he had been a soccer coach a few years before. It wasn t exactly clear to me how he had landed his present job where he was getting federal money to train Muslims to build drones, but, hey, that s the Obama era for you.In 2015, a 26-year-old Bosnian refugee in Utica was arrested for supporting ISIS. The local paper reported that in his spare time when he wasn t supporting ISIS, he enjoyed mixed martial arts fighting at the local gym. Local law enforcement complained they hadn t been informed of the investigation. You know and I know that if anything happens, local law enforcement are the first responders.I went to a couple Trump rallies and meetings in Upstate NY before we moved. When I mentioned the arrest of this ISIS supporter to a local businessman at one of the meetings, he got a very serious look and said Utica was full of ISIS and the local police were really worried. The Trump meetings were emotional. The organizer picked a donut shop whose owner was friendly to the Trump platform so we could talk. Everyone went around the table and introduced themselves. Two of the women cried. New York State is not doing well.Don t believe the Start-Up NY commercials. Potemkin Village.My husband lost two jobs in three years in Upstate NY. Not by any fault of his own- he is a very skilled, dedicated, experienced, hard worker- but because his bosses went out of business. His first boss moved to North Carolina. His second boss had to close up shop, which seemed linked to a downturn in the stock market. A lot of the middle class in Upstate NY are boomer retirees, and when the stock market goes down, they get nervous and cut back on renovation and building. My husband is a carpenter.The Upstate New York economy is one of the worst in the country. That s why it s a good place to resettle refugees.After the second time my husband lost his job, I applied for food stamps for the family. When I moved back home I had tried to find a job as a lawyer, I could not. I finally found a job processing letters of credit for an investment bank. My salary was $27,000 a year. I actually got paid an extra $2,000 higher than starting salary for my translation skills. After I had my second child, most of my pay after taxes would have gone to childcare. The New York State tax system penalizes low-income people who work. So I stayed home. My parents helped us with bills.So my husband was unemployed, I was unemployed, we have four children, we certainly qualified for food stamps, and I felt stupid and irresponsible for not applying when we qualified for them, so I applied. The local Department of Social Services does not answer their phone. You can go there and wait in line. It is a very very long line, and a very uncomfortable place to be. By tacit agreement, the white people stick together in the waiting area. The Department of Social Services rejected my application several times without reason. I knew we qualified, so it became for me this bureaucratic challenge that I had to vanquish. It took a lot of wrangling and some certified sign-for-delivery mailings which were expensive. I managed to get us a month of food stamps. It was about $50 a week, I think, for a family of six. I don t know if that s average or not.Want to know why my application was rejected several times even though we qualified? Want to know why it was so difficult to get food stamps? The Department of Social Services in my area is swamped because of the refugees. 25% of the city are refugees. Virtually all of the refugees are on welfare. And when they apply for welfare, they don t do so as an independent entity, as I did. They go through their refugee resettlement agency who deals with the Department of Social Services for them. So basically Americans get the short shrift, and refugees get taken care of. And that s America. This is why so many Democrats voted for Trump. Americans are getting squeezed out by non-Americans at multiple levels.What else to tell you?New York State sued our local school districhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/nyregion/new-york-state-accuses-utica-school-district-of-bias-against-refugees.html?_r=1t for trying to separate teenage refugees from the rest of the students. I went to a CLE where I sat next to a lawyer for the school district, and she was freaking out over this lawsuit. She was like, The state is coming after us, and we don t have any money. My county is a Democrat county, and Trump won my county. Issues like this are why. Americans can see that they are being forced to accommodate non-Americans to their own detriment and expense.There is TB in Utica. I m sure there is more than reported. Obama stopped screening foreigners for TB, which America has been doing since before the days of Ellis Island, and the refugees are from places where TB is endemic. Whenever I was in a hospital- when I gave birth or when I went to the ER- I would be very aware of my surroundings.The local Walmart is full of headscarves and burkas. I cried when I went into my first Walmart in North Carolina and all I saw were Americans.The nice lady who asked me to give a talk a couple months ago on my hometown asked me if there were any refugees who were an  asset to the community . I replied that they do not consider themselves part of your community, so if they are going to be an asset to any community, it is not going to be yours.I hope I ve presented an idea of why I m so opposed to refugee resettlement. I couldn t write this blog post where I m from. I d be scared that someone would target my house. I d be scared of the authorities. I had to wait to get to higher ground to speak more openly.North Carolina is like Heaven. People are so much happier here. I thank God every day we got here. I consider it a  free zone , and I want it to stay free.Please also check out my other blog post on Utica, NY. I wrote it after my husband and I drove into the city on a random Sunday and saw about a dozen refugees (all women, and you know there had to be men as well, who just weren t present at the time) moving into renovated housing. This is in an area where low-income Americans, white and black, languish in subpar housing. A lot went on under the Obama Administration. And I doubt a lot of it was on the books. ',\n",
       " 'Curing meat is why humans could stay put when there was nothing to grow, kill or steal. It is how conquerors and discoverers lasted while they traveled the world. But the refrigerator and the modern food industry  â\\x80\\x94   with its cans, plastic bags and chemicals  â\\x80\\x94   have made the average home cook afraid of this most simple and useful food preparation. There is no good reason for this: All you really need is salt. And the result? Malcolm, my    son, may have said it best, â\\x80\\x9cWhatever is on my bagel is really good. â\\x80\\x9d He was a test taster for   lox I made while madly seasoning and drying out flesh over several months for this article. I had worried that I left the fish socked with salt in the refrigerator too long. The outside was dry, jerkylike, not the silky sort from a package of even average lox. I had to cut deeper  â\\x80\\x94   into fresh wild salmon infused with smoked salt, sugar, fennel fronds and fennel pollen  â\\x80\\x94   to reach the prize. I was surprised by how good it was, and this is no humble brag. You can buy wonderful lox from a store: This was a different taste planet. It was also easy. I made it myself with exactly the fish and flavors I wanted. And the boy liked it, a lot. Unlike the decision to become a better cook generally, which pays off every day, the resolve to do your own curing prompts a few basic questions before you start. Mostly: Why bother? â\\x80\\x9cIt tastes so good is the only answer,â\\x80\\x9d said Brian Polcyn, the chef and an author of one of the most popular books on curing, â\\x80\\x9cCharcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking and Curing. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cA Ford Focus is a good car. It will get you Point A to Point B. No shame in driving it. A Mercedes E class? You can feel the difference. â\\x80\\x9d A second question is one of ambition. Curing spans a range from bacon or basic corned beef to the elaborate,   salamis of Italian or French charcuterie. The latter take much practice dredging eBay and Amazon for humidifiers, grinders, slicers, casings and pH readers, even building a drying room for precise temperatures and moisture. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure itâ\\x80\\x99s a satisfying hobby, but itâ\\x80\\x99s also an insane amount of work  â\\x80\\x94   and requires elevated caution about safety. Cured food is, by definition, not cooked. Without proper precautions, it can foster dangerous bacteria. Rot can be good for wine, beer, cheese or yogurt. It can also make you sick or die. Cured meat that involves fermentation raises that risk. Paul Bertolli, a former chef at Chez Panisse and an early advocate of bringing back   suggests leaving the more complicated stuff to the experts. A great introduction, though it does get complicated, is one of my favorite cookbooks, Mr. Bertolliâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cCooking by Hand. â\\x80\\x9d He went on to found the website Fraâ\\x80\\x99 Mani, dedicated to all things cured he learned from his Italian grandparents in California. What Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been experimenting with for the last eight or so years is not grinding and fermenting but drying out solid pieces of meat as they are transformed with just salt, spices and air. Turns out our ancestors stumbled onto something magical: Salt preserves the meat by sucking the water out, retarding spoilage and concentrating flavor. The process also allows the added flavors to infuse into the meat, making it something different altogether, as well as making it more your own. How long it lasts depends on whom you ask. Itâ\\x80\\x99s safe to say dried meat will last a few weeks in the refrigerator without problems and much longer if frozen, which is perfectly fine. Fresh products like bacon or nondried pancetta go rancid much more quickly and should be checked carefully. Trouble is easy to detect: Iâ\\x80\\x99ve noticed dried meats donâ\\x80\\x99t so much spoil as grow yellowish and donâ\\x80\\x99t smell fresh. Then itâ\\x80\\x99s time to toss them. Donâ\\x80\\x99t think of curing as an heirloom exercise in recreating life how it used to be. Like Mr. Bertolli, many proponents of curing learned it from relatives who did it partly out of love, partly out of necessity. So despite the last few generations of mass produced and preserved food, curing is an art that was never lost. Maybe out of fashion, but ever alive. â\\x80\\x9cFor me, itâ\\x80\\x99s the pleasure of making things you are going to consume yourself,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Bertolli said. â\\x80\\x9cThere is a pride in it. â\\x80\\x9d Iâ\\x80\\x99ve developed a basic and useful repertoire that requires no special equipment, space or even much time: bacon, both American and Italian (pancetta) lox, and duck prosciutto, an impressive and fun little trick that I learned from Mr. Polcyn and that you can brag over at your next dinner party as if you just brought it back from Parma. It cures for just one day under kosher salt alone. I started curing out of love of a particular dish, pasta carbonara. My family and I lived in Rome for four years, and when we moved back to New York in 2008, it was not easy to find guanciale, or cured pig cheek, carbonaraâ\\x80\\x99s essential ingredient, even though weâ\\x80\\x99re in Brooklyn, rightly mocked and loved as the navel of foodie obtuseness. Romans say with snobby certainty you can make carbonara only with guanciale, not pancetta or bacon. Iâ\\x80\\x99m fine with any, but there is no question that guanciale makes the dish taste like Rome. A local shop, Bklyn Larder in Park Slope, made its own and kept us supplied, that is until I came across a recipe from the Philadelphia pasta master Marc Vetri that he called shortcut guanciale. It promised the exotic without much pain or cost: salt, sugar, pepper, garlic, coriander and rosemary rubbed over the cheek and plopped into a Ziploc bag in the refrigerator for just three days. To use right away, you roast it for about three hours. It is sublime. We are fortunate enough to have a fireplace, so I thought: Why not dry it the way they do in Italy? I did, even if it drove the dogs mad, hanging temptingly just behind the screen in the unlit fireplace. Three weeks later I was rewarded with something I felt I didnâ\\x80\\x99t do enough to deserve: It looked Old World on the outside, all tough and dry, the inside a strip of meat encased in almost buttery, flavorful fat. I realize most cooks arenâ\\x80\\x99t going to find regular use for guanciale, though it adds wonders to other pastas, soups and even seafood dishes. For me, though, it lit a fuse: I moved from the pigâ\\x80\\x99s cheek to its belly. Salts, sugar and maple syrup are all you need for tremendous American bacon. Nutmeg, juniper, garlic, thyme and bay leaf make pancetta, which can be used dry or fresh and is singularly versatile in the kitchen. Fish, salmon especially, cures in a few days and makes a New York bagel brunch a special occasion. (I just tried a recipe from Mr. Polcyn curing salmon with beets and fresh horseradish. I recommend it.) The list goes on, for every taste and ambition: jerky, pastrami, corned beef, full hams. I donâ\\x80\\x99t own a smoker, but it notches the art up with little effort. There are websites devoted to prosciutto, which requires only salt, patience and the optimism of being alive in the year or so an entire pig leg takes to dry. Results, apparently, are spectacular. A few basics for new curers: Itâ\\x80\\x99s nice to have a fireplace, for temperature and air flow, but you can hang meat to dry in many places. People use closets, garages, basements, old refrigerators, a kitchenâ\\x80\\x99s     nook. You wonâ\\x80\\x99t smell much of anything as it cures, since it generally is wrapped in plastic for many reasons, mostly because the meat gets quite wet as the salt pulls out the water. But the aroma is terrific: sweet and salty, with flavors like rosemary and cracked pepper at high decibel. Then there are the inevitable controversies of curing, which Iâ\\x80\\x99ll cover here only in outline. This is what the Internet was invented for, and readers of age can decide for themselves. Last year the curing community was set in an uproar over a World Health Organization report that linked cured and processed meat with an increase in colorectal cancer. As with many risks, experts say, moderation slims the chances considerably. There is also a theological debate over whether to use the most common curing salt, often called pink salt or Prague powder. It is a nitrite, and thus poisonous in quantity. Some curers prefer alternatives as safer and more natural. Experts I consulted recommended using it (in the prescribed small amounts) for several reasons: Itâ\\x80\\x99s effective in killing dangerous bacteria and contributes to the taste and color of good cured meat. I do, without apology. Finally, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll say that curing is handy (this was the whole point, before history was even invented) and can save a bundle. One recent rainy Sunday, our younger son, Nelson, came home from a day of hard New York skateboarding with a friend, starving, as    tend to be. We had not strategized dinner. We considered ordering out, but Indian food or sushi would run $60 at least. I looked in the fridge, and dinner assembled itself. A hunk of my old standby, guanciale, sat in a Ziploc. I sautÃ©ed it, added some onion, olive oil, tomato, white wine, pepper flakes and pecorino. And there we had maybe the tastiest of Roman pastas, amatriciana. Took 20 minutes. Cost less than $20 for four. The boys didnâ\\x80\\x99t care where that   salty bacon came from, but they ate and were happy. I was, too, and the pleasure was not just in my stomach.

       " 'In a twist of fate, Donald Trump happened to be in Scotland on the day the world woke up to learn that in a xenophobic ferver the United Kingdom had voted to disembowel itself by leaving the European Union. Within minutes of votes being counted, global financial markets were sent into complete and total disarray. The Pound Sterling dropped to its lowest value in a century. The UK s Prime Minister David Cameron announced he would be resigning. Countries around the world stopped accepting British monetary exchanges because the markets were too unstable.What did Donald Trump, who hopes to someday soon lead the United States, have to say about this unfolding disaster? He was stoked. He reasoned that his Turnberry golf resort was going to make a killing. I think it s a great thing that happened,  Trump told reporters shortly after his helicopter landed at Trump Turnberry.  People are angry, all over the world. People, they re angry. When the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,  Trump added during an afternoon news conference.  For traveling and for other things, I think it very well could turn out to be a positive. To be clear, the pound didn t just go  down    it collapsed.Chart via the Washington PostTrump was not in Scotland for the so-called  brexit  vote, he was there to oversee the opening of a new hotel and golf course. Having unofficially suspended his campaign for the weekend to worry about his golf course profits, Trump was notably over the moon about the UK s self-induced financial collapse. But Trump also seemed irritated that what might be one of the most consequential votes in modern history was ruining his publicity stunt. When reporters pressed him about his feelings towards Brexit, Trump started ignoring the questions entirely and focused on how great the  suites  were at his hotel.But on Twitter, Trump also took the opportunity to prove that he has absolutely no understanding of what the vote was all about anyway. In an effort to  prove  that the world was ripe for right-wing nationalistic takeovers, he tweeted a comment so oblivious that it made international headlines.Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2016Scotland, it was pointed out, uniformly voted to stay in the European Union. The fact that British right-wing nationalists chose to leave is already kickstarting a Scottish independence movement. Very soon, the  United  Kingdom will be neither United nor a Kingdom.

       " 'DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi-led military coalition fighting against the Houthi movement in Yemen said on Monday it would close all air, land and sea ports to the Arabian Peninsula country to stem the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran. The move, which follows the interception of a missile fired toward the Saudi capital Riyadh on Saturday, is likely to worsen a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that according to the United Nations has pushed some seven million people to the brink of famine and left nearly 900,000 infected with cholera.  The Coalition Forces Command decided to temporarily close all Yemeni air, sea and land ports,  the coalition said in a statement on the Saudi state news agency SPA. It said aid workers and humanitarian supplies would continue to be able to access and exit Yemen. The United Nations, however, said it was not given approval for two scheduled humanitarian flights on Monday and was seeking clarification on the coalition s announcement.   The state news agency Saba, run by the Houthis, quoted a source in the navy warning against the closure of ports and said it would have,  catastrophic consequences . The United Nations and international aid organizations have repeatedly criticized the coalition for blocking aid access, especially to north Yemen, which is held by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement battling the Saudi-led coalition. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies have made clear they view Iran as mainly responsible for the Yemen conflict, in which more than 10,000 people have been killed in the past two years. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on his Twitter account on Monday that Riyadh reserved the right to respond to what he called Iran s  hostile actions . Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed al-Khalifa also tweeted that Iran was the real danger to the region. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Saudi Arabia was blaming Tehran for the consequences of its own  wars of aggression .  On Sunday the coalition accused the Houthis of  dangerous escalation (that) came because of Iranian support  after Saudi air defences intercepted the ballistic missile heading toward Riyadh. It was brought down near Riyadh airport without causing casualties. Iran rejected the criticism as  destructive and provocative . Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi  referred to the war crimes and aggression of the Saudis during the past years and said the reaction by Yemenis is an independent reaction ... and not a move caused by another country s action or incitement , a ministry statement said. U.S. President Donald Trump has also blamed Iran for Saturday s missile attack, but the head of Iran s Revolutionary Guards rejected that view as  slander . The Houthis are fighters drawn mainly from the Zaydi Shi ite minority which ruled a 1,000-year kingdom in northern Yemen until 1962. The Saudi-led coalition has been targeting the Houthis since they seized parts of Yemen in 2015, including the capital Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee and seek help from neighboring Saudi Arabia. On Sunday a suicide car bomber blew himself up at a security checkpoint in the southern port city of Aden, killing 15 people and wounding at least 20, residents and a security officials said. Aden is the interim headquarters of Yemen s internationally recognized government. ',\n",

       " 'Welcome to the big leagues, kid.Donald Trump s Supreme Court Justice only made it through Senate confirmation because Republicans changed the rules so they could complete their robbery of the seat from President Obama pick Merrick Garland.Neil Gorsuch now sits on the high court and his first day was Monday. And of course, just like Trump, he embarrassed himself from the get-go.Gorsuch s first case involved a Census Bureau worker who had been dismissed and filed a lawsuit over it.The former government employee s lawyers want the entire case to be allowed to move forward instead of only part of it being heard by the federal appeals courts. Rather than keep his mouth shut and learn, Gorsuch apparently decided to try to prove that he belonged there.And he didn t waste time. Gorsuch was argumentative and spent lots of time on wording. In other words, it looks like Gorsuch is going to be an asshole judge who is going to base every decision he makes on exact wording and his interpretation of those words. He s going to nitpick and decide cases on technicalities.But then Gorsuch decided to go even further by changing the decorum of the court. Channeling Trump, Gorsuch literally accused attorney Chris Landau of lying in open court.According to Bloomberg,Landau asked the court to let the man s entire suit go forward in a federal district court, rather than waiting for part of the case to be addressed first by a federal appeals court. When Landau said he wasn t asking the court to  break any new ground,  Gorsuch gave a pointed response. No, just to continue to make it up,  Gorsuch said.But Landau is correct. As Bloomberg points out, there is plenty of precedent of the Supreme Court allowing such lawsuits to move forward in their entirety. So Landau really isn t asking the high court to do anything different than it has before. He s asking them to uphold precedent, something Gorsuch clearly has no interest in doing regardless of what the law says.But Justice Elena Kagan was quick to put Gorsuch in his place and humiliated him in the process. This would be kind of a revolution,  she began.  I mean, to the extent you can have a revolution in this kind of case. The room laughed as everyone recognized a good Supreme Court burn.So just like Donald Trump, Gorsuch is an embarrassment.Frankly, not only should Trump be impeached, Gorsuch should be impeached as well. He doesn t belong in the position he currently holds. It s clear he has no respect for Supreme Court decorum and that he will make partisan decisions regardless of precedent and the law. And Republicans are the ones to blame for this. They chose Trump to be their leader and they forced Gorsuch upon the Supreme Court. It s up to Democrats to fix both of these embarrassments as soon as they take back control of Congress.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'HARARE (Reuters) - Robert Mugabe s 37-year rule may be over, but a culture of political fawning by the Zimbabwean state media and fear of those in authority still flourishes.  The Herald newspaper and the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation - state and ruling ZANU-PF party mouthpieces - routinely heaped lavish praise on the 93-year-old Mugabe and his wife Grace in sycophantic articles and commentaries. With the sudden change of guard, Zimbabwe s official media is having a hard time shaking off old habits and is now tailoring its eulogies to fit Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe s successor. State radio intersperses programs with martial music from the war of independence in honor of Mnangagwa s war veteran allies and the army.   One morning talk show host spoke glowingly on Tuesday of seeing the presidential motorcade at 0645 GMT. This, he said, signaled the new leader was keeping his word to hit the ground running.  The president is showing the way so get to work on time,  he said. Mnangagwa, 75, a close Mugabe ally for several decades, took power after the military takeover on Nov. 15 following a succession battle that split the ruling ZANU-PF party.  Comrade Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, (is) a true son of the soil who sacrificed his entire life to serving Zibmabwe as evidenced by the role he played in the liberation struggle as well as after independence up to this day. We are blessed to have you as our leader,  an advertisement by the ministry for women affairs, gender and community development gushed in the  Herald. Not all within the ruling party are comfortable with the trend though. Justice Wadyajena, a Mnangagwa admirer and outspoken ZANU-PF parliamentarian, reminded his Twitter followers of the dangers of personality cults.  Those falling all over each other pledging loyalty to President ED are just brutes playing meek,  Wadyajena wrote, referring to Mnangagwa by the initials of his first and middle names.   If you really are principled, there s no reason to bootlick, your conduct should speak for itself. We ve seen the danger of personalizing governance and gatekeeping a NATIONAL FIGURE!!  Mnangagwa, who served Mugabe loyally for 52 years, is expected to form a new cabinet this week. Zimbabweans are watching to see if he breaks with the past and names a broad-based government or selects figures from the Mugabe era s old guard. ',\n",

       " 'Douglas Murray, author of The Strange Death Of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam gives a stunning account of the  self murder  or Europe in the  Death Of Europe  article published by ExpressUKI have travelled to the places where migrants continue to land and the places where they keep ending up. Everywhere I have gone I have come to the same conclusion: our continent is in the process of self-murder.Amid the day-to-day distraction of life and politics, it is easy to forget this biggest event of our time. All pale into insignificance besides the story of the loss by Europeans of the only place we had to call home.Whenever this country does have a debate about immigration it is minuscule. It tends to focus on Calais. The British public sees footage of people sitting in makeshift tents or hurling missiles into the roads to slow the trucks down so they can board them and break into Britain.Each time actors, celebrities and politicians head to Calais and visit the camp. They return to tell the British public that it must be more open-hearted and generous.The argument they make is humane. It is an understandable reaction to human misery but it is a core part of our society s suicide mission.Take that example of Calais. Before the latest clearance of the camp there were about 6,000 people living there. None of them should have been there.By being there they had already broken every one of the rules that our continent put in place which demands they seek asylum in the first country of arrival. Almost nobody arrives into France first.All these people have landed in Greece or Italy and made their way north.And yet still the celebrities and others pick at our consciences. Can we not be generous and at least let in the people who are there? It is wholly understandable   and also ill-informed madness.Over this year s Easter weekend alone about 8,000 people were picked up between the coast of north Africa and the south of Italy.They were described   as everyone always is   as being  rescued . In fact what happens   what has been happening for years   is that each day boats filled with migrants set out from north Africa.During the heights of the migration crisis of 2015, when Germany s Chancellor Angela Merkel opened up the doors of Europe to the world, the whole continent began to buckle.But in reality that flood of millions into Europe only sped up a process that had been under way for years. Ever since the postwar period European governments had encouraged migrant workers to come in.At first   as Chancellor Merkel herself admitted in a speech in 2010   they expected the workers to return home. But they didn t. They stayed. As did the flow after that and the ones for decades after that.The governments of countries such as ours failed to get anything right. All their predictions were wrong for decades. They were wrong that people would stay for only a short time. Wrong to think that they would not continue to come in large numbers.Wrong that they might not want to bring their extended families to join them. And wrong to think that once the tap was turned on anything but very radical action could ever bring the numbers to a controllable level.During the course of researching The Strange Death Of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam, I have travelled to see the places where those migrants who arrive on our continent end up. Last year the migrant crisis was widely believed to have slowed down.But it had not and its effects were still visible everywhere. In the outskirts of Paris I saw hundreds of young sub-Saharan men living in tents in the middle of roadways. The French police would occasionally move them a few hundred feet further along.In remote parts of Sweden areas that used to be filled with Swedes are inhabited instead by the residents of other continents.Still the dream of some Europeans is that the arrivals into Europe will become European. It is more likely that Europe will simply begin to look increasingly Third World.

[â\\x80\\x9cThe recent testimony of the director added that last straw to the camelâ\\x80\\x99s back and proved that heâ\\x80\\x99s unfit to serve, and that heâ\\x80\\x99s lost the confidence not only of the president but of the agents that serve under him,â\\x80\\x9d Gorka said of Comey.  â\\x80\\x9cBefore I came into the White House, I spent many years training and educating FBI agents, so I have lots of connections with them,â\\x80\\x9d he said.  â\\x80\\x9cWhen they tell you from one of the field offices that when the director gave that infamous press conference, where for 13 minutes he built a watertight case for the prosecution of Hillary Clinton, and then in the last minute punted and said â\\x80\\x98no, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve decided not to recommend prosecutionâ\\x80\\x99  â\\x80\\x94   when half of the agents in that field office stood up, as I was told by a reliable source, put on their jackets and left the office for the next four days, then you know your situation is untenable.

       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S. and Turkish troops are  illegal invader  forces on Syrian territory and Syria will  deal with  them, a top adviser to President Bashar al-Assad said on Tuesday. Bouthaina Shaaban also said in a television interview that Damascus would not give up on the northern city of Raqqa, which was liberated from Islamic State last month by the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).  Turkey today is a colonizer country, its forces on our soil are illegal, just as the American forces are on our soil  illegally,  she told Lebanese channel al-Mayadeen.  We will deal with this issue as we deal with any illegal invader force on our lands,  she said, without elaborating. Assad s forces, helped by Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, have managed to reestablish control over most of Syria over the past two years. The United States and Turkey are backing various rebel groups opposed to both Assad and to Islamic State. Turkey has started setting up observation points in Idlib province in northwest Syria under a deal with Assad s allies, Russia and Iran. The U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State in Syria has repeatedly said it does not seek to fight Assad s forces, though Washington and Ankara both want the president to step down. The SDF has said Raqqa will be part of a decentralized  federal Syria  and hopes for a new phase of negotiations that will shore up Kurdish autonomy in northern Syria, but last Friday a senior Iranian official said Syrian government forces would advance soon to take the city.  Everything is up to the Syrians and to discussions between Syrians, and there cannot be discussion on the division or cutting up of a part of the country or on so-called federalism,  Shaaban said. She added that what happened in Iraqi Kurdistan  should be a lesson  to the SDF, referring to Iraq s Kurdish leaders who suffered a major blow when the central government in Baghdad - backed by Iran and Turkey - retaliated against them for holding an independence referendum last month. Shaaban also said comments by the Syrian foreign minister in September, when he said Damascus was open to negotiations with the Kurds over their demand for autonomy within Syria s borders, had been misinterpreted.  I don t think any government can discuss with any group when it comes to the topic of the country s unity,  she said. Earlier on Tuesday, Assad said the army and its allies would keep fighting in Syria after it has driven Islamic State militants from their last significant stronghold in the country, in Deir al-Zor province. He also indicated that he might take the war to the SDF, which controls more than a quarter of Syria, by saying the war must target those who seek to  divide and weaken states . ',\n",

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/putin-ready-to-restore-relations-with-us.html Following Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s victory in the presidential election, Russian leader Vladimir Putin said that his country is ready and looking forward to restoring bilateral relations with the United States. Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has also said that one of the first things the new US leader should do is reach out to Russian President to reset relations. He said anti-Russian sentiment in America has reached boiling point and was at its worst level since the Cold War. Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump on his victory, expressing hope that the two countries will continue collaborative work on international issues. â\\x80\\x94 Reference RT reports :â\\x80\\x9cWe heard [Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s] campaign rhetoric while still a candidate for the US presidency, which was focused on restoring the relations between Russia and the United States,â\\x80\\x9d President Putin said, speaking at the presentation ceremony of foreign ambassadorsâ\\x80\\x99 letters of credentials in Moscow.â\\x80\\x9cWe understand and are aware that it will be a difficult path in the light of the degradation in which, unfortunately, the relationship between Russia and the US are at the moment,â\\x80\\x9d he added. Speaking about the degraded state of relations between the countries, the president once again stressed that â\\x80\\x9cit is not our fault that Russia-US relations are as you see them.â\\x80\\x9d     Earlier today, in a message to Donald Trump the Russian President expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each otherâ\\x80\\x99s views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US. The Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some â\\x80\\x9cburning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,â\\x80\\x9d RIA Novosti reported. On top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that â\\x80\\x9cbuilding a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each otherâ\\x80\\x99s positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.â\\x80\\x9d Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin has also expressed hope that Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s victory in the presidential election will help pave the way for a more constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington.â\\x80\\x9cThe current US-Russian relations cannot be called friendly. Hopefully, with the new US president a more constructive dialogue will be possible between our countries,â\\x80\\x9d he said.â\\x80\\x9cThe Russian Parliament will welcome and support any steps in this direction,â\\x80\\x9d Volodin added on Wednesday. A member of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security, Senator Aleksey Pushkov, has meanwhile noted that Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s stake on the conflict with Russia has eventually done her a terrible disservice.â\\x80\\x9c[Playing the] â\\x80\\x98Russian cardâ\\x80\\x99 and portraying Putin as a bad guy did not help Clinton. On the contrary, staking on the conflict with Moscow has only caused fear, doing her a disservice,â\\x80\\x9d he tweeted. According to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s relations with the US â\\x80\\x9cwas not our choice,â\\x80\\x9d however. For things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month. The US will have to negotiate with Russia on finding solutions to international issues as no state is now able to act alone, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week, adding that problems in bilateral relations began to mount long before the Ukrainian crisis broke out in 2014.

And the fact that I can t tell her  yes  with one hundred percent certainty, is heartbreaking. And there are a lot of people telling me,  hey man, don t worry, Trump s not really gonna ban all Muslims,  but I don t know, man. That is my mom. And I need her back home, because I love her Then adding some levity to the very serious situation, he says:  and she owes me three hundred dollars.

       " '(Reuters) - Maineâ\\x80\\x99s two most prominent Republicans grabbed headlines this week with political moves that were widely different in style and substance, which some insiders said could risk the partyâ\\x80\\x99s stature in the northeastern state. U.S. Senator Susan Collins won praise from Democrats for saying she would not vote for a White House-backed healthcare reform bill while Governor Paul LePage revved up his conservative base by saying he was ready for a state government shutdown if legislators did not agree with his calls for budget cuts. The move by Collins, a four-term moderate, was in keeping with Maineâ\\x80\\x99s reputation for producing independent-minded legislators willing to buck their partyâ\\x80\\x99s leadership in Washington. That tradition was challenged by LePage, who first ran for office in 2010 on a wave of populist Tea Party support and won two three-way races with less than a majority of the vote. â\\x80\\x9cWhat you see is a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican party in Maine,â\\x80\\x9d said David Farmer, a Democratic political consultant who worked on the 2014 campaign of LePageâ\\x80\\x99s Democratic challenger. â\\x80\\x9cIs it going to be the belligerent, angry Governor LePage or is it going to be the thorough and pragmatic but still conservative Senator Collins?â\\x80\\x9d Republican lobbyist and political operative Lance Dutson largely agreed. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s an ideological tipping point,â\\x80\\x9d said Dutson, who worked on Collinsâ\\x80\\x99 2014 reelection campaign, which she won with 68 percent of the vote. Maine has a tradition of successful third-party candidates, notably independent U.S. Senator Angus King, and has more unaffiliated voters than those registered as either Democrats or Republicans. â\\x80\\x9cIn the long run, the Collins model has proven itself,â\\x80\\x9d Dutson said. â\\x80\\x9cYou canâ\\x80\\x99t be an orthodox Republican and talk only to Republicans like LePage and win as much support.â\\x80\\x9d Collins and LePage have publicly disagreed over President Donald Trump, whose brusque style and populist approach is similar to the Maine governorâ\\x80\\x99s. LePage was an early supporter of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s White House campaign. When Collins said last year that she would not vote for the New York real estate developer, LePage told local media he was â\\x80\\x9cnot a Susan Collins fan.â\\x80\\x9d The chair of the stateâ\\x80\\x99s Republican party saw no downside to the diverging style and politics of the two, saying the wide gap represented by the two was an illustration of the partyâ\\x80\\x99s wide appeal in Maine. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re an inclusive party, we have strong conservatives, libertarians and we have our moderates, but weâ\\x80\\x99re a party, weâ\\x80\\x99re a party of reform and we are going to stick together,â\\x80\\x9d said Demi Kouzounas, a dentist who was elected as the party chair in January. â\\x80\\x9cWe support both of them strongly.â\\x80\\x9d The gap between the two was as clear in the style of their comments as it was in its substance. Collins said she had â\\x80\\x9cserious concernsâ\\x80\\x9d about the Senate bill backed by Trump as a replacement to the Affordable Healthcare Act, known as Obamacare. After the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would cause 22 million Americans to lose their healthcare insurance over the next decade, Collins became one of a handful of Senate Republicans to say they could not support the bill in its current form, leading to Tuesdayâ\\x80\\x99s decision to delay the vote. Also on Tuesday, LePage told a radio interviewer that he was ready to shut down the state government ahead of a holiday weekend that is crucial for businesses catering to tourists, if Democratic lawmakers would not agree to $145 million in spending cuts in the stateâ\\x80\\x99s next two-year budget of roughly $7 billion. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m the worst guy in the world to play chicken with, because I donâ\\x80\\x99t veer either way,â\\x80\\x9d LePage told WMOV radio. â\\x80\\x9cIf thereâ\\x80\\x99s a collision to be had, itâ\\x80\\x99s coming.â\\x80\\x9d The Democrats and Republicans blame each other for the stateâ\\x80\\x99s budget impasse, which is focused on a debate over how to fund the public schools. A government shutdown could further expose Republican rifts and turn more moderate Republicans against LePageâ\\x80\\x99s tactics, suggested Phil Bartlett, a former state senator who now serves as chairman of the Maine Democratic party. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s been saved by the fact that cooler minds have prevailed to prevent the worst of his impulses,â\\x80\\x9d Bartlett said. â\\x80\\x9cBut weâ\\x80\\x99re now seeing that he and the House Republicans seem to be willing to shut down the government.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",
       " 'HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s stock market has shed $6 billion while its main index has slumped 40 percent since last Wednesday when the military seized power leading to the fall of Robert Mugabe, stock exchange data showed on Thursday. The main industrial index was at 315.12 points compared with 527.27 points on Wednesday last week when the military announced its takeover and put former president Mugabe under house arrest. On Thursday the index fell 4.4 percent. The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange had been on a rapid rise in the last two months, driven by investors seeking a safe haven for their investment amid fears of a return to hyperinflation in an economy suffering acute shortages of foreign exchange. But analysts said the market had entered a period of correction on investor optimism of a change in economic policy in a post-Mugabe era.  Market capitalization was $9 billion, down from $15 billion last week, bourse data showed. On the currency front, black market rates for buying cash dollars softened further on Thursday.  Buying $100 using electronic transfer cost $150, down from $180 last week. Some black market traders said they were not buying dollars at all, anticipating further softening of rates. Zimbabwe adopted the U.S. dollar in 2009, along with Britain s pound and the South African rand, to tame inflation that topped out at 500 billion percent.   The market is adjusting back to reality,  an analyst at a Harare-based asset management company said.  The gains that we had seen were being fueled by an outlook of a return to hyperinflation, continued isolation of Zimbabwe by international lenders as well as well as a depressed economic outlook.  An analyst at a local stockbrocking firm said Mnangagwa had hit the right notes with his speech on Wednesday. Mnangagwa said he wanted to grow the economy, create jobs and for Zimbabwe to re-engage the international community as the country has faced isolation since 1999 when it defaulted on its debt with the International Monetary Fund. Most of Zimbabwe s 13 million people remain poor and face currency shortages and sky-high unemployment, something Mnangagwa promised to address. ',\n",

       " 'This story just proves what we ve been saying all along. When it comes to unions, it s not about the members, it s about the union leadership and how they can increase their membership numbers (dues). Aiding union leadership in their quest to add members to flailing union membership numbers is just a way for Obama to keep the skids greased and ensure future contributions from one of the largest Democrat party donors (unions) in America. Congressional investigators say they ve uncovered another attempt by the Obama administration to aid illegal immigrants in the U.S.   this time, by teaching foreign workers lessons on union organizing.The National Labor Relations Board has entered into agreements with Mexico, Ecuador and the Philippines to teach workers from those countries in the United States their rights when it comes to union activity.The agreements reportedly don t distinguish between illegal and legal immigrants. But lawmakers are worried it s part of an effort to shield illegal immigrants specifically, by encouraging them to join a union and get protection.NLRB spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek explained to Fox News that under the National Labor Relations Act,  employees, whether documented or undocumented, are protected from retaliation due to union or other protected concerted activity. That means employers could be charged for dismissing an illegal immigrant worker   if the firing is determined to be tied to the worker s union activityHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia, argued illegal immigrant workers could soon learn to exploit the system, creating a catch-22 for businesses. They could instead be charged with violating the National Labor Relations Act because someone will claim that they re doing it because the individual is engaged in unionization activities,  Goodlatte said.He also claimed the Obama administration was trying to keep the NLRB union education agreements, which were originally signed in 2013 and 2014, quiet. This is the first we ve learned of this and it s the first that news organizations have learned of this   and they didn t learn it because the administration came out and told them,  Goodlatte told Fox News. They learned about it because of leaked materials, and again, that is not the kind of transparency the American people expect of their government. An NLRB official, though, disputed the notion that the agreement was a  new development or something that was intentionally being kept out of the news. Yet it isn t just the NLRB that could view union activity as a shield for illegal immigrants.In June 2011, then-Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton issued a memo saying:  ICE officers, special agents and attorneys are reminded to exercise all appropriate discretion on a case-by-case basis when making detention and enforcement decisions in the cases . . . [of] individuals engaging in a protected activity related to civil or other rights (for example, union organizing). While this may serve as a way to boost union membership at a time when their numbers are trending downward, one activist said it will likely hurt U.S. citizen union members in the end. It seems that the union is almost selling out the interests of American workers and legal immigrant workers in order to boost its membership by appealing to illegal workers and getting the assistance of other countries in doing that,  Jessica Vaughan, of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Fox News.Via: FOX News',\n",
       " 'BRASILIA/CARACAS (Reuters) - Dismissed Venezuelan prosecutor Luisa Ortega said on Wednesday she had evidence that President Nicolas Maduro was involved in corruption with construction company Odebrecht. Ortega, 59, was a key player in Venezuela s government but broke with it in March. She fled last week to Colombia by boat and on Wednesday morning landed in Brazil. Ortega said she had been persecuted in an effort to hide details of high-level corruption, saying she had proof, though she offered none. Ortega linked the Odebrecht scandal with Maduro and Socialist Party heavyweights including Diosdado Cabello and Jorge Rodriguez. Ortega said she had evidence that Cabello received some $100 million from the Brazilian company.  The international community must investigate such cases,  she told a news conference. Venezuelan authorities did not respond to a request for comment. Odebrecht admitted in a settlement with U.S. and Brazilian prosecutors to paying bribes across 12 countries to win contracts. According to a U.S. court ruling, between 2001 and 2016, Odebrecht paid about $788 million in bribes in countries including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. Ortega was removed from her position early this month by Venezuela s newly formed constituent assembly, a controversial pro-government body whose installation was called dictatorial by governments worldwide. Maduro said on Tuesday he would seek Ortega s arrest, accusing her of having worked for some time with the United States. Maduro blames Washington for many of Venezuela s problems, including triple-digit inflation, shortages of basic goods and months of anti-government unrest. In Caracas, state-controlled television broadcast images on Wednesday of a police operation in what it said was Ortega s apartment. The cameras showed marble floors, large paintings of Ortega herself and one by Andy Warhol, a cellar containing an array of expensive wines and a wardrobe filled with designer labels. Ortega said she would give details of the corruption cases to authorities in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. Since settling in the United States, Brazil and Switzerland for a record $3.5 billion, Odebrecht has sought to negotiate leniency deals that would allow it to keep operating in other countries across Latin America.

Yet, those voters will still have a voice, a voice that needs to be heard, and a message that needs to be spread far and wide.Hillary s response was honest, clear, to the point, and one that needs to be heard by every progressive everywhere who doesn t want to see the nation fall into the hands of Donald Trump. She said: I m three million votes ahead of Senator Sanders, nearly 300 pledged delegates ahead of him. He has to make his own mind up.But I was very heartened to hear him say last week that he is going to work seven days a week to make sure Donald Trump doesn t become president. And I want to unify the party. I see a great role and opportunity for him and his supporters to be part of that unified party, to move into not just November to win the election against Donald Trump, but to then govern based on the progressive goals that he and I share.We both want to raise the minimum wage. We both understand you have got to rein in bad actors on Wall Street and in corporate America to make sure they don t wreck Main Street. We have a lot of the same goals. And I hope we can unify around them. And she s absolutely correct. While the means to achieve some of the goals are different, the goals, nonetheless, are pretty much the same. While Bernie wants to overhaul health care and education in one fell swoop, Hillary wants the same things, but done over time. It s all about unifying behind the message and making sure we get there somehow, because if Donald Trump is to become president, or we can t manage to turn Congress blue again, honestly, it won t really matter who is president. Everything that needs to get done would be virtually impossible (see also: President Barack Obama with Republican Congress).No matter who the Democratic candidate for president is, it s time to unite behind them with the common goal of progress for the greater good, not just the few on top. Let s do this, progressives.Watch the whole segment from Face the Nation here:Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey will testify next Thursday before a U.S. Senate panel investigating Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, in a hearing that could add to difficulties facing President Donald Trump. In his first public appearance since Trump fired him on May 9, Comey will address the Senate Intelligence Committee in both an open session and behind closed doors, which would allow him to discuss classified information, the committee said on Thursday. Comey was leading the FBIâ\\x80\\x99s probe into the allegations, and his firing sparked a political uproar. Facing rising pressure, the Justice Department last month named Robert Mueller, another former FBI chief, as a special counsel to investigate the matter. The Justice Department and multiple U.S. congressional committees are investigating Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s actions in the 2016 presidential election and questions about possible collusion between Russian officials and Trump campaign associates. At next weekâ\\x80\\x99s hearing, Comey is expected to be asked about conversations in which Trump is reported to have pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, whose ties to Russia are under scrutiny. Controversy erupted again this week after the Republican head of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, approved subpoenas to the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency for information relating to the â\\x80\\x9cunmaskingâ\\x80\\x9d of the names of Trump campaign advisers inadvertently picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts. The White House and Nunes have alleged that former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s administration eavesdropped on Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign, an assertion that Comey has disputed and current U.S. officials dismiss as absurd. Four current and former U.S. officials who have reviewed the materials told Reuters there was no evidence that political motives drove Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s aides to request the names be unredacted. â\\x80\\x9cThere is no substance to this, so the only way to look at it is as an attempt to distract the headlines and the public from Comeyâ\\x80\\x99s public testimony and Muellerâ\\x80\\x99s investigation, both of which are serious,â\\x80\\x9d said one of the U.S. officials familiar with the information Nunes subpoenaed. Committee aides complained Nunes had acted unilaterally, and the top Democrat on the panel, Representative Adam Schiff, said Nunesâ\\x80\\x99 actions violated his earlier decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Democratic Representative Jackie Speier said it appeared that Nunes was â\\x80\\x9cmore concerned with pushing the White House narrative than seeking the truth.â\\x80\\x9d  Trump on Thursday renewed his allegation, without citing evidence, that his campaign communications were monitored, saying in a tweet: â\\x80\\x9cThe big story is the â\\x80\\x98unmasking and surveillanceâ\\x80\\x99 of people that took place during the Obama administration.â\\x80\\x9d Nunes followed suit hours later, tweeting: â\\x80\\x9cSeeing a lot of fake news from media elites and others who have no interest in violations of Americansâ\\x80\\x99 civil liberties via unmaskings.â\\x80\\x9d The names of U.S. citizens mentioned in foreign communications intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies are normally redacted, or â\\x80\\x9cmasked,â\\x80\\x9d in intelligence reports. The requests to unmask the names of Trump associates underwent the same stringent evaluations that U.S. privacy laws and intelligence regulations require for all such applications, and they produced nothing out of the ordinary, said the four officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. At most, only one of the requests related to Russia in any way, and the rest pertained to other countries, two of them said. The requests involved between 30 and 40 top-secret reports on intercepted communications in which foreign officials outside the United States mentioned the Trump campaign and people involved in it, the officials said. The reports contained no evidence that any Americans were targets of U.S. eavesdropping operations, they said. Russia has repeatedly denied any effort to interfere in the U.S. election, but Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday some Russians might have acted on their own without their governmentâ\\x80\\x99s involvement. Trump has denied any collusion between Russia and his campaign. He has repeatedly questioned the U.S. intelligence finding that Putin directed an operation that included computer hacking, fake news and propaganda intended to swing the election in Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s favor against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.

       " 'ROME (Reuters) - The Italian parliament approved the government s latest economic forecasts on Wednesday, but the Senate vote exposed deep divisions on the political left that could complicate the drafting of the 2018 budget. Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni s coalition won two votes in the upper house on the Treasury s Economic and Financial Document (DEF), even though parliamentarians with the leftist Mdp party walked out of one of the ballots. The Mdp was formed earlier this year following a schism in the Democratic Party (PD), with a small group of left-wingers accusing PD leader Matteo Renzi of shifting the ruling party too far to the right and shunning its Socialist roots. National elections are due in early 2018, and political jockeying is on the increase as Italy s myriad parties seek to establish clearly defined identities ahead of the vote. The Mdp, backed by former prime minister Massimo D Alema, is particularly anxious to put clear water between itself and Renzi s PD, seizing on the DEF to push its demands for more money to be spent on health care and job creation.  We have sent a political signal,  said Mdp senator Federico Fornaro. Gentiloni, who does not have a clearly defined majority in the upper house, was saved any embarrassment thanks to the backing of 12 Senators from the center-right ALA group, which is headed by Denis Verdini, previously close to former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Centre-left politicians said the Mdp was trying to smear Renzi by portraying him as a rightwinger.  The question of relations between the Mdp and the government is tied to its competition with the PD ahead of the elections,  said senior centrist politician Mario Catania.  The point is that the Mdp is following D Alema s line and pushing for the downfall of Renzi.  The government has to present its budget by Oct. 20, giving parliament until the end of the year to approve the package in what could be the last major act of the legislature. Gentiloni hopes to get the backing of the Mdp to guarantee smooth passage through both houses. The DEF hiked the 2018 growth forecast to 1.5 percent from a previous target of 1.0 percent, giving the Treasury room to present a more expansive budget than originally expected.  The health system is an area where we will weigh up measures to improve it and make it more efficient,  Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan told the Senate on Wednesday in an apparent nod to Mdp demands.

       " 'A dependable   handgun can be a literal lifesaver not just for the wealthy, but for Americans of all socioeconomic classes. For that reason, Breitbart News presents a list of six   guns that people may purchase for less than $350. [Some of the guns on the list are semiautomatics, which means they hold bullets in a detachable magazine and fire one round every time someone pulls the trigger. The other guns on the list are revolvers, which hold bullets in a cylinder that cycles and fires one bullet each time the user pulls the trigger.  Any of the guns on the list could be used to defend a life:    : The     is a 9mm semiautomatic that holds ten rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber for a total of 11 rounds. The gun has no external safety and is double action only. The firing mechanism creates a longer trigger pull â\\x80\\x94  which is a   in and of itself â\\x80\\x94  making accidental discharges more difficult. The   weighs 14 ounces, which is light enough for comfortable, everyday carry. Approximate price for a     is $ $320.   Ruger LCP: The Ruger LCP is a semiautomatic handgun chambered in . 380 and one of the most popular handguns on the market. It weighs in at 9. 6 ounces and holds six rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber, for a total of seven rounds. Like the     the Ruger has no external safety mechanism. Rather, it has the long    trigger pull that helps prevent accidental discharges. The LCP is a durable gun in a slightly smaller caliber than the   which may make the LCP a better choice for women or anyone looking for reduced recoil. Approximate price for a Ruger LCP is $ $270.    Taurus PT 738: The Taurus PT 738 is a lightweight polymer carry gun chambered in . 380. It holds six rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber, for a total of seven rounds. The PT 738 weighs in at 10. 2 ounces, which makes it comfortable for daily carry, even in lightweight clothing. The PT 738 has no external safety.

It holds seven rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber, for a total of eight rounds. The   only weighs 6. 6 ounces, and that light weight makes it ultra comfortable for daily carry. For about $15, one can purchase a clip that affixes to the side of the   and slides over the top of a boot, where it holds the gun against the calf and at the ready should trouble strike, or one can clip it on top of a pair of pants by the belt. The light weight, small size of the   makes it a great gun for purse carry, too. If carried in a purse, it should still be placed in a holster so the holster can prevent the trigger from snagging on something that might lead to an accidental discharge.

At 21 ounces, it is slightly heavier than some of the guns on this list and much heavier than others, but it has two strong points in its favor: 1. Dependability. 2. Stopping power. The Taurus 85 is a great revolver for a man or a woman, as the weight of the gun makes the recoil of . 38 Special ammunition manageable. For anyone wondering how heavy 21 ounces would feel for daily carry, a Glock 19 weighs just over 23 ounces, and it is one of the most popular carry guns ever.

The owner also needs to shoot it enough to become familiar with it, to know where bullets will go if he has to shoot it under duress. And he must familiarize himself with the laws of his state so he understands when it is legal to shoot and when it is not. When these steps are complete, he can own the gun with confidence, knowing he has done what is necessary to be ready if he needs to defend his life or the lives of his family members.

       " 'BEIRUT, Lebanon  â\\x80\\x94   Warplanes resumed airstrikes on the besieged   sections of Aleppo, Syria, on Tuesday, as Russia began a major new offensive against insurgents battling Syriaâ\\x80\\x99s president, Bashar  . Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, said it had started â\\x80\\x9ca big operation to deliver massive strikesâ\\x80\\x9d against the Islamic State and the Levant Victory Front, formerly known as the Nusra Front, in Idlib and Homs Provinces. Jets taking off from Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, conducted their first strikes on Syria, the Russian military said, noting that its forces were hitting targets in the two provinces. It was unclear whether the strikes on Aleppo were by Russian or Syrian government warplanes. The fighting shattered the relative calm that had prevailed in the   eastern parts of Aleppo for about three weeks. â\\x80\\x9cOur house is being shaken,â\\x80\\x9d Modar Sheikho, a nurse and antigovernment activist in   Aleppo, said in a text message. â\\x80\\x9cThe warplane is still in the sky. â\\x80\\x9d He shared an audio recording with the roar of a plane and the sound of explosions. Residents reported airstrikes on at least five Aleppo neighborhoods. The extent of the casualties was unclear, but they appeared to include at least three civilians, including a woman, who were killed in the neighborhood of Masaken Hanano, and 10 others who were wounded. There were conflicting reports about whether the attack had consisted of barrel bombs, which are usually dropped from helicopters, or an assault by fighter jets. â\\x80\\x9cSince this morning, until now, dozens of shells and rockets have bombed Aleppo,â\\x80\\x9d Mohammad   a resident of eastern Aleppo, said in a text message, adding that he believed the planes were Russian fighter jets. Mr. Shoigu, at a meeting in Sochi, Russia, with President Vladimir V. Putin, said that a Russian warship, the Admiral Grigorovich, was taking part in this operation, launching cruise missiles against insurgent targets. â\\x80\\x9cFor the first time in the history of Russian Navy, the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier took part in combat, too,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cToday, our   fighter jets began to work from this warship. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Shoigu also briefed Mr. Putin on what he called the use of chemical weapons by the insurgents. The Russian military said that chemical weapons used by insurgents had caused three deaths of Syrian soldiers, and the hospitalization of dozens of soldiers. On Monday, a Russian fighter jet crashed off the Syrian coast as it tried to return to the Admiral Kuznetsov. The pilot ejected safely, and the Russian Defense Ministry blamed a technical failure. The fighting broke out a day after Mr. Putin spoke to   Donald J. Trump and agreed to cooperate on fighting â\\x80\\x9cinternational terrorism and extremism,â\\x80\\x9d according to a Kremlin statement. That declaration echoed Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s recent comments that he would try to work with Moscow and with Mr. Assad to fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s comments concerning Syria also received a favorable reaction on Tuesday from the United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura. â\\x80\\x9cWhat heâ\\x80\\x99s been saying is quite interesting,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. de Mistura said, speaking on the BBCâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cHardtalkâ\\x80\\x9d program. â\\x80\\x9cThe focus, the priority, is Daesh, fighting terrorism. Second to do, if possible, a deal with Russia. Both points make a lot of sense. â\\x80\\x9d The diplomat said he had yet to speak directly to Mr. Trump or his associates. He also emphasized that in his view, the Syria conflict still required â\\x80\\x9ca completely new approach to what is a political solution. â\\x80\\x9d The Syrian government has tended to call all its opponents terrorists, and Russia makes little distinction among the different groups fighting Mr. Assad. A constant sticking point has been that some of the rebels that the United States has supported have made battlefield alliances with   groups considered terrorists by Moscow and Washington alike. Mr. de Mistura has estimated that perhaps a few hundred of the 10, 000 or so fighters inside besieged eastern Aleppo are affiliated with Al Qaeda rebels say that number is lower and the government says it is higher. The Obama administration has said that fighting the Islamic State is the priority of the United States, not toppling Mr. Assad  â\\x80\\x94   though that is another stated American aim. Under Mr. Obama, the United States government has continued to support some rebel groups that Washington deems not to be extremist, and it has shunned direct cooperation with Moscow and Damascus, contending that their campaign in Syria has been focused less on defeating extremists and more on battling opposition groups fighting Mr. Assad. The Obama administration has also condemned what it says is indiscriminate bombing by the Syrian government and its Russian allies. A change in American policy under Mr. Trump, who is to take office in January, could involve a shift toward direct cooperation with Mr. Assad and with Russia against the Islamic State.',\n",

That s probably more true of right-wing gun nuts than anything since the nuttier part of the right loves any excuse to shoot off their firearms.The Pasco County Sheriff s Department, concerned that idiots might actually try this, tweeted the following in response to the interest in the event:To clarify, DO NOT shoot weapons @ #Irma. You won t make it turn around & it will have very dangerous side effectshttps://t.co/CV4Y9OJknv  Pasco Sheriff (@PascoSheriff) September 10, 2017It s a tiny bit like firing your weapon straight into the air.

       " 'Until November 8, Democrats desperately tried to dismiss the prediction of presidential historian Allan Lichtman, who has accurately predicted every presidential election for the last 30 years. Unfortunately, it turned out polls were wrong and he was completely right.Lichtman has a second part to his prediction, though. While he accurately called the fact that Trump would win the White House, he s now predicting that he will just as quickly lose it through impeachment.While his electoral prediction was based on a scientific system, his latest prediction is not. It s a gut call, but let s call his an educated gut. His main argument is the baggage that Trump is carrying with him to the Oval Office. But it has a few reasons behind it. What you see [with Trump] is what you get: candidates don t fundamentally change. Donald Trump throughout his life has played fast and loose with the law. He was found by the justice department in the seventies to have discriminated against African Americans with his real estate business. This video is a couple of days old, so Lichtman didn t know that Trump would be settling the Trump University fraud case that s been hanging over his head, but that s far from the only scandal. While that alleged victim in the child rape case dropped the charges, Gloria Allred, the alleged victim s attorney, said the story isn t over yet.All of this, though, might just be an excuse to get rid of Trump. Trump is a wildcard and if there s anything Republicans can t stand, it s unpredictable behavior. Republicans love control and they would love to see Mike Pence, the vice president, as president because he is predictable and controllable. Pence is anti-choice and anti-gay. Trump keeps changing his opinions on those issues. That type of moral uncertainty doesn t sit well with the  ber religious Republican Party.Here s the video:Of course, if Trump is impeached, that would leave us with a President Pence.

       " 'MOSCOW  â\\x80\\x94   First, two television reporters vanished. Then a waiter went missing. Over the past week, men ranging in age from 16 to 50 have disappeared from the streets of Chechnya. On Saturday, a leading Russian opposition newspaper confirmed a story already circulating among human rights activists: The Chechen authorities were arresting and killing gay men. While abuses by security services in the region, where Russia fought a   war against Islamic insurgents, have long been a stain on President Vladimir V. Putinâ\\x80\\x99s human rights record, gay people had not previously been targeted on a wide scale. The men were detained â\\x80\\x9cin connection with their nontraditional sexual orientation, or suspicion of such,â\\x80\\x9d the newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, reported, citing Russian federal law enforcement officials, who blamed the local authorities. By Saturday, the paper reported, and an analyst of the region with her own sources confirmed, that more than 100 gay men had been detained. The newspaper had the names of three murder victims, and suspected many others had died in extrajudicial killings. A spokesman for Chechnyaâ\\x80\\x99s leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, denied the report in a statement to Interfax on Saturday, calling the article â\\x80\\x9cabsolute lies and disinformation. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou cannot arrest or repress people who just donâ\\x80\\x99t exist in the republic,â\\x80\\x9d the spokesman, Alvi Karimov, told the news agency. â\\x80\\x9cIf such people existed in Chechnya, law enforcement would not have to worry about them, as their own relatives would have sent them to where they could never return,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Karimov said. The sweep, like so much else in Russian politics today, was entangled in the countryâ\\x80\\x99s troubled politics of street activism. It began, Novaya Gazeta reported, after a   gay rights group, GayRussia. ru, applied for permits to stage gay pride parades in four cities in Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s predominantly Muslim North Caucasus region, of which Chechnya is a part. The group had not focused on the Muslim areas. It had been applying for permits for gay parades in provincial cities around Russia, and collecting the inevitable denials, in order to build a case about gay rights and freedom of assembly with the European Court of Human Rights, in Strasbourg, France. It had applied to more than 90 municipal governments. Nikolai Alekseev, a gay rights activist coordinating this effort, told Novaya Gazeta he had chosen this tactic rather than staging risky, unsanctioned gay parades. The group had not applied for a permit in Chechnya, but in another Muslim region in southern Russia,  . The mere application there  â\\x80\\x94   denied, as usual  â\\x80\\x94   had prompted an   counterdemonstration. In the restive Muslim regions, Mr. Putin has empowered local leaders to press agendas of traditional Muslim values, to   an Islamist underground. The gay pride parade applications became a galvanizing issue. â\\x80\\x9cIn Chechnya, the command was given for a â\\x80\\x98prophylactic sweepâ\\x80\\x99 and it went as far as real murders,â\\x80\\x9d Novaya Gazeta reported. According to the report, the authorities set to finding and arresting closeted gay men, partly by posing as men looking for dates on social networking sites. â\\x80\\x9cOf course, none of these people in any way demonstrated their sexual orientation publicly  â\\x80\\x94   in the Caucasus, this is equal to a death sentence,â\\x80\\x9d the newspaper wrote of those detained in the sweep. â\\x80\\x9cI got numerous, numerous signals,â\\x80\\x9d about the sweep of gay men, said Ekaterina L. Sokiryanskaya, Russia project coordinator for the International Crisis Group, and an authority on the North Caucasus. â\\x80\\x9cIt came from too many sources not to be true. â\\x80\\x9d Gay men have begun deleting online accounts, or fleeing the region. One user of Vkontakte, a Russian social networking site, wrote that a    boy had been detained in a village in Chechnya. He returned days later, according to the post, â\\x80\\x9call beaten, just a sack with bones. â\\x80\\x9d The newspaper published contact information to aid men wanting to leave Chechnya for relatively more tolerant parts of Russia. But reaching communities of closeted gay men in the remote mountain region poses challenges. â\\x80\\x9cEven delivering the information is very difficult,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Sokiryanskaya, who is familiar with the aid effort, said. â\\x80\\x9cThey are just small islands, isolated. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Trump speaks like a third grader. Trump rarely utters a word that isn t in the 850 words included in the Basic English language. A politician s ability to inspire voters is an important part of being a great leader. Then again, Trump isn t actually a politician. He s a billionaire has-been reality TV star.Then again, Trump is speaking to his supporters, who have been shown to have a similar grasp of the English language.No president is perfect and that includes President Obama. However, he has consistently proven that when he talks he sounds like he is the only adult in the room. Part of that reason is his ability to speak with passion. It also helps that he has reason backing his message. When he has something to say, people listen. That s part of the reason he was elected president twice. As the then Senator Obama said on the night of his first primary election  They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose.

       " 'PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s government has raised the possibility that the main opposition party could be ruled out of elections if it does not replace its leader, Kem Sokha, who has been charged with treason. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) has said it will not replace its leader and the comments reinforced its fears that Prime Minister Hun Sen plans to cripple it before next year s elections. The arrest of Kem Sokha on Sunday drew Western condemnation and marked an escalation in a crackdown on critics of Hun Sen, who has ruled for 30 years and could face possibly his toughest electoral challenge from the CNRP next year.  They have to appoint an acting president,  government spokesman Phay Siphan told Reuters on Tuesday.  If they don t comply with the law, they will not exist and have no right to political activity... It s their choice, not my choice.  Kem Sokha s daughter, Kem Monovithya, who is also a party official, said the party would not appoint a new leader. Kem Sokha was only named in February after his predecessor resigned in fear the party would be banned if he stayed on.  The ruling party can drop their divide-and-conquer plan now,  she said. Opposition officials accuse Hun Sen of trying to weaken or destroy the party ahead of the election, after it did well in June local elections, in which it nonetheless came well behind Hun Sen s Cambodia People s Party. Hun Sen, one of Asia s longest serving rulers, said on Wednesday there could be more arrests after  the act of treason  and it had reinforced the need for him to stay in office.  I ve decided to continue my work - not less than 10 years more,  he told garment factory workers, jabbing his finger in the air for emphasis. Kem Sokha became leader after opposition veteran Sam Rainsy resigned because of a new law that forbids any party having a leader who is found guilty of a crime. Sam Rainsy fled into exile to avoid a defamation conviction he says was political. Cambodian law says a political party has 90 days to replace a president if he or she dies, resigns or is convicted of an offence. Western countries have condemned the arrest of Kem Sokha and a crackdown on critics of Hun Sen, including independent media.  We don t care about people outside,  Phay Siphan said.  We care about our national security. We don t belong to anyone.  China, Hun Sen s close ally, has voiced support for Cambodia on steps to ensure its security. Kem Sokha was formally charged with treason on Tuesday. His lawyers have dismissed the evidence presented against him so far - a video publicly available since 2013 - in which he tells supporters he is getting support and advice from Americans for the campaign to win elections.      The government and the ruling CPP have manufactured these treason charges against Kem Sokha for political purposes, aiming to try and knock the political opposition out of the ring before the 2018 electoral contest even begins,  said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch.

       " 'BNEI BRAK, Israel (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews crammed into the streets of a Tel Aviv suburb on Tuesday to mourn a 104-year-old rabbi who had significantly influenced a succession of Israeli coalition governments. Rabbi Aharon Yehuda Leib Shteinman led a council of sages that controlled the small Degel Hatorah lawmakers  faction, part of the United Torah Judaism party, which has often held the balance of power in Israel. In particular, Shteinman broke with tradition by giving tacit consent to the enlistment of religious soldiers in the first ultra-Orthodox unit set up by the Israeli military. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government includes ultra-Orthodox political parties, said the Jewish people had  lost a central beacon of spirit, heritage and morality . Special buses and trains ferried mourners to Bnei Brak, a religious town on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Police estimated that several hundred thousand people gathered for the funeral procession, dressed in traditional black ultra-Orthodox garb. Shteinman, born in what is now Belarus, had led his community of Lithuanian-rooted ultra-Orthodox Jews since 2012. ',\n",

His tales of being held at gunpoint couldn t be verified by anyone. The only thing Carson has ever said that seems even remotely true is that he often felt like the  dumb kid  in class. He likes to follow it up with how he persevered and became a brain surgeon.Whatever it was that pushed Ben Carson through medical school and into a fellowship at one of the world s most prestigious hospitals was definitely not his ability to think on the fly. Left unscripted and with a microphone, Carson is his own worst enemy. That was never more obvious than it was at a recent campaign stop to talk to 5th-graders in Des Moines at the Isaac Newton Christian school.Apparently Carson was again trying to build on that old favorite  dumb kid  card when he turned into by far the dumbest person in the room. Without considering that he was dealing with 10-year-olds, Carson actually asked the class to point to the worst student among them. A Des Moines Register reporter tweeted that at least half a dozen kids in the class singled out one student:W/ crowd of 500 @RealBenCarson just called out to 5th grade class: who's dumbest kid in class? At least half dozen kids point to 1 student.  Timothy Meinch (@timeinch) January 7, 2016If you re a parent and that didn t absolutely infuriate you, you should have your idiot filter cleaned. In what universe is it OK to EVER degrade a child to make a political statement? The student said he wasn t upset by being singled out, which may make Carson feel better, but certainly not the kid s parents.Carson s numbers have been dwindling and it appears his campaign is nearing the end. Hopefully he drops his aspirations to de-throne George W Bush as the least qualified buffoon ever to occupy the Oval Office sooner than later before he causes any more damage.Featured image by Gage Skidmore\",\n",
       " 'UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States has proposed that the United Nations Security Council blacklist 10 ships for transporting banned items from North Korea, according to documents seen by Reuters on Tuesday. The vessels are accused of  conducting illegal ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels or illegally transporting North Korean coal to other countries for exports,  the United States said in its proposal. If none of the 15 members of the Security Council s North Korea sanctions committee object to the ships being designated by Thursday afternoon, the U.S. proposal will be approved.  Countries are required to ban blacklisted ships from entering their ports. Four ships were designated for carrying coal from North Korea by the council s North Korea sanctions committee in October. North Korea is under a U.N. arms embargo and the Security Council has banned trade in exports such as coal, textiles, seafood, iron and other minerals to choke funding for Pyongyang s missile and nuclear programs.  In September, the council put a cap of 2 million barrels a year on refined petroleum products exports to North Korea. The ships proposed to be blacklisted are: Xin Sheng Hai (flag unknown); Hong-Kong-flagged Lighthouse Winmore; Togo-flagged Yu Yuan; Panama-flagged Glory Hope 1 (also known as Orient Shenyu), Kai Xiang, and Billions No. 18; and North Korean-flagged Ul Ji Bong 6, Rung Ra 2, Rye Song Gang 1, and Sam Jong 2. Reclusive North Korea has boasted of developing a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and reaching the mainland United States in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and international condemnation. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday urged North Korea to carry out a  sustained cessation  of weapons testing to allow the two countries to hold talks. He did not specify how long the lull should last. North Korea conducted missile tests at a steady pace since April, then paused in September after firing a rocket that passed over Japan s Hokkaido island. But it renewed tests in November when it fired a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, which flew higher and further than previous tests. ',\n",

       " 'The majority of the country doesn t want Donald Trump as our president. A-list celebrities and even marching bands don t want to perform at his inauguration. And now, his former campaign manager and newest counselor Kellyanne Conway is finding out that private schools in the D.C. area don t want her kids either.Conway said on Wednesday that she is more  amused  than  worried  over the fact that none of the top notch schools in Washington want to accept her children. I would not characterize myself as  worried  so much as amused by the silence and sighs on the other end of the phone when friends and allies have made preliminary inquiries on my behalf,  Conway told the New York Post.Conway then pointed out that many of these schools tout diversity in their handbooks.  For some, there is comfort in sameness,  she noted. No wonder Trump likes her so much. If I were an admissions counselor I d shy away from this too, but I digress.Nobody with any sense wants to be associated with Trump or his transition team in any way, shape, or form. Conway is known as a talented spin doctor who now spends her days trying to explain why the horrible things that come out of Trump s mouth (or Twitter page) couldn t possibly be as abhorrent as they seem on the surface.Conway said she has been shocked by  the flood  of people who have offered to help her and her family with their move to D.C., but top schools apparently aren t so eager. According to the Post, a source close to Conway said that she is desperate and is asking everyone with connections to D.C. schools for help. Whether or nor real estate agents in Washington will want to work with her remains to be seen, as when asked about the matter she simply replied: First things first.

Less than one week ago, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said a regime change in Syria was  off the table . Now Tillerson is saying regime change is back on the table.

       " 'To hear conservatives, including those in the Republican presidential race, tell it, President Obama made America look weak by talking to Iran in order to get 10 detained U.S. sailors, rather than, say, immediately ordering carpet bombing of Tehran. Some right-wing media outlets were even more despondent. Breitbart, America s preeminent dumping ground of right-wing hysteria, devoted several articles to framing the incident as a humiliation for Obama.However, as much as conservatives would love to have this story be about Obama s weakness, the facts simply do not support that conclusion.For one thing, the entire duration was less than 24 hours. U.S. sailors had a GPS malfunction near the border of Iran. When they floated into that country s sovereign territory, they were picked up by Iranian military ships. By all accounts, they were treated well during their  captivity.  Secretary of State John Kerry worked tirelessly with the Iranian government, who sent them back with their boats the next day. No missiles were launched. No wars were started. No lives were lost.Getting no bloodshed, a perversely disappointed Republican Party were left instead to squabble over the details. At issue was whether Obama  apologized  to Iran for encroaching into their territory. This, Republicans said, was a serious blow to America s reputation. According to these warmongering blowhards, to apologize is to surrender.There are just two problems with this narrative: First, the Obama administration never apologized to Iran. And secondly, back in 2001, George W. Bush absolutely did apologize to another of America s economic foes, China, when he was faced with a similar situation. Nobody thought offering an apology was a sign of America s crumbling power when Bush did so.In April of 2001, 24 US Air Force members were  captured  by the Chinese government after crashing on a Chinese island. It was, without a doubt, a colossal screw up. America had been flying spy planes into China s territory, and one of those spy missions wound up crashing into a Chinese plane, killing the pilot. For 11 days, the U.S. soldiers were held in China while diplomats from both countries scrambled to figure out what to do. But then George W. Bush said he was sorry.The letter delivered today to China s foreign ministry by the US ambassador, Joseph Prueher, said Mr Bush and the secretary of state, Colin Powell, expressed  sincere regret  over the loss of the Chinese plane and the missing pilot, Mr Wang. Please convey to the Chinese people to the family of pilot Wang Wei that we are very sorry for their loss,  said the letter.The document letter appeared to be a complex linguistic compromise.A Chinese-language copy of the letter released by the US embassy did not use the term Chinese officials had insisted on    daoqian , a formal apology that admits blame.Even worse   if you re a writer for Breitbart   Bush went on to apologize for entering Chinese airspace. The same might be expected of Obama when two of America s ships entered Iranian waters.We are very sorry the entering of China s airspace and the landing did not have verbal clearance, but very pleased the crew landed safely. We appreciate China s efforts to see to the well-being of our crew.While the situation was extremely tense at the time, and although the Bush administration was reluctant to say  I m sorry,  they eventually backed down. (Note: The Bush administration would go on to repeatedly insist this apology was not an apology. Take that for what it s worth.) America didn t become the laughingstock of the world. Nobody felt like anyone had lost any respect. Instead, the two sides moved on. The American soldiers got to return home unharmed.As we ve seen time and again, the Republican Party, infuriated that they have no legs to stand on in complaining about Obama, create mountains out of molehills. A diplomatic issue that could have led to a very bad situation for 10 U.S. service members was resolved in less than 24 hours by two governments which strongly dislike each other and conservatives think that s what losing looks like. Are they crazy? No. Just extremely disingenuous.Or as the saying goes: There are lies, damned lies, and the right-wing media. Up is down. Cold is hot. And 10 soldiers getting to come home to their families safely is a  loss.  George W. Bush might want to have a talk with his colleagues.Featured image via Flickr',\n",
       " 'Progressive Nomad: Bernie Sanders Pens CRUCIAL Letter To The President (IMAGES) By Stephanie Kuklish on October 29, 2016 Subscribe \\nOn the heels of Thursdayâ\\x80\\x99s brutal attack on Native Americans peacefully protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline by local and state police officers, Senator Bernie Sanders has written an open letter to President Obama asking for him to stand up against this atrocity. \\nIn a message posted on Sanderâ\\x80\\x99s official U.S. Senate website, he asked for President Obama to halt construction of the pipeline until cultural and environmental reviews were done by trusted sources. Sanders wrote : â\\x80\\x9cIt is deeply distressing to me that the federal government is putting the profits of the oil industry ahead of the treaty and sovereign rights of Native American communities. Mr. President, you took a bold and principled stand against the Keystone pipeline â\\x80\\x93 I ask you to take a similar stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline. To my mind, the [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers] should have never approved this project on an expedited process in the first place.â\\x80\\x9d \\nSanders continued the letter by urging the President to send non-partial monitors to the camp in order to ensure that the water protectorâ\\x80\\x99s civil rights were being protected. He then reminded President Obama just how dangerous this pipeline, and others like it, can be for the environment. Sanders stated : â\\x80\\x9cAccording to one report, burning the oil transported through the pipeline would produce carbon emissions equivalent to 21 million cars or 30 coal plants. If we have any hope of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change, we should not be building new oil pipelines that lock us into burning fossil fuels for generations to come.â\\x80\\x9d \\nIt has been incredibly difficult to get media coverage on this event, and even when there is; everyone seems to turn a blind eye to what is going on in North Dakota. Police are once again lying about the protestors and taking very violent and forceful tactics against them, even though they are not armed and are showing little to no signs of violent actions. \\nAt some point this has got to end and either the President can make a stand or he may be addressing the nation apologizing for wasteful human deaths at the hands of our own police force.',\n",
       " 'Alynda Segarra knows what itâ\\x80\\x99s like to live between cultures. As a lonely teenager in the Bronx, she would regularly escape downtown, soaking up Latin poetry slams at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and hanging out with crusty punks in Tompkins Square Park. â\\x80\\x9cI always remember punk kids saying to me, â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99re not Puerto Rican, youâ\\x80\\x99re white,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Segarra said. â\\x80\\x9cAnd the Puerto Rican kids would say: â\\x80\\x98Who dresses like you? Who are you really? â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d The question stung because Ms. Segarra herself didnâ\\x80\\x99t know the answer. â\\x80\\x9cI hadnâ\\x80\\x99t internalized my heritage,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cI was still finding most of my heroes in white men, feeling like theyâ\\x80\\x99re the ones who make history. I believed what was shoved down my throat. â\\x80\\x9d The art she made reflected that view. Even deep into her 20s, as Ms. Segarra rose as a critically admired   on three albums released under the band name Hurray for the Riff Raff, she kept her lineage at bay. Instead, her music explored the blues and folk roots of Americana. Only last year, as she approached her 30th birthday, did Ms. Segarra confront her internalized cultural exile with the intent to reconcile the disparate strands of her identity. The results can be heard on her ambitious new work with the band due on Friday, â\\x80\\x9cThe Navigator,â\\x80\\x9d a    concept album that traces the wanderings of a character named Navita Milagros NegrÃ³n. Ms. Segarra fashioned the story as an imaginary Off Broadway play â\\x80\\x9cstarringâ\\x80\\x9d the musicians, â\\x80\\x9cdirected byâ\\x80\\x9d its producer and featuring a faux Playbill to guide listeners through. The music uses her contradictions to her advantage, mixing rock guitars with bomba rhythms, while melding original lyrics with some verse from the Puerto Rican poet Pedro Pietri. The songs connect the dots in a long history of Latin influences in popular music, from the   harmonies of   to Brill Building hits like â\\x80\\x9cSave the Last Dance for Me,â\\x80\\x9d to the   of Mink DeVille. On a recent winter afternoon, Ms. Segarra returned to the Nuyorican Poets Cafe to discuss her early alienation, framing it, in part, as a product of assimilation. When she was growing up, her mother, Ninfa Segarra, had a thriving career as an educator and a politician, rising to become the deputy mayor of New York under Rudolph W. Giuliani. Her father was a vice principal and a music teacher in the Bronx, where he taught the singer and actor Marc Anthony as a youth. The couple split when Ms. Segarra was a child, and she was reared mainly by her   aunt and uncle in Marble Hill. Ms. Segarraâ\\x80\\x99s father introduced her to the clave rhythms of   music, yet she gravitated more toward the videos of Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra beloved by her aunt and uncle. Puberty ignited in her a rebellious side, which found reflection in punk bands like the Dead Kennedys and Bikini Kill. â\\x80\\x9cI started to feel very angry about my place in the world as a girl,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Segarra said. â\\x80\\x9cI wanted to go wherever I wanted without fear of danger, to be treated the same as my brother. â\\x80\\x9d In high school, she formed an acoustic punk group with other young women, modeled on the music of the   singer Kimya Dawson. She also began to spend more time in the East Village, identifying with women who shaved their heads but not their armpits. Failing in school and feeling like a drain on her family, Ms. Segarra ran away from home to squat on the Lower East Side. â\\x80\\x9cI was really scared  â\\x80\\x94   and really hungry,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cBut I was determined to live the life of an artist that everyone said was impossible. â\\x80\\x9d Aching for experience and escape, Ms. Segarra took to the road, hopping trains until she finally ended up settling in New Orleans by her 18th birthday. There, she found street kids she connected with more deeply. Together, they began performing songs by Woody Guthrie, whose wanderings Ms. Segarraâ\\x80\\x99s own had echoed. She lived by busking, getting good enough at her craft to make home recordings that earned some buzz, starting with â\\x80\\x9cIt Donâ\\x80\\x99t Mean I Donâ\\x80\\x99t Love Youâ\\x80\\x9d (2008). In 2014, Ms. Segarra was signed to ATO Records for â\\x80\\x9cSmall Town Heroes,â\\x80\\x9d which proved a critical breakthrough. Yet she felt unsatisfied in her work. To focus, she moved to Nashville, where she didnâ\\x80\\x99t know anyone. â\\x80\\x9cI began to ask myself, â\\x80\\x98Who am I when everyone I know is gone? â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d she said. The answer manifested itself in â\\x80\\x9cThe Navigator. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Segarra felt   to simply mimic Latin rhythms for the album. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Ziggy Stardustâ\\x80\\x99 was a eureka moment,â\\x80\\x9d she said, referring to the intergalactic David Bowie album and alter ego. â\\x80\\x9cI learned I could create a character, the Navigator, who would stand at the intersection of all these identities and weave in and out. And I related to being the alien. I began to take that as a badge of honor. â\\x80\\x9d For musical role models, Ms. Segarra looked to earlier Latin artists heavily influenced by rock, like the Ghetto Brothers, a politically active Puerto Rican street gang turned band that recorded one album in 1971. She also looked to Rodriguez, whom she discovered from the documentary â\\x80\\x9cSearching for Sugarman. â\\x80\\x9d The albumâ\\x80\\x99s lyrics conform to rock rather than to theatrical music, favoring poetic abstractions over clear narrative. Themes of gentrification and cultural appropriation center the work, all boldly delivered by Ms. Segarraâ\\x80\\x99s billowing vibrato. Along the way, she gives a nod to the Young Lords, the Puerto Rican activist group of the â\\x80\\x9960s and â\\x80\\x9970s. In turn, Ms. Segarra finally took full ownership of her heritage. â\\x80\\x9cBefore, when I heard Latin sounds in popular music, I thought: That music belongs to everyone. Now I think: Oh, thatâ\\x80\\x99s the sound of where I came from. Look what we brought to the culture. Listen to what we added. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'KABUL (Reuters) - Spreading violence in Afghanistan is forcing many schools to close, undermining fragile gains in education for young girls in a war-ravaged country where millions of girls have never been to school, said a Human Rights Watch report released on Tuesday. After more than a decade and a half of international intervention in Afghanistan, corruption, insecurity, waste, and other problems mean around two-thirds of Afghan girls still do not go to school, the rights group said. Despite the challenges, millions of children have received education, but those gains are now threatened by spreading violence and declining international funding, the report found.  As security in the country has worsened, the progress made toward the goal of getting all girls into school may be heading in reverse   a decline in girls  education in Afghanistan,  the authors wrote.  In the most insecure areas of the country, schools are closing at an alarming rate due to insecurity.  While the war has affected schools since at least 2005,  as the fighting has escalated and spread to previously secure areas, more schools have closed . In Kandahar, for example, at least 130 of 435 schools were closed over the summer, a local government official told HRW. Threats from Islamic State militants forced the closure of at least 61 schools in the northern province of Jawzjan, education ministry spokesman Kabir Haqmal told Reuters.       He said he could not yet comment on the report s findings, but acknowledged that  Security has a great impact on education, and when there are challenges, fewer girls attend.  Access to education can be undermined by factors ranging from limited numbers of qualified teachers and community opposition to a lack of sanitary facilities. One of the more successful education programs is also one of the most threatened by a drop in international funds, the HRW report found. So-called  community-based education  (CBE) programs have helped expand access to schools in many areas, the researchers said. But such programs were only a temporary solution, as they were all run by non-profit groups out a shrinking pool of international donations, they said.  The absence of long-term strategic thinking by government and donors exposes CBE programs, and students, to unpredictable closures,  they added.  International aid has been essential to the progress in expanding access to education since 2001,  they concluded, but ranked bureaucratic hurdles, corruption, and insecurity among the reasons why the government often left the funds unspent.

       " 'ORLANDO, Fla.  â\\x80\\x94   For years, sports teams have tried to defray the   costs of their new stadiums by asking fans to pay thousands for personal seat licenses that entitle them to buy season tickets. FlÃ¡vio Augusto da Silva is taking the concept further. In what may be the first deal of its kind, Mr. da Silva, the majority owner of Orlando City of Major League Soccer, is asking investors from Brazil, China and elsewhere to pay $500, 000 each for a stake in the stadium he is building near downtown Orlando. In return, the foreign investors receive annual dividends, two season tickets and something even more valuable: a green card that allows them, their spouses and sometimes even their children to live and work in the United States. The visa offer is legal, and it uses a    federal program, known as   that is under renewed scrutiny in Congress. Created in 1990, the program was intended to help pay for infrastructure projects in rural areas and poor urban neighborhoods. After bank lending dried up in the last recession, developers turned to the program to finance hotels, condominiums and other projects from Manhattan to Miami. As a result, the number of   visas awarded grew to almost 9, 000 last year, from fewer than 100 in 2003. Mr. da Silva, though, is building a $156 million stadium, not a   building or a shopping mall, and he is marketing to foreigners not because lending is tight, but because lawmakers in Florida would not provide subsidies for the stadium in the Parramore neighborhood of Orlando. â\\x80\\x9cFor us, it was a business decision,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. da Silva, who expects to raise about half the construction cost through the    program. â\\x80\\x9cThere was already demand from people who want to move to the U. S. have a green card and have a good opportunity to participate in the growth of the club. â\\x80\\x9d Orlando Cityâ\\x80\\x99s use of the visa program, which was criticized by a leading Republican in March as â\\x80\\x9criddled with corruption and national security vulnerabilities,â\\x80\\x9d is a new approach for sports teams looking for ways to pay for stadiums without financial support from local communities, where officials are under pressure from voters opposed to using public money to help wealthy owners.   financing helped pay for infrastructure work connected to Barclays Center in Brooklyn, but not for the arena itself. Developers previously tried to use the   program to finance   projects in California, Florida and elsewhere, but they hit roadblocks, including the unpredictable pace of getting   investors approved for projects that often have to be opened on specific timelines. The Orlando project features a   stadium, scheduled to open for the 2017 seasons of both Orlando City S. C. and the Orlando Pride, the womenâ\\x80\\x99s team that Mr. da Silva owns with his partner Phil Rawlins. Originally, the city and county agreed to subsidize the project. But when state lawmakers balked at approving a sales tax rebate, Mr. da Silva turned to the   program, something Orlandoâ\\x80\\x99s mayor, Buddy Dyer, cheered. The teamâ\\x80\\x99s solution â\\x80\\x9cended up being a    for everybody,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Dyer said in his office near the 10.  building site, where the skeleton of the stadium is taking shape. â\\x80\\x9cWhat I tell other mayors is that Iâ\\x80\\x99m the happiest mayor in America, and I go through the whole litany, including soccer. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. da Silva knew about the   program because he obtained his own green card in 2009 by investing in a   project in Vermont. While the strongest demand for   visas is from China, Mr. da Silva, who made a fortune  â\\x80\\x94   his net worth was $444 million in 2014, according to Forbes Brasil  â\\x80\\x94   building a chain of   schools in his native Brazil, decided to single out his countrymen. Brazilians are   and some even follow Orlando City, whose games are broadcast in Brazil and who are led by KakÃ¡, a World Cup winner for Brazil and a former world player of the year. Mr. da Silvaâ\\x80\\x99s sales pitch has benefited from several years of political and economic turmoil in Brazil, where some of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s elite are rushing to move money offshore. The club said it had already attracted 30 investors, bringing in $15 million, or 10 percent of the projectâ\\x80\\x99s cost. Mr. Rawlins, the teamâ\\x80\\x99s founder and president, said about $5 million in new commitments is secured each month. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know why people havenâ\\x80\\x99t taken more advantage of it, because itâ\\x80\\x99s a perfect thing when youâ\\x80\\x99re building a stadium,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Rawlins said of the visa program. â\\x80\\x9cThe program is really about economic development. â\\x80\\x9d Mark Abbott, deputy commissioner of M. L. S. said the league had reviewed the financing proposal and found it â\\x80\\x9cinnovative. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe league doesnâ\\x80\\x99t permit this type of financing for clubs,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Abbott said, â\\x80\\x9cbut for stadium projects, we thought it was appropriate. â\\x80\\x9d In addition to their stakes in the company that runs the stadium, investors in the project receive two club seats for 10 seasons. (The investors have no control over the team itself, which is part of a separate company.) But Mr. da Silva and others did not dispute that the visas were the real draw. Using the   program, though, can be complicated because the construction site must be in an area with high unemployment. To qualify, boundaries are sometimes gerrymandered to create an economically challenged (but essentially manufactured) neighborhood. Developers also must spend millions of their own money to start the construction because it can take months and even years for the government to approve each   visa. Visa applicants must pass a background check and prove that the project is viable and will create at least 10 jobs for each visa issued. The visas can be made permanent after a   probationary period. Some financial advisers recommend that foreigners who are considering putting $500, 000 into a real estate project choose a hotel, mall or other more certain venture  â\\x80\\x94   anything but a sports stadium, whose main tenant could have unpredictable results. â\\x80\\x9cWhen these guys win games and championships, great, but if theyâ\\x80\\x99re not, that cash flow could change,â\\x80\\x9d said Michael Gibson, who helps foreigners invest in   projects. â\\x80\\x9cWhy invest in that when you can invest in something steadier?â\\x80\\x9d It is unclear how long other sports franchise owners will have the   program as a financing option. It is facing new questions on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are trying to close loopholes that allowed money to be steered from projects in needy areas toward wealthier districts. Some    projects have turned into boondoggles, producing little or no economic benefit. In other cases, foreign investors have accused developers of misspending their money and not paying promised returns. For now, opponents of the program have been unable to get the votes to overhaul or eliminate it, so other teams may be able to follow the path Orlando City has blazed. In M. L. S. alone, a group led by David Beckham, the former soccer star from England, has been trying to assemble a plan for a stadium in Miami, and the owners of teams in New York, Los Angeles and Washington are in various stages of the same process.',\n",

       " 'CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian authorities have detained 15 people pending an investigation into an attack on an unlicensed Coptic Christian church in a village south of Cairo, a security source said on Sunday. Dozens of Muslims from the village of Kafr al-Waslin attacked the church after Friday prayers, smashing the windows and breaking everything inside, the archdiocese of Atfih said in a statement. The diocese had applied to legalize the status of the church, which has housed worshippers for 15 years after a church building law was passed in 2016, the statement said. Those detained are accused of stirring sectarian strife, harming national unity and destroying private property, one judicial source told Reuters.  The owner of the building was also in custody pending inquiries into the operations of the facility by state security and the interior ministry, the source added. Egyptian Christians make up about a tenth of the country s almost 95 million population and are the Middle East s largest Christian community. They have long complained of discrimination in the majority-Muslim country. The government does not make the official number of Christians public in its census and Christians have long complained of being undercounted.

       " 'SAN FRANCISCO  â\\x80\\x94   In a major shift for online commerce, Amazon is quietly changing how it entices people to buy. The retailer built a reputation and hit $100 billion in annual revenue by offering deals. The first thing a potential customer saw was a bargain: how much an item was reduced from its list price. Now, in many cases, Amazon has dropped any mention of a list price. There is just one price. Take it or leave it. The new approach comes as discounts both online and offline have become the subject of dozens of consumer lawsuits for being much less than they seem. It is also occurring while Amazon is in the middle of an ambitious multiyear shift from a store selling one product at a time to a   ecosystem. Amazon wants to be so deeply embedded in a customerâ\\x80\\x99s life that buying happens as naturally as breathing, and nearly as often. â\\x80\\x9cWhen Amazon began 21 years ago, the strategy was to lose on every sale but make it up on volume,â\\x80\\x9d said Larry Compeau, a Clarkson University professor of consumer studies. â\\x80\\x9cIt was building for the future, and the future has arrived. Amazon doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have to seduce customers with a deal because theyâ\\x80\\x99re going to buy anyway. â\\x80\\x9d Or so Amazon hopes. Digital stores live by Alec Baldwinâ\\x80\\x99s maxim in â\\x80\\x9cGlengarry Glen Rossâ\\x80\\x9d: â\\x80\\x9cAlways be closing. â\\x80\\x9d The retailer has been experimenting with another method of closing a sale. It tells the potential buyer what the price used to be on Amazon. For example, Amazon originally promoted the Rave Turbo Chute as being discounted by 36 percent. Then, all mention of a discount was dropped and the   water slide was simply listed at $1, 573. 58, with an explanation that it used to be $1, 573. 59  â\\x80\\x94   one penny more. Then, it dropped the   price comparison. Then, it dropped the price to $1, 532. 01 and put the comparison back. â\\x80\\x9cThey still need to showcase deals, but the question is, How?â\\x80\\x9d said Michael Kovarik, who runs a     called Rout. That is why stores love big discounts: they work. In studies by Mr. Compeau and others, the perception of a deal is often what makes the purchase happen. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve been conditioned to buy only when things are on sale,â\\x80\\x9d said Bonnie Patten, executive director of TruthInAdvertising. org, a consumer information site. â\\x80\\x9cAs a result, what many retailers have done is make sure everything is always on sale. Which means nothing is ever on sale. â\\x80\\x9d Amazon has both benefited from that conditioning as well as encouraged it, which is most likely why it is changing cautiously. It began eliminating list prices about two months ago, pricing specialists say, both on products it sold itself and those sold by other merchants on its site. The retailer did not return multiple requests for comment. â\\x80\\x9cOur data suggests that list prices are going away,â\\x80\\x9d said Guru Hariharan, chief executive of Boomerang Commerce, a retail analytics firm. Last spring, Boomerang compiled a list for The New York Times of 100 pet food products that Amazon said it was selling at a discount to a list price. Only about half of them still say that. â\\x80\\x9cAmazon is a   company with very few sacred cows,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hariharan said. â\\x80\\x9cAt the very least, it is conducting a storewide test about whether it should change its pricing strategy. â\\x80\\x9d With a majority of Amazon products, the presentation of a bargain used to be front and center. Take, for example, the Breville Infuser Espresso Machine. A few months ago, Amazon said this was an $800 machine that it was offering for $500, a discount of 38 percent. Two articles in The Times earlier this year on the problems with online list prices drew on a randomly assembled list of 47 discounted housewares, leisure and other products on Amazon, including the Breville Infuser. Over the Fourth of July weekend, the list price was gone for 39 of those products. The Infuser page, for instance, simply said what it would cost to buy at that moment, which was $483. Nineteen of the product pages tried to encourage a sale by pointing out that the price used to be higher on Amazon, although no time period was given. â\\x80\\x9cAmazon is showing it can fix the problem if it wants to,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Patten said. The problem with list prices or, as they are sometimes called, manufacturersâ\\x80\\x99 suggested retail prices, is that they are regularly more of a marketing concept than what anyone is actually charging. When Amazon was saying the list price of the Breville Infuser was $800, Breville itself was selling the machine for $500  â\\x80\\x94   about the same as Amazon. Other retailers sell it for $500, too. Breville confirmed the price was $500. Bargains online and offline that are not real bargains are breeding legal action, much of it using a tough California law against deceptive advertising. New cases have been filed in the last few months against Macyâ\\x80\\x99s, J. Crew, Gymboree, Ann Taylor, Ralph Lauren and the website Wines â\\x80\\x99Til Sold Out, according to TruthInAdvertising. org.   cases were filed in the first six months of 2016, nearly as many as the 25 in all of 2015. There have been at least 10 settlements. In April, a Los Angeles judge gave preliminary approval to a $6 million offer by Kohlâ\\x80\\x99s Department Stores. That deal came on the heels of a $50 million preliminary settlement by J. C. Penney. Amazon itself was the target of a   suit  â\\x80\\x94   an unexpected development, because all Amazon customers agree to go to arbitration instead of court. A judge dismissed the complaint but the plaintiffs are now appealing, saying the arbitration clause is â\\x80\\x9cunconscionableâ\\x80\\x9d and should be invalidated. Amazon declined to comment on the suit. The shift away from list prices is taking some merchants on Amazon by surprise. A seller named Travis complained in an Amazon forum that the list price on his product  â\\x80\\x94   which he did not identify  â\\x80\\x94   had disappeared from the site. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m well aware that it is bogus but it is a common marketing tactic that works very well at boosting sales,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote. Amazon also appears to have stepped up its monitoring of a vendor system that allowed some sellers to insert data that listed their products as 99 percent or even 100 percent off. Another Amazon seller who complained that his list prices were not showing up said he was told by the retailer that it was routinely checking list prices on other sites. Mr. Kovarik of Rout said his analysis indicated that Amazon was regularly eliminating more list prices. â\\x80\\x9cIn early May, about 29 percent of the products we saw were missing list prices, but now the number is up to about 70 percent,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Amazon has always focused on driving revenue while disregarding profits. That had many implications: It was driven to try new things it could undercut any competitor who focused on price it could literally buy customer loyalty. In Amazonâ\\x80\\x99s third decade, with its complete domination of the   landscape, there are signs it is beginning to emphasize the value each customer brings. â\\x80\\x9cThey are trying to figure out what product categories have customers who are so tied into the Amazon ecosystem that list prices are no longer necessary,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Compeau, of Clarkson, said. In some categories, like groceries, Amazon seems to be using just one price, the    price. If Amazon brings the milk and music into your house, not to mention videos and   and the devices to consume them on, as well as a hot dinner and just about any other object you could want, that presents a pricing challenge of a different sort. Untangling what those deals are worth  â\\x80\\x94   as opposed to what they cost  â\\x80\\x94   is probably impossible. â\\x80\\x9cTwenty years ago, we were hesitant to trust online companies with our credit card information,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Compeau observed. â\\x80\\x9cNow weâ\\x80\\x99re being asked to trust them completely. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Senateâ\\x80\\x99s Armed Services Committee, John McCain, has proposed $7.5 billion of new military funding for U.S. forces and their allies in the Asia-Pacific, where tensions have been rising over Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s territorial ambitions. The funds, $1.5 billion a year for five years to 2022, could be used to boost U.S. munitions stocks in the region, build new military infrastructure, such as runways, and to help allies and partner countries increase their capabilities, an aide to McCain and a U.S. military official said. The funding proposal was contained in a White Paper issued by McCain last week entitled â\\x80\\x9cRestoring American Power.â\\x80\\x9d His committee is expected to discuss it at a budget hearing on Tuesday. â\\x80\\x9cSenator McCain believes the United States must sustain its enduring commitment to the security and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region,â\\x80\\x9d a spokesman for McCain, Dustin Walker, said.  â\\x80\\x9cThe Asia-Pacific Stability Initiative ... would ... make U.S. regional posture more forward-learning, flexible, resilient, and formidable,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThese funds would boost operational military construction, increase munitions procurement, enhance capacity building with allies and partners, and expand military exercises and other training activities.â\\x80\\x9d An official in the administration of new U.S. President Donald Trump, who took office on Friday, said he believed McCainâ\\x80\\x99s proposal was â\\x80\\x9cvery much in general alignment with the administrationâ\\x80\\x99s goals in the region.â\\x80\\x9d  Trump has vowed to take a tougher line with China and to build up the U.S. military, although it is unclear whether he will succeed in lifting caps on defense spending that have been part of â\\x80\\x9csequestrationâ\\x80\\x9d legislation. A U.S. military official, who did not want to be identified, said the funds could go to construct new military runways in countries such as Australia and the Philippines and to make up a shortfall of munitions that the head of the U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, complained of last year. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a shortfall in the total number of munitions and also a quality gap,â\\x80\\x9d the official said, adding that more sophisticated missiles were needed in the region to counter Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9canti-access, area-denialâ\\x80\\x9d strategy.  On Monday, the new U.S. administration raised the prospect of worsening tensions with China when it vowed to prevent Beijing from taking over territory in international waters in the South China Sea, something Chinese state media has warned would require Washington to â\\x80\\x9cwage war.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",

       " 'Misogynist blogger Daryush Valizadeh, better known as Roosh V., owner and operator of the He-Man Woman Haters site  Return of Kings,  is finally getting his comeuppance. Roosh had organized an  International Tribal Meetup Day,  for men like himself who believe that women are nothing more than property, and therefore rape should completely legal on private property. Some of the meetings of the rape supporting men were to take place in Seattle and Everett, Washington   that is until the public got wind of this douchebag s plans.Outrage quickly ensued, and rightfully so. Here are just a few of the tweets from citizens calling for Roosh s blood:This is sickening. @SPLBuzz a heads up~ \\'Pro-rape\\' blogger organizes meetings for men across U.S.Seattle https://t.co/caQ8OJraUd via Q13FOX  Jasmine Boothroyd (@jazzvictoria) February 3, 2016Seriously.

Because no one else is. #fem2 #humanrights pic.twitter.com/r7p386Vi8Q  Jon Hutson (@JonHutson) February 2, 2016And that is just the tip of the iceberg. There has also been a Whitehouse.gov petition to classify Return of Kings group as a terrorist organization. There was even a safety alert posted to social media by local police warning women to steer clear, and saying that there is concern that this may be a ruse to commit rape. Even heavily conservative Texas Governor Greg Abbott has come out in strong condemnation against the group when he learned of their plans to hold meetings in Texas, saying in a statement: This pathetic group and their disgusting viewpoints are not welcome in Texas. I ve spent much of my career protecting women from such vile and heinous acts, and it won t be any different on my watch as Governor. After the outrage continued, Roosh V. finally released the following statement, announcing the cancellation of all of the meetups: I can no longer guarantee the safety or privacy of the men who want to attend on February 6, especially since most of the meetups can not be made private in time. While I can t stop men who want to continue meeting in private groups, there will be no official Return Of Kings meetups. The listing page has been scrubbed of all locations. I apologize to all the supporters who are let down by my decision. While your fellow misogynists may be let down, Roosh, the rest of the world is breathing a collective sigh of relief. You should be locked up with the key thrown away, for advocating the commission and legalization of a heinous violent crime. You are nothing more than a misogynist hate group leader, and I, for one, am glad the sane people of the world spoke out and made sure that you d be too afraid to continue doing what you do.Watch a video news report below, via DFW CBS below:Featured image from Change.org',\n",

       " 'On June 15, 2016, President Trump warned Americans that we were  witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history-led by some very bad and conflicted people! You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history   led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2017Boy, was Trump ever correct!GP   Robert Mueller continued with his now widely reported corrupt and criminal activities last night by leaking information sealed by the courts to CNN. This is just another corrupt and criminal act in Mueller s corrupt and criminal career.Last night we found out from information leaked to CNN that the Mueller investigation has filed charges in the ongoing superfluous investigation into President Trump and the far out possibility that he colluded with Russia in the 2016 election. CNN reported that:A federal grand jury in Washington, DC, on Friday approved the first charges in the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller, according to sources briefed on the matter. The charges are still sealed under orders from a federal judge.In typical bad cop form, former FBI Head and current Special Counsel Mueller proved again that he is as dirty as it gets.Trump came out today after the crooked deep-state with these series of tweets:Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?), .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017 the Uranium to Russia deal, the 33,000 plus deleted Emails, the Comey fix and so much more. Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia, .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017 \"collusion,\" which doesn\\'t exist. The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the R\\'s  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017 are now fighting back like never before. There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out. DO SOMETHING!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017Finally, President Trump insinuates that this phony Russian collusion talk is coming out as a distraction,  when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts and Reform. Is this coincidental? NOT! All of this \"Russia\" talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform. Is this coincidental? NOT!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017Mueller s career is littered with numerous investigations of major scandals and likely crimes that he did not meaningfully investigate as FBI Director resulting in no arrests and no consequences. All of these resulted in the Clintons and/or Obama Administration getting away with criminal activities:IRS Targeting (2010-2013): the IRS intentionally selected and then delayed or denied tax-exempt 501(c)(3) applications from conservative groups to prevent them from participating in the 2012 election, followed by IRS agent Lois Lerner invoking her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. (No charges have been filed of any wrong doing by any government officials in this case.)Fast and Furious (2010): this ATF program, which seems to have served no rational purpose, allowed over 2,000 guns to be purchased illegally inside the United States and then  walked  into Mexico for use by criminals, one of which was later used in the 2010 murder of Border Agent Brian Terry by the member of a Mexican cartelAssociated Press Spying (2012): the Department of Justice illegally seized the communications of AP reporters made during April and May 2012, allowing the DOJ to unmask journalists  confidential sourcesClinton Foundation Pay-for-Play (2009-2013): during the period in which Hillary Clinton held the office of Secretary of State, the Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton received millions of dollars in paid speaking fees and a million dollar  gift from countries involved in matters with the State Department, many of which had ties to terrorism and human rights abuses; some of these funds were apparently diverted from charitable causes to personal expenses, such as Chelsea Clinton s 2010 wedding.Russian Uranium Deal (2009-2013): Hillary Clinton s State Department approved a deal allowing a Russian company to control 20% of the uranium mining production capacity inside the United States, which was followed by millions of dollars in donations to the Clinton Foundation from people associated with the transaction. This past week information was reported that prior to the Obama administration approving the very controversial deal in 2010 giving Russia 20% of America s Uranium through the approved sale of Uranium One, the FBI had evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were involved in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering in order to benefit Vladimir Putin, says a report by The Hill. Mueller was the head of the FBI at this time! He was even hand picked by Hillary Clinton to hand over uranium to Russia on an airport tarmac at this time.Clinton Private Email Server (2009-2013): during her entire tenure as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton dodged Freedom of Information Act requirements by using a private email server to conduct official government business, as well as sent and received classified information that was Top Secret over an unsecured system an  extremely reckless  (and obviously illegal) act. Mueller s acceptance of the lead role in the investigation into Russia is another obvious example of his corrupt and criminal tendencies. Based on numerous accounts he has obvious conflicts of interest and even liberal publications like the USA Today have called for Mueller to step down as special prosecutor because of his conflicts of interest with the investigation he is carrying on. Now we know he took over the investigation in spite of his criminal activities in covering up the FBI investigation into Uranium One. A person of integrity would easily have seen his conflicts of interest and would recuse himself.Independent UK   Donald Trump s former campaign Paul Manafort has said he has not been informed of any possible criminal charges against him, after it was reported the first indictments had been filed by the team investigating Russia s alleged meddling in the 2016 election.Reports said a grand jury working with Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, had approved the first charges to result from the ongoing probe that is looking at possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The reports, which have not specified what the charges are or who they were filed against, said a suspect could be taken into custody as soon as Monday.CNN, which broke the news, said the charges were filed on Friday and placed under a seal by a federal judge. Yet, that has not stopped a flurry of speculation as to who may be the focus of Mr Mueller s charges and the nature of them. ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - The election of climateÂ\\xa0changeÂ\\xa0skeptic Donald Trump as president is likely to end the U.S. leadership role in the international fight against global warming and may lead to the emergence of a new and unlikely champion: China. China worked closely with the administration of outgoing President Barack Obama to build momentum ahead of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The partnership of the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters helped get nearly 200 countries to support the pact at the historic meet in Franceâ\\x80\\x99s capital. By contrast, Trump has called global warming a hoax created by China to give it an economic advantage and said he plans to remove the United States from the historic climate agreement, as well as reverse many of Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s measures to combat climate change.  He has appointed noted climate change skeptic Myron Ebell to help lead transition planning for the Environmental Protection Agency, which has crafted the administrationâ\\x80\\x99s major environmental regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and efficiency standards for cars and trucks. Beijing is poised to cash in on the goodwill it could earn by taking on leadership in dealing with what for many other governments is one of the most urgent issues on their agenda. â\\x80\\x9cProactively taking action against climate change will improve Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s international image and allow it to occupy the moral high ground,â\\x80\\x9d Zou Ji, deputy director of the National Centre for Climate Change Strategy and a senior Chinese climate talks negotiator, told Reuters. Zou said that if Trump abandons efforts to implement the Paris agreement, â\\x80\\x9cChinaâ\\x80\\x99s influence and voice are likely to increase in global climate governance, which will then spill over into other areas of global governance and increase Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s global standing, power and leadership.â\\x80\\x9d Chen Zhihua, a representative of the Chinese delegation and official in the climate change division of the National Development and Reform Commission, the countryâ\\x80\\x99s economic planning agency, said Chinese and other countriesâ\\x80\\x99 efforts will not change if the United States withdraws from the agreement.  â\\x80\\x9cAction by the international community will not stop because of the new government of the United States. We still have confidence the international community will join hands and continue our efforts on climate change,â\\x80\\x9d he told reporters at the 200-nation U.N. meeting being held in Marrakesh to start fleshing out the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement seeks to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century and limit global warming to â\\x80\\x9cwell belowâ\\x80\\x9d 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Each country has put forward national plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Some have raised concerns that without involvement and financial support from the United States, emerging economies like India may feel inclined to back out. One of the key advisors to Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s team on climate change said he hoped China would take on the mantle and keep the global climate deal alive.  Beijing should â\\x80\\x9ccontinue to work in the spirit that we worked together in and before Paris,â\\x80\\x9d said Andrew Light, former senior adviser to previous U.S. Special Envoy on Climate Change Todd Stern. It is an ironic twist for the government of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s second-largest economy. For years, Beijing fought attempts by foreign governments to limit carbon emissions, claiming it should be allowed the same space to develop and pollute that industrialized nations had. But with its capital often choked by smog and its people angry about the environmental devastation that rapid development has wrought across the country, Beijing has become a proponent of efforts to halt global warming rather than a hindrance. â\\x80\\x9cChina is acting on climate for the benefit of its own people,â\\x80\\x9d said Erik Solheim, executive director of the UN Environment Programme. â\\x80\\x9cI am confident China will take a lead role.â\\x80\\x9d China has powerful domestic and global imperatives to play a high-profile role in continued global climate change talks, meant to avert more heat waves, droughts, floods and rising sea levels that could cause trillions of dollars of damage by 2100. China sees a perceived role as global climate leader as way to bolster its aspiration to become a â\\x80\\x9cclean energy superpowerâ\\x80\\x9d by leading in renewable energy technology such as wind and solar power and asserting itself as a key geopolitical power.Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0  Â\\xa0   Dealing with the pressures of continued urbanization in some of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s largest cities has already put China ahead, said Andrew Steer, the president of environmental think tank the World Resources Institute.  Beijing is innovating to build low-carbon cities, he said. Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 â\\x80\\x9cIt sees carbon as an indicator of economic inefficiency,â\\x80\\x9d Steer said.

He is the supervising attorney for the firm s three Austin offices.When Rob isn t busy chasing ambulances or using a bullying incident his daughter allegedly faced at school to gain celebrity, he s publicly telling the world he d be okay if Betsy DeVos, a mother, grandmother and US Secretary of Education was sexually assaulted. It looks the real bully has been exposed Here s Rob Ranco s vile tweet, that he quickly deleted after it started to get traction on Twitter:This is what Rob s Twitter account looks like now:Here is a link to the archived tweet and to the responses Ranco got to his disgusting comment: https://archive.fo/xNdigRob Ranco, a partner in the Texas Carlson Law Firm was apparently referring to a decision made by Betsy DeVos, that she announced earlier in the week regarding changes that would be made to  Title IX as it relates to the unfair and unlawful way sexual assault cases are currently being tried on college campuses.Betsy DeVos spoke on Thursday, September 7, at George Mason University s Virginia campus. DeVos ignited a firestorm when she announced the end of yet another case of an unlawful overreach by Barack Obama, that affected every college student by stripping them of their right to due process in sexual assault cases.DeVos explained her reasoning for reversing an unfair and impractical solution to sexual assault on campuses:  Survivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators, have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. A student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus. If he or she isn t urged to keep quiet, or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement, the case goes to a school administrator, who will act as the judge and jury. The accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered. If there is a hearing, both the survivor and the accused, may or may not be allowed legal representation. Whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties. The notion that a school must diminish due process rights to better serve the victim only creates more victims. A better way also means we shouldn t demand anyone become something they are not.Click HERE for video of Betsy DeVos making her announcement that has the Ivy League educated attorney so angry.Ranco brags about his huge settlement against the Austin Police Department in 2016, for excessive use of force against an innocent citizen. Rob offered to give up his salary before the case was even settled in an effort to get the Austin Police Department to admit guilt before the settlement. The Youtube videos showing him asking for an apology for his client have all been mysteriously scrubbed, but we have managed to locate the grandstanding video and can be seen below:Rob mentions his wife Tonia, who has her own website and Youtube channel that caters to women in his profile on Twitter.Tonia has also shut down her Twitter account, as her husband s disgusting remarks are sure to harm her business whose primary market appears to be women.Leave it to a liberal to be so filled with hate for anyone who doesn t agree with him, that he s willing to destroy his own career, and in the process, destroy his wife s career as well.Here s a video of Rob promoting himself and his excellent skills as a lawyer: ',\n",

Before Wikipedia administrators put a temporary lock on the entry early Monday morning, the top Google result for the term was a link to the Wiki article displaying Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s photo, along with the following quote defining pathological lying: \\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a stand-alone disorder as well as a symptom of other disorders such as psychopathy and antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders, but people who are pathological liars may not possess characteristics of the other disorders.

Check out the Google Trends report for â\\x80\\x98pathological lyingâ\\x80\\x99 below: \\nUnsurprisingly, most reactions were supportive of the alteration to the Wikipedia article, once again showing the publicâ\\x80\\x99s general distrust of the presidential candidate. A poll conducted by Quinnipiac University last year asked voters to say the first thing that came to mind when they thought of Hillary Clinton.

       " 'Nearly simultaneous explosions targeted a Turkish peace rally Saturday in Ankara, killing at least 95 people and wounding hundreds in Turkey\\'s deadliest attack in years â\\x80\\x94 one that threatens to inflame the nation\\'s ethnic tensions.\\n\\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility but Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said there were \"strong signs\" that the two explosions â\\x80\\x94 which struck 50 meters (yards) apart just after 10 a.m. â\\x80\\x94 were suicide bombings. He suggested that Kurdish rebels or Islamic State group militants were to blame.\\n\\nThe two explosions occurred seconds apart outside the capital\\'s main train station as hundreds of opposition supporters and Kurdish activists gathered for the peace rally organized by Turkey\\'s public workers\\' union and other groups. The protesters planned to call for increased democracy in Turkey and an end to the renewed violence between Kurdish rebels and Turkish security forces.\\n\\nThe attacks Saturday came at a tense time for Turkey, a NATO member that borders war-torn Syria, hosts more refugees than any other nation in the world and has seen renewed fighting with Kurdish rebels that has left hundreds dead in the last few months.\\n\\nMany people at the rally had been anticipating that the rebels of the Kurdistan Workers\\' Party, or PKK, would declare a temporary cease-fire â\\x80\\x94 which it did hours after the bombing â\\x80\\x94 to ensure that Turkey\\'s Nov. 1 election would be held in a safe environment.\\n\\nTelevision footage from Turkey\\'s Dogan news agency showed a line of protesters Saturday near Ankara\\'s train station, chanting and performing a traditional dance with their hands locked when a large explosion went off behind them. An Associated Press photographer saw several bodies covered with bloodied flags and banners that demonstrators had brought for the rally.\\n\\n\"There was a massacre in the middle of Ankara,\" said Lami Ozgen, head of the Confederation of Public Sector Trade Unions, or KESK.\\n\\nThe state-run Anadolu Agency said the attacks were carried out with TNT explosives fortified with metal ball-bearings.\\n\\nTurkey\\'s government late Saturday raised the death toll in the twin bomb blasts to 95 people killed, 248 wounded. It said 48 of the wounded were in serious condition â\\x80\\x94 and a doctor\\'s group said many of them had burns.\\n\\n\"This massacre targeting a pro-Kurdish but mostly Turkish crowd could flame ethnic tensions in Turkey,\" said Soner Cagaptay, an analyst at the Washington Institute.\\n\\nCagaptay said the attack could be the work of groups \"hoping to induce the PKK, or its more radical youth elements, to continue fighting Turkey,\" adding that the Islamic State group would benefit most from the full-blown Turkey-PKK conflict.\\n\\n\"(That) development could make ISIS a secondary concern in the eyes of many Turks to the PKK,\" Cagaptay said in emailed comments, using another acronym for IS militants.\\n\\nSmall anti-government protests broke out at the scene of the explosions and outside Ankara hospitals as Interior Minister Selami Altinok visited the wounded. Some demonstrators chanted \"Murderer Erdogan!\" â\\x80\\x94 referring to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom many accuse of increasing tensions with Kurds to profit at the ballot box in November. Erdogan denies the accusations.\\n\\nLater Saturday, thousands gathered near Istanbul\\'s main square denouncing the attacks and also holding the government responsible.\\n\\nThe Turkish government imposed a temporary news blackout covering images that showed the moment of the blasts, gruesome or bloody pictures or \"images that create a feeling of panic.\" A spokesman warned media organizations they could face a \"full blackout\" if they did not comply.\\n\\nMany people reported being unable to access Twitter and other social media websites for several hours after the blasts. It was not clear if authorities had blocked access to the websites, but Turkey often does impose blackouts following attacks.\\n\\nAt a news conference, Davutoglu declared a three-day official mourning period for the blast victims and said Turkey had been warned about groups aiming to destabilize the country.\\n\\n\"For some time, we have been receiving intelligence information based from some (Kurdish rebel) and Daesh statements that certain suicide attackers would be sent to Turkey... and that through these attackers chaos would be created in Turkey,\" Davutoglu told reporters, using the IS group\\'s Arabic acronym.\\n\\n\"The (Kurdish rebels) or Daesh could emerge (as culprits) of today\\'s terror event,\" Davutoglu said, promising that those behind the attacks would be caught and punished.\\n\\nDavutoglu said authorities had detained at least two suspected would-be suicide bombers in the past three days in Ankara and Istanbul.\\n\\nAuthorities had been on alert after Turkey agreed to take a more active role in the U.S.-led battle against the Islamic State group. Turkey opened up its bases to U.S. aircraft to launch air raids on the extremist group in Syria and carried out a limited number of strikes on the group itself. Russia has also entered the fray on behalf of the Syrian government recently, bombing sites in Syria and reportedly violating Turkish airspace a few times in the past week.\\n\\nOn a separate front, the fighting between Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels flared anew in July, killing at least 150 police and soldiers and hundreds of PKK rebels since then. Turkish jets have also carried out numerous deadly airstrikes on Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq.\\n\\nErdogan condemned Saturday\\'s attacks, which he said targeted the country\\'s unity, called for solidarity and canceled a planned visit Monday to Turkmenistan.\\n\\n\"The greatest and most meaningful response to this attack is the solidarity and determination we will show against it,\" Erdogan said.\\n\\nCritics have accused Erdogan of re-igniting the fighting with the Kurds to seek electoral gains â\\x80\\x94 hoping that the turmoil would rally voters back to the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP. Electoral gains by the country\\'s pro-Kurdish party caused the AKP, founded by Erdogan, to lose its parliamentary majority in a June election after a decade of single-party rule.\\n\\nThe attacks Saturday, which even surpassed twin Al Qaeda-linked attacks in Istanbul in 2003 that killed some 60 people, also drew widespread condemnation from Turkey\\'s allies.\\n\\nTurkey\\'s state-run news agency said President Obama called Erdogan to extend his condolences. The Anadolu Agency, citing unnamed officials, said Obama told Erdogan the United States would continue to side with Turkey in the fight against terrorism. It quoted Obama as saying the U.S. \"shared Turkey\\'s grief.\"\\n\\nErdogan earlier said the twin bombings aimed to destroy Turkey\\'s \"peace and stability.\" Anadolu said the two leaders agreed to talk more in the coming days.\\n\\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel sent her condolences, calling the attacks \"particularly cowardly acts that were aimed directly at civil rights, democracy and peace.\"\\n\\n\"It is an attempt at intimidation and an attempt to spread fear,\" she said. \"I am convinced that the Turkish government and all of Turkish society stands together at this time with a response of unity and democracy.\"\\n\\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said \"there can be no justification for such a horrendous attack on people marching for peace... All NATO allies stand united in the fight against the scourge of terrorism.\"\\n\\nSaturday was the third attack against meetings of Kurdish activists. In July, a suicide bombing blamed on the Islamic State group killed 33 peace activists, including many Kurds, in the town of Suruc near Turkey\\'s border with Syria. Two people were killed in June in a bomb attack at the pro-Kurdish party\\'s election rally.\\n\\n\"This attack (Saturday) resembles and is a continuation of the Diyarbakir and Suruc (attacks),\" said Selahattin Demirtas, leader of the Turkey\\'s pro-Kurdish party. He held Erdogan and Davutoglu\\'s government responsible for the latest attack, saying it was \"carried out by the state against the people.\"\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the Ankara attack, the PKK declared a temporary cease-fire. A rebel statement said Saturday the group is halting hostilities to allow the Nov. 1 election to proceed safely. It said it would not launch attacks but would defend itself.\\n\\nThe government has said there would be no letup in its fight against the Kurdish rebels.\\n\\n\"Our operations (against the PKK) will continue until they lay down arms,\" Davutoglu said late Friday.',\n",
       " 'A new voice jumped into the debate over the proposed Texas â\\x80\\x9cTebowâ\\x80\\x9d bill which would allow homeschool students to participate in public school sports and other competitive extracurricular activities  â\\x80\\x94   the head of the Texas Girls Coaches Association (TGCA). He opposed the legislation over social media. [On Saturday, Sam Tipton, TGCA executive director, posted his opposition to the equal access University Interscholastic League (UIL) bills moving through the Texas Legislature  â\\x80\\x94   S. B. 640 and H. B. 1323. Tipton suggested students educated at home would not be on a level playing field with their public school peers.  As reported by Breitbart Texas, the aforementioned bills pay homage to Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow, who was homeschooled but played on the local high school football team. Lawmakers seek to grant homeschoolers access to public schools for UIL sanctioned sports and other competitive teams. Bill supporters say homeschool families pay for these programs through their taxpayer dollars but their children cannot use them because they do not attend public school. Critics fear the legislationâ\\x80\\x99s unintended consequences may mean regulation for homeschooler as dictated by the public education system. On Facebook, Tipton asserted, â\\x80\\x9cHome school students in UIL activities will determine their rules and regulations for participation while public school students will adhere to state law and local rules and school board policies. â\\x80\\x9d The Texas Girls Coaches Association is one of the largest associations of coaches, and the largest association for coaches of girlsâ\\x80\\x99 athletics in the United States, according to the groupâ\\x80\\x99s website. Although sanctioned by the UIL, the   TGCA is not part of the league. Their leadership includes coaches and administrators from all levels of public education. Breitbart Texas spoke to Tipton, who pointed to the language of the legislation. Essentially, the â\\x80\\x9cTebowâ\\x80\\x9d bills deny public schools, state agencies, or government authorities any supervision over homeschool students, their parent( s) and their curriculum. He noted, â\\x80\\x9cHomeschooled students would not have to meet the same requirements as a public school student. â\\x80\\x9d Tipton commented that under the stateâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cNo Pass No Playâ\\x80\\x9d qualifying standard, public school students must follow state curriculum and state guidelines to be eligible to participate in UIL activities. â\\x80\\x9cAll public school students are required to take all state mandated tests. Public school students in UIL athletics are restricted to eight hour after school   time along with their class period per day during the school week,â\\x80\\x9d he said, adding, â\\x80\\x9cThis does not meet the academic requirements of a public school student. â\\x80\\x9d Homeschooler sports participation would be voluntary under â\\x80\\x9cTebowâ\\x80\\x9d and these children would not have to take the public school mandated State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR). However, â\\x80\\x9copting inâ\\x80\\x9d requires testing to â\\x80\\x9cdemonstrate   proficiencyâ\\x80\\x9d via a nationally recognized,   assessment like the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, Stanford Achievement Test, California Achievement Test, or the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills. Although the National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) reported homeschoolers scored    percent higher than their public school peers on standardized tests, the national Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) opposed such legislation, stating: â\\x80\\x9cThis bill validates the erroneous idea that   standardized testing is the only legitimate way  â\\x80\\x94   or even a good way  â\\x80\\x94   to assess a studentâ\\x80\\x99s eligibility for sports. â\\x80\\x9d They recommended alternative assessments that more accurately gauge a studentâ\\x80\\x99s eligibility, underscoring that public schools require good attendance and good grades to participate in sports, but students can still score poorly on a standardized test. Conversely, the Texas Home School Coalition (THSC) the stateâ\\x80\\x99s longtime advocacy organization, highlighted that school districts have no authority over   standardized testing and homeschool parents should have the freedom to chose for their child if they want to take the tests and participate. THSC also confirmed that   and the Texas Music Educators Association (TMEA) are not affected by such a bill. THSC supports UIL equal access largely because 33 percent of rural homeschoolers experience limited sports team opportunities and find alternative programs too expensive. Homeschoolers remain divided. A Ragnar Research Partners survey found 77 percent of responding 500 Texas homeschool parents enthusiastically support UIL equal access. Previously, Breitbart Texas spoke to homeschool parents and groups like No2Tebow, who expressed concerns over eroding liberties, especially if the legislation forces UIL rules to change, also affecting those homeschoolers who do not take part in public school sports. Last week, S. B. 640, authored by Senator Van Taylor ( ) passed    in the stateâ\\x80\\x99s upper chamber. The companion House Bill 1323, from homeschool dad and Representative James Frank (  Falls) is scheduled for a public hearing Thursday. Texas introduced â\\x80\\x9cTebowâ\\x80\\x9d bills into the 2013 and 2015 legislatures, which fizzled. Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter.',\n",

       " 'For years, liberals have maintained that evangelicals have only been using religion as a means to achieve absolute power, and now one of their leaders has confirmed it.On Monday, Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention president Russell Moore wrote a column for the Washington Post blasting evangelical Christians for proving liberals right.Donald Trump, despite his more than fleeting flirtation with fascism and his campaign of hate and intolerance, has gained massive support from evangelical Christians who are willing to overlook the Republican front-runner s lack of Christian morals as long it means they get a president who will give them more power. The problem is the behavior of some evangelical leaders,  Moore wrote. I have watched as some of these who gave stem-winding speeches about  character  in office during the Clinton administration now minimize the spewing of profanities in campaign speeches, race-baiting and courting white supremacists, boasting of adulterous affairs, debauching public morality and justice through the casino and pornography industries. Moore wasn t finished though. He also slammed evangelicals, a term he is too embarrassed to use to describe himself any longer, because they are flocking to candidates who pretend to be Christians. I watched one evangelical leader pronounce a candidate a Christian, though he explicitly states that he has never repented of sin, because he displays the fruit of the Spirit in job creation. That s not a political problem; it s a gospel problem.Why are many evangelical leaders, including some who pontificate on nearly everything else, scared silent as evangelicalism is associated with everything from authoritarianism and bigotry to violations of religious freedom? How can they look the other way in silence when politicians praise Planned Parenthood and demur about white supremacists and neo-Nazis? And then he admitted that liberals have been right about evangelicals for years and they have been vindicated by evangelicals who have flocked to Trump s campaign. For years, secular progressives have said that evangelical social action in America is not about religious conviction but all about power. They have implied that the goal of the Religious Right is to cynically use the  moral  to get to the  majority,  not the other way around.This year, a group of high-profile old-guard evangelicals has proven these critics right. Indeed, evangelical Christians have only sought power and they ve had no problem rewriting or flat-out ignoring parts of the Bible that do not fit with their agenda in order to achieve it.It s been all about money and power, and evangelical leaders have fleeced their congregations so they can keep trying to topple the government and establish religious tyranny. But evangelicals have grown more and more desperate over the years as Americans continually reject them and their radical agenda that would confine women to the home and sentence gay people to death as well as declare America a Christian state governed by the Bible instead of the constitutional principles we hold dear.And Donald Trump may not be an evangelical Christian, but evangelicals are increasingly supporting his campaign because he is saying exactly what they want to hear and they see him as their last chance to take power. It s never been about the gospel or morality to evangelicals. It has always been about gaining power and using it to persecute and indoctrinate those they disagree with. And by supporting Trump, evangelicals are telling the world that they are precisely the fake Christians that liberals have been fighting against for decades.Featured image via screen capture',\n",
       " 'Oh, this is so ridiculous and so bogus that the  intimidated  researchers aren t handing over research documents and communications to the Republicans. If they want to preserve the  integrity of the scientific process  then they should be open and honest. Being secretive about results of research just shows the global warming scam is junk science they re trying to keep under wraps. The federal government s chief climate research agency is refusing to give House Republicans the detailed information they want on a controversial study on climate change. Citing confidentiality concerns and the integrity of the scientific process, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said it won t give Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) the research documents he subpoenaed. At the center of the controversy is a study that concluded there has not been a 15-year  pause  in global warming. Some NOAA scientists contributed to the report. Skeptics of climate change, including Smith, have cited the pause to insist that increased greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels, are not heating up the globe. Smith, the chairman of the House Science Committee, vehemently disagreed with the study s findings. He issued a subpoena for communications among the scientists and some data, leading to charges from Democrats that he was trying to intimidate the researchers. Late Tuesday, NOAA provided Smith with some more information about its methods and data but refused to give Smith everything he wanted. NOAA spokeswoman Ciaran Clayton said the internal communications are confidential and not related to what Smith is trying to find out.

       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - With the map of Syria s conflict decisively redrawn in President Bashar al-Assad s favor, his Russian allies want to convert military gains into a settlement that stabilizes the shattered nation and secures their interests in the region. A year after the opposition s defeat in Aleppo, government forces backed by Russia and Iran have recovered large swathes of territory as Islamic State s  caliphate  collapses.     As U.N.-backed talks in Geneva fail to make any progress, Russia is preparing to launch its own political process in 2018. President Vladimir Putin declared mission accomplished for the military on a visit to Russia s Syrian air base this week, and said conditions were ripe for a political solution. Though Washington still insists Assad must go, a senior Syrian opposition figure told Reuters the United States and other governments that have backed the rebellion had finally  surrendered to the Russian vision  on ending the war. The view in Damascus is that this will preserve Assad as president. A Syrian official in Damascus said  it is clear a track is underway, and the Russians are overseeing it .  There is a shift in the path of the crisis in Syria, a shift for the better,  the official said. But analysts struggle to see how Russian diplomacy can  bring lasting peace to Syria, encourage millions of refugees to return, or secure Western reconstruction aid. There is no sign that Assad is ready to compromise with his opponents. The war has also allowed his other big ally, Iran and its Revolutionary Guard, to expand its regional influence, which Tehran will not want to see diluted by any settlement in Syria. Having worked closely to secure Assad, Iran and Russia may now differ in ways that could complicate Russian policy.   Assad and his allies now command the single largest chunk of Syria, followed by U.S.-backed Kurdish militias who control much of northern and eastern Syria and are more concerned with shoring up their regional autonomy than fighting Damascus.      Anti-Assad rebels still cling to patches of territory: a corner of the northwest at the Turkish border, a corner of the southwest at the Israeli frontier, and the Eastern Ghouta near Damascus. Eastern Ghouta and the northwest are now in the firing line.   The Revolutionary Guards clearly feel they have won this war and the hardliners in Iran are not too keen on anything but accommodation with Assad, so on that basis it is a little hard to see that there can be any real progress,  said Rolf Holmboe, a former Danish ambassador to Syria.  Assad cannot live with a political solution that involves any real power sharing,  said Holmboe.  The solution he could potentially live with is to freeze the situation you have on the ground right now.   The war has been going Assad s way since 2015, when Russia sent its air force to help him. The scales tipped even more his way this year: Russia struck deals with Turkey, the United States and Jordan that contained in the war in the west, indirectly helping Assad s advances in the east, and Washington pulled military aid from the rebels. Though Assad seems unbeatable, Western governments still hope to effect change by linking reconstruction aid to a credible political process leading to  a genuine transition .     While paying lip service to the principle that any peace deal should be concluded under U.N. auspices, Russia aims to convene its own peace congress in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. The aim is to draw up a new constitution followed by elections.     The senior Syrian opposition figure said the United States and other states that had backed their cause - Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and Turkey - had all given way to Russia. Sochi, not Geneva, would be the focal point for talks.  This is the way it has been understood from talking to the Americans, the French, the Saudis - all the states,  the opposition figure said.  It is clear that this is the plan, and there is no state that will oppose this ... because the entire world is tired of this crisis.  Proposals include forming a new government to hold elections that would include Syrian refugees.  But  the time frame: six months, two years, three years, all depends on the extent of understanding between the Russians and Americans , the opposition figure said.  If the Russians and Americans differ greatly, the whole table could be overturned.  Russia is serious about accomplishing something with the political process, but on its own terms and turf, said senior International Crisis Group analyst Noah Bonsey.  I am not sure they have a good sense of how to accomplish that and to the extent that they seek to accomplish things politically, they may run into the divergence of interests between themselves and their allies,  he said. The Syrian Kurdish question is one area where Russia and Iran have signaled different goals. While a top Iranian official recently said the government would take areas held by the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces, Russia has struck deals with the Kurds and their U.S. sponsors.  From the start of the crisis, there s been a difference between the Russians and the Iranians and the regime,  said Fawza Youssef, a top Kurdish politician. The Russians believe the Kurds  have a cause that should be taken into account . Damascus, while issuing its own warnings to the Kurds, may continue to leave them to their own devices as it presses campaigns against the last rebel-held pockets of western Syria.  The situation in the southwest is shaped by different factors, namely Israel s determination to keep Iran-backed forces away from its frontier, which could prompt an Israeli military response.  There are still major questions and a lot of potential for escalating violence in various parts of Syria,  said Bonsey.   ',\n",

Flanked by state Reps. Martha Jane King and Jeff Greer, Stumbo discussed his thoughts on the political affiliation of Jesus and his view on what Scripture really is and how it influences politics.

       " 'PARIS  â\\x80\\x94   A French farmer who smuggled African migrants to safety, defying the authorities in an effort that his supporters likened to the Underground Railroad, was essentially given a slap on the wrist by a court on Friday. The farmer, CÃ©dric Herrou, a bearded olive grower, has become something of a hero after he shepherded migrants across the Italian border and into the Roya Valley of southern France, challenging official policy of rounding up migrants and sending them to detention centers or deporting them. A court in Nice ordered Mr. Herrou on Friday to pay a fine of 3, 000 euros, or about $3, 200. If he stays out of trouble for five years, he will not have to pay it. The light sentence  â\\x80\\x94   almost a nonsentence, given that the prosecutor,   PrÃªtre, had asked for a tougher punishment  â\\x80\\x94   was an indication of how politically delicate the case against Mr. Herrou had become. He had popular opinion largely on his side  â\\x80\\x94   a fact the judges appeared to acknowledge in essentially letting him go with a warning. At the end of a highly publicized trial last month, Mr. PrÃªtre had requested that Mr. Herrou, 37, be given a suspended   prison term. A 2012 law allows citizens to help migrants for humanitarian reasons. Before that legislation, such aid could result in a sentence of up to five years and a fine of up to â\\x82¬30, 000. But Mr. PrÃªtre said that Mr. Herrouâ\\x80\\x99s actions had gone beyond the scope of the law, helping migrants enter the country illegally instead of merely offering them shelter. Last month, the readers of the newspaper   chose Mr. Herrou as â\\x80\\x9cAzurÃ©en of the Year,â\\x80\\x9d a reference to people from the CÃ´te dâ\\x80\\x99Azur. At the trial, Mr. PrÃªtre appeared contrite at times that the law had to be applied to Mr. Herrou, whose cause he praised as â\\x80\\x9cnoble. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Herrou was cleared on Friday of the more severe charges of having helped illegal migrants stay on French territory and of having illegally hosted more than 50 Eritreans in an abandoned holiday resort. Agence   reported that Mr. Herrou had welcomed the decision in an address to a small crowd of supporters in front of the courthouse. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll carry on, because itâ\\x80\\x99s necessary,â\\x80\\x9d he told the crowd, according to the news agency. Mr. Herrou told Europe 1 radio Friday morning that he is sheltering five migrant minors from Sudan and Eritrea at his home. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a deficiency of the state in France and in Italy, so I take action,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Mr. Herrou is not the only person to have appeared in court for illegally assisting migrants. Last month,   Mannoni, a researcher, was acquitted by the same court in Nice of having offered a ride to migrants. Border control has become a defining political issue in France in light of repeated terrorist attacks.',\n",
       " 'MAUNGDAW, Myanmar (Reuters) - Along the main road that stretches nearly 40 kilometers north from Maungdaw town in Myanmar s violence-riven Rakhine State, all but one of the villages that were once home to tens of thousands of people have been turned into smouldering ash. Hundreds of cows roam through deserted settlements and charred paddy fields. Hungry dogs eat small goats. The remains of local mosques, markets and schools - once bustling with Rohingya Muslims - are silent. Despite strict controls on access to northern Rakhine, Reuters independently traveled to parts of the most-affected area in early September, the first detailed look by reporters inside the region where the United Nations says Myanmar s security forces have carried out ethnic cleansing. Nearly 500 people have been killed and 480,000 Rohingya have fled since Aug. 25, when attacks on 30 police posts and a military base by Muslim militants provoked a fierce army crackdown. The government has rejected allegations of arson, rape and arbitrary killings leveled against its security forces.  We were scared that the army and the police would shoot us if they found us ... so we ran away from the village,  said Suyaid Islam, 32, from Yae Khat Chaung Gwa Son, near the area visited by Reuters north of Maungdaw. He was speaking by phone from a refugee camp in Bangladesh after leaving his village soon after the attacks. Residents of his village told Reuters it had been burned down by security forces in an earlier operation against Rohingya insurgents late last year. Those that did not flee have been surviving since in makeshift shacks, eating food distributed by aid agencies. Satellite photos showed that tens of thousands of homes in northern Rakhine have been destroyed in 214 villages, New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said. The U.N. detected 20 sq km (8 sq miles) of destroyed structures. The government said more than 6,800 houses have been set on fire. It blames the Rohingya villagers and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which staged the Aug. 25 attacks.  The information we obtained on this side is that terrorists did the burnings,  said Zaw Htay, spokesman for national leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Reuters reporters have made two trips to northern Rakhine, visiting the townships of Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung, and driving from Maungdaw through the most affected area along the main road north to the town of Kyein Chaung. (For a graphic of the area, click: tmsnrt.rs/2y8FgQ8) The reporters talked briefly to residents but, because many were scared of being seen speaking to outsiders, most interviews were carried out by phone from outside the army operation area. Little aid has made it to northern Rakhine since the U.N. had to suspend operations because of the fighting and after the government suggested its food was sustaining insurgents. Convoys organized by the Red Cross have twice been stopped and searched by hostile ethnic Rakhines in the state capital Sittwe. In U Shey Kya, where last October Rohingya residents accused the Myanmar army of raping several women, a teacher who spoke to Reuters from the village by phone said only about 100 families out of 800 households have stayed behind. Those who remain are playing a cat-and-mouse game with the soldiers, who come to the village in the morning prompting the residents to hide in the forest and return at night.  We don t even have food to eat for this evening. What can we do?  said the teacher.  We are close to the forest where we have leaves we can eat and find some water to survive.  He refused to give his name because he had been warned by the authorities not to talk to reporters. The man said escaping through bush in monsoon rain with his elderly parents, six children and pregnant wife was not an option. Zaw Htay said the government has prioritized humanitarian assistance to the area.  If there are any locations where aid has not reached yet, people should let us know, we will try to reach them as soon as we can,  he said. About 30,000 non-Muslim residents of northern Rakhine have also been displaced. Before the latest exodus there were around 1.1 million Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, mostly living in Rakhine, where they are denied citizenship and are regarded as interlopers from Bangladesh by the Buddhist majority. Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh and human rights organizations say ethnic Rakhine vigilantes have aided the military in driving out the Muslim population.  Kamal Hussein, 22, from Alel Than Kyaw, south of Maungdaw town said his village was destroyed in early September, after which he fled to Bangladesh, where he spoke to Reuters. Hussein said Rakhine mobs  poured petrol on the houses. Then, they came out and the military fired a grenade launcher at a house to set it alight . Government spokesman Zaw Htay said some empty buildings in the area had been burned by ethnic Rakhines.  We told the regional government to take action on that,  he said.  The damage caused by the fires, Reuters interviews and satellite pictures show, is by far the largest in Maungdaw, where the bulk of insurgent attacks took place. Across the mostly coastal area, stretching more than 100 km (60 miles) through thick bush and monsoon-swollen streams, most villages have been burned. Maungdaw town itself, until recently ethnically mixed with Rakhine Buddhists, Muslims and some Hindus, is now segregated, with the remaining Rohingya shuttered in their homes. Some 450 houses in Rohingya parts of the town were burned down in the first week after the attacks, HRW said citing satellite photographs.  Those who stored food, sold it and raised money to flee to Bangladesh,  Mohammad Salem, 35, who used to sell cosmetics at the market, told Reuters by phone from the town. In ethnically-mixed Rathedaung township, 16 out of 21 Rohingya villages have been burned, according to residents and humanitarian workers. Of the remaining five, two villages in the south are now cut off from food and threatened by hostile Rakhine neighbors. In many places people have no access to medicines, residents said. Reuters talked to two Rakhine Buddhist officials who corroborated the scale of the damage. Tin Tun Soe, a Rakhine administrator in Chein Khar Li, where a security post had come under attack, said the army response was rapid and all the Rohingya had been driven out. Nearly 1,600 houses were burned down a day after the attacks, he said, though he blamed the fires on the insurgents.  They have so many people. If they are here, we re afraid to live,  said Tin Tun Soe.  I am very happy that now all of them are gone.  ',\n",
       " 'BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO has joined world powers  diplomatic efforts to stop North Korea s missile program but it cannot yet rely on its U.S.-built shield to defend Europe, experts and diplomats said. The United States says the shield, more than a decade in the planning, is needed to protect against so-called rogue states, a term U.S. officials have used to refer to North Korea and Iran.  But with Berlin, Paris and London potentially within striking distance of North Korea s missiles from next year, officials say the U.S.-led alliance s system needs more radars and special interceptors to destroy a rocket from Pyongyang.  The NATO shield in its current state lacks the reach and early warning radars to shoot down North Korean rockets. It s a weak link,  said Michael Elleman, a missile defense analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).  Early tracking is also difficult because North Korean missiles would be flying over Russia, where NATO obviously cannot put radars,  he added. The sort of interceptor needed to shoot down North Korean ballistic missiles could breach a Soviet-era arms control agreement between the United States and Russia because of its greater range, arms experts say. Moscow has long objected to U.S. missile shield plans, saying their real aim is to neutralize Russia s own nuclear arsenal, rather than meet the perceived threat from  rogue states . Russia s strategic concerns would, therefore, make it hard to renegotiate the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, something arms experts say would be required if a North Korean missile shield were to be fully effective.  Alliance planning to confront any threat from Pyongyang is in its infancy. Following North Korea s country s sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3, two senior NATO diplomats told Reuters that protection against the North Korean threat was only beginning to be considered at NATO headquarters in Brussels. That was despite a more forceful diplomatic tone on the crisis and warnings on the scale and immediacy of the threat from U.S. President Donald Trump s new ambassador to NATO, France s defense minister and the alliance s deputy head. While analysts do not expect North Korea to have a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile until next year at the earliest, NATO s European allies could become a target as a way of threatening their closest partner, the United States, a third NATO diplomat said, stressing that was only speculation. The United States switched on its $800 million European missile defense umbrella in May last year at a site in Romania to protect against Iranian rockets.  The system, controlled from a NATO base in Germany, includes radars and interceptors stretching from eastern Europe to the Mediterranean.  A final site in Poland should be ready by late 2018, extending the European umbrella from Greenland and the Azores.    To shoot down a ballistic missile from North Korea would require a new generation of interceptor, the Block II, which is still in development. It is capable of downing ballistic rockets earlier and at a much higher altitude. However, Elleman said that U.S. missile sites in Alaska and California, as well as in Japan and South Korea, were likely to be given priority before Europe, when they are ready in 2018.  There will be a lot of competition for the assets,  he said. ',\n",
       " 'Taki\\'s Magazine October 28, 2016 \\nThis election is going to have unprecedented political infidelity. A good 20 percent of husbands for Trump predict their wife wonâ\\x80\\x99t vote with them. This is wrong for a number of reasons but the biggie is, a family is supposed to be a cohesive unit. He canâ\\x80\\x99t have his better half canceling out his vote. Even if a husband wants to vote badlyâ\\x80\\x94say, for Hillaryâ\\x80\\x94his wife should stand by her man and make the same mistake. Nobodyâ\\x80\\x99s saying there canâ\\x80\\x99t be discussions and women shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have their own political beliefs, but the final decision comes down to the guy paying the bills and she should abide by that. This is counterintuitive because we live in a feminist fantasyland, but itâ\\x80\\x99s really the same as deciding where your family is going to live. A married couple agree where theyâ\\x80\\x99re going to go based on whatâ\\x80\\x99s best for the kids. If he gets an amazing job offer in Cleveland but sheâ\\x80\\x99s a city gal from Manhattan, she needs to accept that Ohio is best for the future of their family. Voting is the same. Youâ\\x80\\x99re deciding where the country is going to go based on whatâ\\x80\\x99s best for future generations. \\nUnfortunately, this is not happening. A map of America â\\x80\\x9cif just men votedâ\\x80\\x9d is almost completely red, whereas a map of America â\\x80\\x9cif just women votedâ\\x80\\x9d is almost completely blue. The maps donâ\\x80\\x99t differentiate between married and single, but judging by this massive split in what gender likes what candidate, we can assume the married map would be similar. Single people are a lost cause anyway. The women vote almost exclusively out of spite. They are voting for Hillary because she has a pussy, they hate Trump because he grabbed one, and they elected Obama because he makes theirs wet (they elected Trudeau because he is one). As for single men, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not convinced they even vote . There are also stay-at-home dads and situations where the woman is the breadwinner. This is awkward, but if youâ\\x80\\x99ve made her the patriarch then her husband (a.k.a. wife) needs to vote with her. For the most part, however, weâ\\x80\\x99re talking about a home where the father makes the lionâ\\x80\\x99s share of the money and the womanâ\\x80\\x99s contribution is using her magic powers to make babies. They have a symbiotic relationship where theyâ\\x80\\x99re both utilizing their greatest strengths. Patriarchs are best at driving, so heâ\\x80\\x99s the helmsman. He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want to fight about it because he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want to rock the boat, but for her to turn starboard while heâ\\x80\\x99s going port is to split everything in half and now the whole family is drowning. Voting against your husband is a tiny divorce.

       " 'Share This An 87-year-old man was beaten nearly to death after giving a ride to a migrant. \\nA sweet 87-year-old man offered a young migrant a ride to the train station, hoping to show him a small act of kindness. However, as soon as they pulled up to his stop, the migrant thug attacked the elderly man, beating him to a bloody pulp and punching a hole in his eye after he made one simple request. \\nAn elderly Swede saw just how far tolerance and open-mindedness reaches with other cultures after giving a 27-year-old Colombian migrant a ride from GnosjÃ¶ to Gislaved. Graciously obliging the Hispanic migrant, the old man and his wife took him 20 minutes away to the local train station. Unfortunately, the pensioner made a nearly fatal mistake when they arrived at their destination. \\nAccording to Fria Tider , the 87-year-old unnamed man pulled up to the station and politely told the migrant that they had arrived at his destination. Simply informing the foreigner that it was time to exit the vehicle apparently sent him into a rage, causing him to brutally beat the driver almost to death. \\nRepeatedly punching him in the torso and head at least a dozen times, the migrant beat the old man so badly that he broke his rib and punched a hole in his right eye, damage that was so extensive that doctors worried he would go completely blind even after 3 weeks in the hospital. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe can no longer read newspapers or see on television,â\\x80\\x9d according to the court report. â\\x80\\x9cIt is unclear if he will ever see again. Before the beating, he was alert and active in the community. Now, he needs the help of four times a day.â\\x80\\x9d \\nWhen police arrested the migrant, whose identity is protected by the liberal Swedish government, he told authorities that his victim had sparked the beating by calling him â\\x80\\x9clittleâ\\x80\\x9d and a â\\x80\\x9cnegro.â\\x80\\x9d It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t long before the thug admitted that he lied about the accusations and simply beat the sweet old man because he knew heâ\\x80\\x99d get away with it. \\nThe convict laughed during his interrogation, telling police that he was amused that a man just over 5 feet tall could take down a feeble, elderly man a foot taller. â\\x80\\x9cIt is what it is,â\\x80\\x9d the migrant heckled. â\\x80\\x9cA man of 6 feet getting knocked out â\\x80\\x94 me leveling a man of 6-feet is really laughable. I cut him down like a tree,â\\x80\\x9d he added, telling police that it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter if heâ\\x80\\x99s convicted because â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll be on the loose. I will come out soon again. You canâ\\x80\\x99t lock me up for very long,â\\x80\\x9d according to Expressen . Left-leaning Swedish authorities protect the identity of the migrant thug, forcing the media to censor his face and the Colombian flag patch on his jacket. \\nSickeningly enough, the migrant thug was right. Thanks to the politically correct justice system, he received just over 2 years in prison for aggravated assault, a sentence that will likely either be appealed, overturned, or reduced with good behavior. In fact, his appeal is currently being heard by a higher court, which is considering reducing his sentence based because he was located on social media and forced to go into hiding because of his brutal crime. \\nUnfortunately, this type of racially-motivated violence is nothing new to Europe. Just over a week ago, Mad World News reported that a group of 5 white men, 3 U.S. citizens and 2 Danes, were approached by 8 to 10 Muslim migrants who asked if they were Americans. When the 3 admitted that they are, the asylum seekers attacked all 5 of them, brutally beating and threatening to kill them with a knife. \\nThe victims received no help from the Danish government and have been ignored by local authorities. Even the central investigating police headquarters refused to take the case. \\nAs the elderly Swedish man discovered, it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter if you extend tolerance and respect, many of these migrants see Westerners as inferior humans who must be forced to submit. This is exactly what a bleeding-heart liberal found out after volunteering at the Calais â\\x80\\x9cJungleâ\\x80\\x9d camp. \\nLast week, Mad World News reported that a 38-year-old female interpreter was helping a male journalist make a documentary about the plight of migrants when a group of 3 Afghan asylum seekers attacked them at knifepoint. One of the migrants raped her while the others restrained the journalist and stole his equipment. \\nThose who despise our culture, values, and laws wonâ\\x80\\x99t have a change of heart when we show them just how progressive and open-minded our society is. They know this, and itâ\\x80\\x99s the very reason they hate us. In fact, they see our kindness as an opportunity to impose their oppressive and violent values on us without fear of being opposed. After all, we wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t want to be considered racist, would we?',\n",
       " 'Donald J. Trump, tempering the tone of his   approach to immigration for a general election audience, avoided repeating his previous call for mass deportations on Monday and instead said he wants to come up with a â\\x80\\x9creally fairâ\\x80\\x9d plan to address the millions of undocumented immigrants now in the country. The softer comments from Mr. Trump, who postponed plans to give a major immigration speech this week in Colorado, follow months of vows to build a wall along the Southern United States border with Mexico and deport immigrants who have entered the country illegally. Those proposals were a centerpiece of the platform that helped propel Mr. Trump to winning the Republican presidential nomination, and a shift would be significant. Asked on Fox News if he was   on his immigration ideas, Mr. Trump insisted that he still intends to be â\\x80\\x9cstrongâ\\x80\\x9d while emphasizing the importance of fairness when it comes to immigrants who came to the United States illegally. â\\x80\\x9cWe want to come up with a really fair, but firm, answer,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump said. â\\x80\\x9cIt has to be firm. But we want to come up with something fair. â\\x80\\x9d Although he held back on offering specifics, Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s different tone could be an attempt to court moderate Republican voters disturbed by the candidateâ\\x80\\x99s tough stances on immigration. His remarks come as recent polls have shown him falling behind Hillary Clinton in several swing states and struggling to appeal to minorities. The campaign has sent conflicting signals about whether Mr. Trump would actually change his proposals regarding immigration. He was expected to give a major immigration speech in Arizona, but it was moved to Colorado and planned for this Thursday. On Monday, the campaign canceled the speech without explanation and declined to discuss his latest thinking on immigration. Speaking on Monday evening at a rally in Akron, Ohio, Mr. Trump did not mention any changes in his immigration policy, but promised another of his key proposals, to build a wall on the border with Mexico. â\\x80\\x9cThat wall will go up so fast your head will spin,â\\x80\\x9d he said as the crowd cheered. â\\x80\\x9cAnd theyâ\\x80\\x99ll say: â\\x80\\x98You know what? He meant it.â\\x80\\x99 And you know what else I mean? Mexico is going to pay for it. â\\x80\\x9d In an evening interview with Fox Newsâ\\x80\\x99s Bill Oâ\\x80\\x99Reilly, Mr. Trump insisted he was not backing down on deportations, but would be focusing on criminals. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re going to obey the existing laws,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThe first thing weâ\\x80\\x99re going to do, if and when I win, is weâ\\x80\\x99re going to get rid of all of the bad ones. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve got gang members, we have killers, we have a lot of bad people that have to get out of this country. â\\x80\\x9d But there have been signs that Mr. Trump is preparing to publicly evolve on his immigration plans. Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, signaled on Sunday that he has been reconsidering his approach to deportations. Pressed in an interview on CNN as to whether a deportation force was still on the table as a law enforcement measure, Ms. Conway said it was â\\x80\\x9cto be determined. â\\x80\\x9d Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a staunch ally of Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s who advises him on immigration policy, also acknowledged the new uncertainty, saying on CBS that Mr. Trump was â\\x80\\x9cwrestlingâ\\x80\\x9d with what to do about deportations. Speculation that Mr. Trump was wavering also grew over the weekend after he met on Saturday with his newly formed Hispanic advisory council. Univision and BuzzFeed reported that he expressed interest in finding a â\\x80\\x9chumaneâ\\x80\\x9d way to deal with undocumented immigrants that sounded at odds with his previous plan to forcibly remove them from the country. The Trump campaign denied that he was wavering. Any reversal on immigration by Mr. Trump would represent a political feat, considering he has said repeatedly that â\\x80\\x9cwe donâ\\x80\\x99t have a countryâ\\x80\\x9d if border laws are not enforced. During the primary campaign, Mr. Trump assailed all of his Republican rivals for being too weak on immigration. He kicked off his campaign saying that Mexico was sending criminals and rapists into the country, vowed that Mexico would pay for his planned border wall and called for the â\\x80\\x9cmandatory return of all criminal aliens. â\\x80\\x9d In interviews about his immigration plans, Mr. Trump offered himself little leeway. Questioned a year ago about breaking up families, Mr. Trump said that â\\x80\\x9cthey have to go. â\\x80\\x9d Last November, he was explicit in his desire to deport and pointed to President Dwight D. Eisenhowerâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cOperation Wetbackâ\\x80\\x9d as an example of successfully removing people en masse. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re going to have a deportation force, and youâ\\x80\\x99re going to do it humanely,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump told MSNBC at the time. â\\x80\\x9cLook, we have to do what we have to do, and Ike did it and other people have done it. â\\x80\\x9d Immigration experts and independent analysts have warned that mass deportations would be costly and chaotic, but until recently, Mr. Trump has remained steadfast. A move to tone things down at this stage of the race could anger Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s base of supporters. Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa and one of the most conservative voices on immigration in the Republican caucus, said that he was not concerned that Mr. Trump is changing his position, given the ambiguity of his comments and the close counsel he keeps from the likes of Mr. Sessions. But he conceded that he would be troubled if Mr. Trump did change his sentiment on mass deportations, or if he were to advocate a â\\x80\\x9ctouchbackâ\\x80\\x9d system in which people would return to their home country and then apply for visas to return to the United States under an expedited process. â\\x80\\x9cThat would concern me,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. King said, saying that it would essentially convert the immigration system into a large enterprise by which people were being   for entry. Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said that Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s softer language is less about a turnaround that could draw in Hispanic voters than it is an effort to woo swing voters who are turned off by the candidateâ\\x80\\x99s language and proposals. â\\x80\\x9cNo rational person would believe that heâ\\x80\\x99s actually going to do significantly better among nonwhite voters after the last 15 months,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Ayres said. â\\x80\\x9cThere may be a calculation that reaching out verbally makes him more acceptable to moderate Republicans and some women, perhaps. But actions speak a lot louder than words, and he has 15 months of action to overcome. â\\x80\\x9d Since reshuffling his campaign leadership last week, Mr. Trump has demonstrated a new affinity for flexibility. He has already expressed â\\x80\\x9cregretâ\\x80\\x9d for remarks that he has made during the campaign that might have been hurtful, and he expanded his outreach to black voters. However, leading Hispanic groups said that it was too late for Mr. Trump to win their trust on immigration reform. â\\x80\\x9cThe fact of the matter is he canâ\\x80\\x99t unring the bell,â\\x80\\x9d said Javier Palomarez, the president of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. â\\x80\\x9cThese are the acts of a desperate candidate who knows he is going to lose. â\\x80\\x9d The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, has no plans of letting Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s immigration contortions go unnoticed. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the Democratic   nominee, seized on Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s latest remarks at a union convention on Monday in Las Vegas. He said that they were more evidence that Mr. Trump could not be trusted on the issue. â\\x80\\x9cWe canâ\\x80\\x99t afford to be tricked by Trump,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kaine said. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s saying that heâ\\x80\\x99ll try to deport people in a humane way  â\\x80\\x94   whatever that means. Itâ\\x80\\x99s just wrong. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

And now we have an inside look at the Trump campaign which would seem to indicate that the entire campaign apparatus is on the verge of collapsing on itself. \\nNew York magazine has just published an article by Gabriel Sherman in which one Trump staffer commented: â\\x80\\x9cThink of the bunker right before Hitler killed himself. Donaldâ\\x80\\x99s in denial. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re all in denial.â\\x80\\x9d \\nOverall, the mood of the staff working out of Trump Tower goes from gloom, denial, rage, and glee on Friday when the FBI reported it would review new materials in the investigation of Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s use of a private email server while she was still Secretary of State. \\nWhile the Trump camp should be able to make hay of the announcement from FBI Director James Comey, one problem remains: The candidate is so undisciplined that any progress made is quickly undone by Trump himself. As a top donor told Sherman : â\\x80\\x9cTrump has the following personality: NIH-NFW, meaning â\\x80\\x98If itâ\\x80\\x99s not invented here, not invented behind these eyes, then itâ\\x80\\x99s no fucking way.'â\\x80\\x9d \\nShermanâ\\x80\\x99s report echoes another article from the New York Times in which an advisor to the GOP nominee commented: â\\x80\\x9cIn Trumpworld as Hitlerâ\\x80\\x99s Bunker terms (itâ\\x80\\x99s) like when Goebbels thought FDRâ\\x80\\x99s death would save the Nazi regime.â\\x80\\x9d \\nAnd plans for what comes after the electionâ\\x80\\x93rumors of a new Trump TV networkâ\\x80\\x93also seem unlikely some inside the inner circle reveal. One prominent member of the GOP told Sherman: â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s too expensive. Trump wonâ\\x80\\x99t put his own money in.â\\x80\\x9d \\nDisgraced former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes has parted ways with Trump, reportedly because the candidate refused to stay on message and follow direction from campaign staff. Others are also positioning themselves for what happens after the election is over with. One former Mitt Romney staffer says the lifeboats are out early: â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a window into a campaign in a downward spiral when the positioning begins, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never seen it begin this early.â\\x80\\x9d \\nSo was the entire Trump campaign nothing more than ego fulfillment and an attempt to gain endless media attention for the Donald? With nine days left, that explanation seems to be the most likely reason Trump embarked on this suicide mission in the first place. \\nFeatured Image Via Gage Skidmore for Flickr available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic License About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.

       " 'The radical Baltimore mayor who ordered the Baltimore Police Department to stand down is now calling for a federal investigation into the Baltimore Police Department. What about a federal investigation into her reckless actions that were clearly motivated by her desire to side with the rioters?? Are we living in some alternate universe where all ability to reason and to use common sense has been removed from our society?Baltimore s streets will likely take years   if not decades   to recover after April s riots that left scores of business owners devastated and local police disheartened. Many cops feel  demoralized, hung out to dry and abandoned,  Fox News  Leland Vittert reported on  Hannity  Monday. There s a sentiment here of  why bother showing up?  Vittert added. Vittert was on the scene at what used to be  ground zero  for the rioting and said he had not seen a single police car during the time he was there. The area is known for drug dealings and gang activity, according to Vittert. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said more than 200 businesses were destroyed in the riots, Fox reported.  So this was your life savings you put into this?  Vittert asked a business owner whose property was destroyed. Exactly, exactly,  the business owner said. He added that his life s work was demolished in 30 minutes by looters and vandals resulting in more than $30,000 worth of damage. Vitter talked to a pharmacy owner who said 99 percent of his store s shelves were ransacked and fears the prescription drugs are now out on the streets.  There were dozens of businesses that were looted, and what was stunning to the business owners themselves is as the looting was going on, they were calling 911,  Vittert said. And, as we have reported, the police did nothing because they had an order from the mayor to  let them loot. It s only property.  Business owners are now faced with the difficult decision of whether to rebuild as they worry they will not be protected from future crime and violence.Via: BizPacReview',\n",

       " 'GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea and the United States clashed at a U.N. forum on Tuesday over their military intentions towards one another, with Pyongyang s envoy declaring it would  never  put its nuclear deterrent on the negotiating table. Japan, well within reach of North Korea s missiles, said the world must maintain pressure on the reclusive country to rein in its nuclear and missile programs and now was not the time for a resumption of multi-party talks. North Korea has pursued its weapons programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and ignored all calls, including from major ally China, to stop, prompting a bellicose exchange of rhetoric between the North and the United States. North Korea justifies its weapons programs, including its recent threat to fire missiles towards the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, by pointing to perceived U.S. hostility, such as military exercises with South Korea this week. U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood told a U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament in Geneva U.S. President Donald Trump s top priority was to protect the United States and its allies against the  growing threat  from North Korea and America was ready to use  the full range of capabilities  at its disposal. The  path to dialogue still remained an option  for Pyongyang and it had the choice between poverty and belligerence on the one hand and prosperity and acceptance. North Korea s envoy told the same forum the North s nuclear deterrent would never be up for negotiation, echoing Pyongyang s regular denunciation of U.S.  aggression .  The measures taken by the DPRK to strengthen its nuclear deterrence and develop inter-continental rockets is justifiable and a legitimate option for self-defense in the face of such apparent and real threats,  diplomat Ju Yong Chol told the forum, referring to  constant nuclear threats  by the United States. DPRK stands for the North s official name, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea. Regarding joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises that began on Monday, he warned:  The ongoing military adventure would certainly add gasoline to the fire, driving the current tense situation to further deterioration.  Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said pressure must be maintained until the North demonstrated it would give up its nuclear program.  It s not the time to discuss (the resumption of) six-party talks,  Kono said, referring to stalled negotiations involving both Koreas, the United States, Russia, China and Japan.  It s time to exert pressure,  he told reporters. The head of the U.S. military s Pacific Command said diplomacy was key. Admiral Harry Harris was in South Korea to observe annual joint military drills with the South Korean military, which the North called a step towards nuclear conflict masterminded by  war maniacs .  So we hope and we work for diplomatic solutions to the challenge presented by Kim Jong Un,  Harris told reporters at a U.S. air base in Osan, about an hour from Seoul, referring to the North Korean leader. He said diplomacy was  the most important starting point  in response to the North s threat, when asked what actions by North Korea might trigger a preemptive U.S. strike against it.  As far as a timeline, it would be crazy for me to share with you those tripwires in advance. If we did that, it would hardly be a military strategy,  he said. The United States and South Korea began the long-planned exercises on Monday, called the Ulchi Freedom Guardian, which the allies have said are purely defensive. The drills involve tens of thousands of troops as well as computer simulations designed to prepare for war with a nuclear-capable North Korea. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with the North because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.  Delegations from about 20 countries spoke at the four-hour U.N. session, including Britain, France, Australia and South Korea, all of which criticized North Korea.  I would like to repeat the appeal to the DPRK to listen to the fact that there is no alternative to stopping the different provocations and to return to dialogue,  South Korean ambassador Kim Inchul said.  We have never threatened the DPRK with any attacks and we have never promoted the use of force.  ',\n",
       " 'Be aware and be ready to push back on this effort by the State Department and the United Nations to spread  seed communities  (their term) all over the U.S. Pretty soon we ll be covered up in refugees who are mostly (90%) muslim. We already have millions of illegals from Central America that we cannot and should not support. We now know that small towns across America like Athens, GA and Spartanburg, SC are being targeted for a influx of muslim refugees. Because it s very secretive (for obvious reasons), you need to keep your ear to the ground and push back like Athens and Spartanburg. Below is a fantastic piece that will fill you in on what s REALLY going on:With Muslim immigrants streaming into the United States at a rate of 100,000 per year, some of the communities targeted for new arrivals are seeking information on their new neighbors, only to be frustrated by federal bureaucrats and their hired contractors.How does a city get on the U.S. State Department s list of 190 communities selected for refugee resettlement? How can cities find out who will be coming and when? What services will they use, and what will be the cost to taxpayers?And, the granddaddy of all questions: Can the communities be assured that foreign nationals with ties to ISIS, al-Shabab and other Islamic terrorist groups won t slip through the government s porous screening process posing as  refugees ?The answers to these questions are simple. Very little information is available. And there are no guarantees that some very bad apples won t arrive in your town, says a leading expert on the refugee resettlement program. One community that is trying to get information right now is Spartanburg, South Carolina.On March 16, Ann Corcoran, author of the Refugee Resettlement Watch blog, spoke at a national security summit in Columbia, South Carolina, hosted by former Defense Department analyst Frank Gaffney. A few days before that conference, on March 9, a story broke in the local Spartanburg newspaper that World Relief, one of the nine resettlement agencies that works under contract with the federal government, was planning to open an office in Spartanburg.When an agency like World Relief opens an office in a city, it means refugees will be arriving soon. There are no public hearings or announcements in local media, Corcoran said. Typically a story will appear in the local newspaper just before or after the first arrivals appear in town.Corcoran met some activists at Gaffney s conference who wanted to find out more about the plans for resettling United Nations-certified refugees in their city. It is like pulling teeth to get any information,  Corcoran said.  And these are long-term grassroots activists who know how to get information. One of the activists is Christina Jeffrey, a political science professor and former U.S. House of Representatives historian who ran against Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., in last year s Republican primary. Gowdy is now chairman of the House subcommittee on immigration and refugees. He is chair of this committee, and so they want to set up a refugee office in his home district, and we still can t get any information,  Corcoran said.Jeffrey has asked the federal government to prepare a comprehensive impact statement, detailing the impact the refugees will have on Spartanburg s public services. Schools, health facilities, housing, the job market and public welfare programs will all be affected, but so far nobody is saying to what extent.The mayor of Athens, Georgia, who asked for the same type of report last year, encountered the same blackout of information.St. Cloud, Minnesota, residents have also inquired about how many more Somali refugees will be arriving in light of recent problems with Somali student protests at a local community college. Dozens of other Somalis have either left the country to fight for al-Shabab or ISIS while others have been charged and convicted with sending material support to overseas terrorist organizations. They re trying to get information because residents have heard the rumor that there are 1,500 more Somalis getting ready to be resettled there in St. Cloud,  Corcoran said.The resettlement agencies hold lots of meetings and place lots of phone calls with  stakeholders  in the targeted communities, but these collaborative efforts almost always occur outside of the public spotlight. The term  stakeholders  does not apply to you, the taxpayer footing the bill for all of this,  Corcoran said.According to a March 8 article in the Spartanburg Herald-Journal,  a partnership of faith leaders  called Come Closer Spartanburg issued an invitation more than a year ago to World Relief to open a refugee office in Spartanburg. The March 8 article was the first public revelation of this effort even though World Relief had been working behind the scenes with  stakeholders  for a year. An initial group of 65 refugees will arrive this year, starting in April or May, from Congo, Bhutan and Syria.Jeffrey, in a March 30 op-ed in the local newspaper, shed more light on the group, Come Closer Spartanburg, and its goals: On its website, Come Closer Spartanburg describes the city of Spartanburg as  home to what has been identified as the fifth most dangerous neighborhood in the United States. We have extremely high rates of unemployment, poverty and domestic violence. Overall, we were recently listed as the fourth most  miserable  city to live in our country. It does not take long to realize that we are a city in need of transformation. Jeffrey discovered that the objective is to plant a  seed community  in Spartanburg that will eventually blossom and transform the city. The federal government is creating communities within communities often pitted against each other economically and culturally.It s the same tactic that has been used for decades in Europe. Looking at other U.S. cities with new refugee communities, it appears that contractors often keep sending refugees to the same place until there is a community within a community. Unassimilated communities have created problems in Europe, and we are beginning to have similar problems here in the United States (witness Milwaukee, Wis., and Lewiston, Maine),  Jeffrey writes.Corcoran said the word  assimilation  is no longer used by the resettlement agencies and their friends in the federal government. Rather, the new buzzword is  integration.  The goal of integration is to have a multitude of diverse cultures living side by side in  coexistence  but never assimilating.President Obama issued an executive memorandum dated Nov. 21, 2014, to all federal agencies directing them on  Creating Welcoming Communities and Fully Integrated Immigrants and Refugees. This sort of backroom dealing between the federal government, its hired resettlement contractors and local officials is not designed to provide information to the people who live and work in the targeted refugee cities, Corcoran said. They don t like this whole idea that their town is being secretly selected,  she said.  This has been going on for over a year now in Spartanburg, and the refugees are now due to start arriving in a month or so. And these people have no information until it s actually upon them. The mayor of Athens, Nancy Denson, requested a plan. The city of Spartanburg is asking for the same consideration. That s what these people in Spartanburg are asking for, and they are asking that when you have a plan that you present it publicly at a public hearing,  Corcoran said.  They don t want to have to show any of that to the public. They re saying it s only 65; well, it s only 65 for the first year. It will continue to be more every year afterward once you become a seed community. Of the more than 500 Syrian refugees brought to the U.S. so far this past year, 90 percent of them have been Muslim, Corcoran said.Read more: wnd ',\n",

       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s top court on Friday sentenced Habib Shartouni to death for the 1982 assassination of president-elect Bashir Gemayel, an event that was a turning point in Lebanon s 15-year civil war.  Shartouni, a member of the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP), admitted his part in the bombing in the 1980s and was tried in absentia after escaping from prison in 1990 following eight years in detention.  He was quoted in an interview in Lebanon s al-Akhbar newspaper on Thursday saying the timing of the trial was political and that he had lived in Syria between 1994 and 2004. He did not reveal his present location.  Gemayel was killed less than a month after he was elected president and soon after he agreed to start discussing diplomatic ties with Israel. His assassination occurred during Israel s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, one of the bloodiest episodes in the civil war.  His death in a bombing that killed 32 other people on Sept. 14, 1982, still resonates among many Lebanese and triggered the massacre of Palestinians in Beirut s Sabra and Chatila refugee camps.  Supporters of both Shartouni and Gemayel have protested outside the court during the hearings.  Gemayel was head of the Lebanese Forces Christian militia, locked in conflict with leftist, Muslim and Palestinian factions, and his candidacy was backed by Israel.  Its invasion was aimed at driving from Lebanon the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as well as the Syrian army, which had entered in 1976 as part of a peace deal.  After his assassination, Israel entered the capital Beirut and allowed Gemayel s militia, the Lebanese Forces, to access the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian refugee camps, where their  fighters killed hundreds of civilian refugees.  Gemayel s family is still one of the most important in Lebanese politics, heading the Kataeb party that was founded by his father. The Lebanese Forces militia later became a different political party headed by one of its commanders, Samir Geagea.  ',\n",

As Stanford University Professor, Paul Ehrlich , the author of The Population Bomb states , â\\x80\\x9cThe first task is population control at home. How do we go about it? Many of my colleagues feel that some sort of compulsory birth regulation would be necessary to achieve such control. One plan often mentioned involves the addition of temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food. Doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired population size.â\\x80\\x9d \\nWe can see clearly that the â\\x80\\x98eliteâ\\x80\\x99 class, intent on ridding the planet of its burdensome load, has already poisoned the water of 42 out of 50 states with lead .

Male infertility is rising due to these contaminants, and premature births along with miscarriage are more common due to others. If the water doesnâ\\x80\\x99t kill you, it will simply lobotomize you, or at least start the process.

He suggests that, â\\x80\\x9cChildbearing [should be] a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license â\\x80¦ All potential parents [should be] required to use contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.â\\x80\\x9d \\nForced and coerced sterilization at the hands of the Eugenics Board and other bodies is nothing new.

One reporter wrote , â\\x80\\x9c The women were signed up for the surgery while they were pregnant and housed at either the California Institution for Women in Corona or Valley State Prison for Women in Chowchilla, which is now a menâ\\x80\\x99s prison. \\nFormer inmates and prisoner advocates maintain that prison medical staff coerced the women, targeting those deemed likely to return to prison in the future. \\nCrystal Nguyen, a former Valley State Prison inmate who worked in the prisonâ\\x80\\x99s infirmary during 2007, said she often overheard medical staff asking inmates who had served multiple prison terms to agree to be sterilized. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was like, â\\x80\\x98Oh my God, thatâ\\x80\\x99s not right,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Nguyen, 28, said. â\\x80\\x9c Do they think theyâ\\x80\\x99re animals, and they donâ\\x80\\x99t want them to breed anymore? â\\x80\\x9d \\nToday vaccines are used in a similar manner to help cull the population against their informed consent. Eugenicist, Bill Gates tried to â\\x80\\x98 field test â\\x80\\x99 his HPV vaccine in India on indigenous young girls, but the Indian government eventually brought a stop to this. The Rockefeller family also quietly funds vaccines that alter a womanâ\\x80\\x99s hormones to make her less likely to become pregnant or to maintain a pregnancy. A book titled Disciplining Reproduction by Adele E. Clark explains what the elites were planning as early as the 1930s. â\\x80\\x9c Other lines of current immunological contraceptive research continue to seek what, during the 1930s, Max Mason of the Rockefeller Foundation called â\\x80\\x9canti-hormonesâ\\x80\\x9d: vaccines to block hormones needed for very early pregnancy and a vaccine to block the hormone needed for the surface of the egg to function properly .â\\x80\\x9d \\nBarack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s top science advisor , John P. Holdren has also said : â\\x80\\x9c A program of sterilizing women after their second or third child, despite the relatively greater difficulty of the operation than vasectomy, might be easier to implement than trying to sterilize men . The development of a long-term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility control. The capsule could be implanted at puberty and might be removable, with official permission, for a limited number of births.â\\x80\\x9d \\nA simple look at the peer-reviewed Plos One site offers over 7,500 additional scientific articles that connect vaccines to sterilization. \\nShould vaccines or forced implants be insufficient to reduce the number of â\\x80\\x98useless eatersâ\\x80\\x99 in the world, as Henry Kissinger has implied, then there is also the revealing text of Dr. John Colemann, who outlines the aims of a Committee of 300, otherwise known as the original hierarchical organization to plan a New World Order . Among their plans are genocide, war, the installation of dictators, the legalization of drug use, and the normalizing of pornography : â\\x80\\x9cTo bring about depopulation of large cities according to the trial run carried out by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. It is interesting to note that Pol Potâ\\x80\\x99s genocidal plans were drawn up in the US by one of the Club of Romeâ\\x80\\x99s research foundations, and overseen by Thomas Enders, a high-ranking State Department official. It is also interesting that the committee is currently seeking to reinstate the Pol Pot butchers in Cambodia. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80¦.To cause by means of limited wars in the advanced countries, by means of starvation and diseases in the Third World countries, the death of three billion people by the year 2050, people they call â\\x80\\x98useless eaters.â\\x80\\x99 The Committee of 300 (Illuminati) commissioned Cyrus Vance to write a paper on this subject of how to bring about such genocide. The paper was produced under the title â\\x80\\x9cGlobal 2000 Reportâ\\x80\\x9d and was accepted and approved for action by former President James Earl Carter, and Edwin Muskie, then Secretary of State, for and on behalf of the US Government.

The U.S. Congress recently appropriated more than $648 million in foreign assistance to family planning and reproductive health programs worldwide .

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Monday that if elected, she would pressure U.S. technology companies to help intelligence agencies disrupt violent plots after a gunman inspired by radical Islamist groups killed 49 people in an Orlando nightclub. In a speech in Cleveland, she articulated plans for expanded online surveillance of potential extremist attackers. She is campaigning against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of the November presidential election.  â\\x80\\x9cWe already know we need more resources for this fight. The professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out,â\\x80\\x9d Clinton said. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s why Iâ\\x80\\x99ve proposed an â\\x80\\x98intelligence surgeâ\\x80\\x99 to bolster our capabilities across the board, with appropriate safeguards here at home.â\\x80\\x9d While Clinton did not detail what her effort would entail, she said she wants technology companies to be more cooperative to government requests for help in countering online propaganda, tracking patterns in social media and intercepting communications. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s comments will likely further stoke an international debate over digital privacy, which has flared  after attacks in Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, California. Omar Mateen, the 29-year-old Orlando shooter and a U.S. citizen, was likely inspired by jihadist content online, but there is not yet evidence that he was part of any plot directed by others outside the United States, FBI Director James Comey said Monday. Facebook (FB.O), Alphabetâ\\x80\\x99s Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) have all dedicated more resources to combating online propaganda and recruiting by Islamic militants within the past year. But they do so quietly to avoid the perception that they are overly cozy with authorities. The companies rely heavily on users to flag problematic content, which is impossible to eliminate completely without creating a highly censored Internet, according to technologists.  Counterterrorism experts have also long said so-called lone wolf attackers are difficult to track and stop because they often do not communicate their plans to others. Twitter and Facebook had no immediate response to questions about Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s comments. Google declined comment. The Center for Democracy and Technology and Electronic Frontier Foundation, both digital advocacy groups, said they were waiting for more specifics from Clinton before commenting. Unlike Trump, Clinton did not call for blocking online content. She did not reiterate her previous push for a massive effort to break encryption, and she ruled out targeted surveillance of Muslim Americans as â\\x80\\x9cdangerous.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",

But itâ\\x80\\x99s also a fact that if your ammunition has been stored in poor conditions, it not only wonâ\\x80\\x99t last as long as it should, but it also could potentially become dangerous to shoot if it is corroded or deteriorated. \\nThis is why you need to store your ammo the same way you store your firearms. After all, you store your firearms in a secure and environmentally safe location, so why wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you do the same with your ammunition in which you may have invested even more money? \\nAll ammo has a definitive shelf life. Eventually, it will go bad. But if you use proper storage techniques, you can make your ammo last on the shelf for year and years. Ammunition that has been taken care of properly and stored in the right conditions should last for 12 to 15 years before you begin to notice signs of discoloration or corrosion. \\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s learn about some basic and yet effective storage tips you can use to ensure that you get the most out of your ammo: \\n1. Store in metal ammo cans. \\nRegardless of whether you like to keep your ammo in the boxes it came in or store it loosely, you will need to place it in metal ammo cans for storage purposes. Green metal ammo cans can be found at virtually any sporting goods store, in the $10-$20 dollar range, depending on the size of the can. \\nThe reason why you should store your ammo in these metal cans is not just for ease of organization, but also because the cans are airtight and waterproof. They are sealed around the edges, which means you could even dunk them underwater and they would keep the water out. \\n2. Store in a dry place. \\nHumidity and moisture in general will be the biggest contributor to corrosion and discoloration. Since corroded ammo is not safe to fire, itâ\\x80\\x99s imperative that you select a storage location where the moisture is kept to a minimum. \\nYes, storing your ammunition in the green metal ammo cans will do a lot to resist moisture, but it never hurts to be extra careful. Keep in mind that ammunition is not cheap, so you want to take extra good care of your investment. Store it in a dry place with low moisture levels, and you can sleep knowing your ammo should remain in good condition several years down the road. Post navigation',\n",
       " 'MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Turkey s swift response to Somalia s deadliest truck bombing drew praise from survivors and officials who called Ankara their  only genuine  international partner. It is an implicit challenge to Western backers that spend billions on security but have not, in the view of many Somalis; jumped to help.  Whenever there is a problem, Turkey helps us. Where are the other countries?  runs a popular cartoon circulating on Somali social media.  Within 48 hours of the huge twin explosions that hit Mogadishu on Saturday, a Turkish air ambulance had landed in the battle-scarred capital and picked up dozens of wounded Somalis to transport them to Turkey for free medical treatment. Its health minister also pitched up with surgeons who set to work at once in hospitals alongside Somali doctors and nurses. Ankara has invested heavily in Somalia over the past five years, with one eye on rich economic pickings should stability ever return and the other on burnishing President Tayyip Erdogan s image of Turkey as a global promoter of compassionate Islam.  Turkey is the best friend to Somalia and they were the first supporter to us after the blast,  said Abdiasis Ahmed, a jobless university graduate who said four friends had been airlifted out, one with a broken back. At least 300 people were killed in the blasts and more than 400 injured. Although Islamist al Shabaab militants were pushed out of Mogadishu in 2011, Saturday s attack - which al Shabaab has not claimed - shows the dangers still facing the capital. Many Somalis contrasted Ankara s response with that of the European Union, which has a naval force including combat ships equipped with emergency medical systems off Mogadishu s shore to deter piracy, but which did not take in casualties.  I ve heard a lot of complaints from Somalis saying  There s a huge Western navy on our shores - why can t those people come to help us? ,  said Rashid Abdi, a Nairobi-based Somalia analyst at International Crisis Group, a think-tank. A spokesman from the naval force said the force had diverted its nearest vessel, a Spanish ship, that delivered equipment and medical supplies once it reached the Somali coastline. He said the maritime area the force covers is  vast  but the ship arrived Mogadishu  as quickly as possible.   A tweet from the naval force earlier on Wednesday said it was providing  vital medical aid  for the victims. Senior officials also compared the speed and scale of Turkey s assistance with that of Somalia s foreign partners, including neighbors Kenya and Djibouti and the United States and the United Nations. Mogadishu mayor Thabit Mohamed tweeted on Monday that he was grateful for Turkey s  immediate response  and  relief for victims , compared with a  Thanks for standing with #Mogadishu  tweet 24 hours later aimed at the U.S. Embassy.  Turkey is always first to help us. They are our only genuine brother,  Information minister Abdirahman Omar Osman told Reuters, recalling a personal visit by Erdogan in 2011, when Somalia was in the grip of famine.  Their support is visible to everyone. They build hospitals, they build schools, and that s why they are different than others,  he said.  Others might give more money but Turkey is perceived by the people to be the ones really helping Somalia.  ',\n",

       " 'One would think Corey Lewandowski, Trump s former campaign manager, would eventually get tired of swiping at Paul Manafort, the man who replaced him. He s already stabbed Manafort in the back. However, when The New York Times published a report on Manafort s secret ledger in the Ukraine, it seems Lewandowski couldn t resist twisting that knife just a bit.Lewandowski was fired over conflicts with Manafort regarding campaign strategy, and they really didn t part on the best of terms. Earlier this year, Politico reported that these two were at each other s throats to the point where Trump created a new position for Manafort. This was after Manafort tried to bring Lewandowski down.This isn t the first time that he s gunned for Manafort. The last time involved suggesting on CNN that Manafort should be the one who gets fired, or takes the high road and resigns, over the disaster that was Melania Trump s plagiarized speech at the RNC.So the spirit of this tweet is very likely Lewandowski crowing over what may well be Manafort s downfall:Secret Ledger in Ukraine Lists Cash for Donald Trump s Campaign Chief https://t.co/7bh7iIHHaY  Corey Lewandowski (@CLewandowski_) August 15, 2016Why downfall? The implications for Manafort are bad, since there s at least $12 million that s slated for him, courtesy of then-President Viktor Yanukovych and his pro-Russian political party. This information also shows how the businesses with which Manafort worked raided Ukraine s assets and influenced what should have been free elections, among other indications of massive corruption.So Manafort s horrifically corrupt, which is probably why Trump wanted him so badly. This info isn t quite new, but these are details that weren t previously known. In other words, it s looking increasingly like Manafort did, indeed, have some kind of hand in helping Russia invade Ukraine, even if it was indirect. Adam Weinstein also tweeted the article, but says his own work shows that this is just the beginning of Manafort s doom: Speaking as someone who has a story coming this week: This is just the beginning for Manafort. It gets worse. https://t.co/5KTUsIHbX1  Adam Weinstein (@AdamWeinstein) August 15, 2016So Lewandowski must be positively gleeful over this. Not that it matters   it s not likely Trump would ever bring him back on board. Lewandowski, however, likes to go after his enemies relentlessly, if indirectly.

We DO NOT ignore pockets of poverty but I would say that we ignore the truth of what s going on in the black community and what s the real problem here. It s just like when the main stream media ignores and covers up the bad behavior of groups of black teens. We ve reported on numerous cases of this bad behavior that caused damage and physical harm to others. The latest case was ironically in Baltimore and the local press called the offenders  kids  when you can see clearly that these are teens. Downplaying and not punishing the bad behavior by these teens only makes it worse. No consequences breeds chaos President Obama said that  too often we ignore   pockets of poverty, lack of opportunity, lack of education  on Monday s  Late Show  on CBS.Obama said,  it s important that now that charges have been brought in Baltimore, that we let due process play itself out. Those officers who have been charged, they deserve, to be represented, and to let the legal system work its way through. We don t have all the facts yet, and that that s going to be presented in a court of law. I think it s also really important to remember that the overwhelming number of police officers are doing an outstanding job, we re in New York, today,   we re in New York today, where a young officer lost his life doing his job, and families of officers all across the country every day, they re wondering  is my loved one going to come home?  And so they ve got a really tough job. He continued,  what we also know, though, is that for far too long, for decades, you have a situation in which too many communities don t have a relationship of trust with the police, and if you just have a handful of police who are not doing the right thing, that makes the job tougher for all the other police officers out there. It creates an environment in the community where they feel as if, rather than being protected and served, they re the targets of arbitrary arrests or stops, and so our job has to be to rebuild trust, and we put forward a task force made up of police officers, but also young activists who have been protesting in Ferguson, or here in New York. They came up with some terrific recommendations about collecting data on what happens when there s a shooting involving police, what are we doing in terms of things like body cameras, and so there s some very practical, concrete things we can do to make the system work better.

However, the more real climate data we see, the more obvious the hoax becomes.This data couldn t come at a worse time for Al Gore, as his sequel to An Inconvenient Truth, released on July 28, got panned by critics.A.V. Club called An Inconvenient Truth  Less a movie than a glorified PowerPoint presentation .A new study from NASA confirms sea levels are falling   not rising.iceagenow.info reports: NASA satellite sea level observations for the past 24 years show that   on average   sea levels have been rising 3.4 millimeters per year. That s 0.134 inches, about the thickness of a dime and a nickel stacked together, per year. As I said, that s the average. But when you focus in on 2016 and 2017, you get a different picture.Sea levels fell in 2016, and with all of this winter s record-breaking snowfall, I wouldn t be surprised if they decline again this year.I clicked and zoomed on the above chart as NASA suggested, and obtained a close-up screen shot of sea levels from Jan 2016 to March 2017. This clearly shows the decline.Al Gore has falsely predicted that sea levels would rise by 20 feet, with some of the world s largest cities underwater.World Tribune reports: Although the UN s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) only predicts a sea level rise of 59cm (17 inches) by 2100, Al Gore in his Oscar-winning film An Inconvenient Truth went much further, talking of 20 feet, and showing computer graphics of cities such as Shanghai and San Francisco half under water, Booker noted. We all know the graphic showing central London in similar plight. As for tiny island nations such as the Maldives and Tuvalu, as Prince Charles likes to tell us and the Archbishop of Canterbury was again parroting last week, they are due to vanish. All of the talk about the sea rising  is nothing but a colossal scare story,  Booker said, citing Swedish geologist and physicist Nils-Axel Morner, formerly chairman of the INQUA International Commission on Sea Level Change, who  for 35 years has been using every known scientific method to study sea levels all over the globe. Despite fluctuations down as well as up,  the sea is not rising,  Morner says.  It hasn t risen in 50 years.  If there is any rise this century it will  not be more than 10cm (four inches), with an uncertainty of plus or minus 10cm . And quite apart from examining the hard evidence, he says, the elementary laws of physics (latent heat needed to melt ice) tell us that  the apocalypse conjured up by Al Gore and Co. could not possibly come about.

Never mind that his son has absolutely no experience in politics. His last name is  Conyers , and that s apparently enough for the 88-year old politician. But is that really all they need to know about the 27-year old son of the disgraced lawmaker and the former Detroit councilwoman, Monica Conyers, who was recently released from prison after serving 2 years of a 3-year term for bribery?  And should anyone be surprised by anything that comes out of the mouth of the 88-year old lawmaker, who, in 2010, was caught on video, as he brazenly read a Playboy magazine on a domestic flight in plain view of other passengers, and who has recently been accused by multiple women of either sexually assaulting or attempting to sexually assault them.  John Conyers III also has an interesting background.According to NBC News, on February Feb. 15, John Conyers was arrested on suspicion of domestic abuse but wasn t charged, after his girlfriend called the police. The unidentified woman said the younger Conyers accused her of cheating on him, then  body slammed her on the bed and then on the floor where he pinned her down and spit on her,  according to a district attorney s report quoted by NBC News. The woman claimed that Conyers III took her phone when she tried to call the police, he chased her into the kitchen and swung a knife at her, resulting in a cut on her arm.Conyers III asserted that the woman had been drinking and using marijuana and tried to throw him out of her home before they began pushing and shoving one another. He said she threatened him with a knife and cut herself as they struggled.NBC reported that the Los Angeles County District Attorney s Office chose not to move forward with the case, citing a  lack of independent witnesses  and investigators  conclusions that it  could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim s injury was not accidentally sustained.

       " 'LOS ANGELES  â\\x80\\x94   Gov. Jerry Brown on Friday signed legislation that would impose new restrictions on assault weapons and regulate the sale of ammunition in California, cementing the stateâ\\x80\\x99s reputation for enacting some of the most stringent gun regulations in the country. Propelled by the reaction to mass shootings in San Bernardino, in Southern California, and Orlando, Fla. the gun regulations are the latest example of how this state, where the Legislature is under Democratic control, has been able to enact a legislative agenda on issues that have deadlocked Congress. The legislation in Sacramento was passed with overwhelming Democratic support, and was largely opposed by Republicans who make up a small minority in the Senate and the Assembly. Even as he signed six measures, Mr. Brown, a moderate Democrat with a history of resistance to some measures of gun control, vetoed five others that he described as overly regulative. Among them was a bill that would have restricted gun purchases to no more than one per person in a   period. â\\x80\\x9cMy goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of   gun owners,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Brown, who himself owns guns, said in his signing message. The enactment of the legislation leaves little doubt to the standing of California, which in 1989 became the first state to ban assault weapons, as a leader in gun control at a moment when Congress has rebuffed such efforts and numerous   states are moving in the other direction. States like Texas, in the name of promoting safety, have in recent years expanded the locations where people can carry concealed weapons, including bars and college campuses. â\\x80\\x9cThis makes California the most   state in America,â\\x80\\x9d said Amy Hunter, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association. In a statement, she called the legislation a â\\x80\\x9ca draconian gun control package that turns Californiaâ\\x80\\x99s   gun owners into   citizens. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe governor and Legislature exploited a terrorist attack to push these measures through even though the stateâ\\x80\\x99s   laws did nothing to stop the attack in San Bernardino,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Amanda Wilcox, legislative advocate for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, hailed the governorâ\\x80\\x99s action as a step forward in efforts to curb gun violence. She highlighted one bill sponsored by Senator Kevin de LeÃ³n, the Senateâ\\x80\\x99s Democratic leader, requiring background checks for ammunition purchases as particularly crucial. â\\x80\\x9cIt is really   and bold, and really has the potential to save a lot of lives,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Wilcox said. â\\x80\\x9cIt can give us a handle on who has illegal guns in the state, as well as limiting access to ammunition by dangerous people who may have illegal guns. â\\x80\\x9d The new laws would prohibit the possession of   magazines  â\\x80\\x94   those holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition  â\\x80\\x94   for assault weapons. â\\x80\\x9cThese     magazines are not for target shooting or hunting,â\\x80\\x9d said Senator Loni Hancock, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. â\\x80\\x9cTheir sole purpose is to kill as many people as possible in the shortest period of time. â\\x80\\x9d A separate bill banned semiautomatic weapons with â\\x80\\x9cbullet buttons,â\\x80\\x9d which make it easy to quickly remove a magazine and replace it with another. Among the bills Mr. Brown vetoed was one that would have expanded the definition of a firearm. â\\x80\\x9cWhile I appreciate the authorâ\\x80\\x99s intent, the actual wording of the bill is unduly vague and could have   and unintended consequences,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Brown wrote in his veto message. Shannon Grove, a Republican Assembly member who spoke out against the bills during the debate, said that none of those signed would reduce gun violence or prevent mass shootings. Instead, she said, the restrictions compromised the rights of California families to protect themselves. â\\x80\\x9cI think itâ\\x80\\x99s death by 1, 000 paper cuts for our Second Amendment rights,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cNowhere in this nation do you give up your rights under any other amendments. â\\x80\\x9d The signing was not the end of gun control measures that might be enacted here in the wake of a wave of violence that has traumatized the world and the nation, including the shooting  in San Bernardino that killed 14 people at a holiday party in December. A separate set of gun control measures will appear before voters in November some of them have been passed by the Legislature, but Mr. Brown vetoed those, saying they should be left to voters to decide. That initiative is being championed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is running for governor after Mr. Brownâ\\x80\\x99s final term ends in 2018. His initiative would, among other things, make firearm theft a felony and require ammunition vendors to report lost or stolen supplies within 48 hours. â\\x80\\x9cTodayâ\\x80\\x99s steps in the right direction will grow into a giant leap forward for public safety if voters pass the Safety for All initiative to keep guns and ammo out of the wrong hands,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Newsom said. Gun death rates fell 56 percent in California from 1993 and 2010, a larger decline than in the nation as a whole, according to a study by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Gun control advocates pointed to that as evidence that such laws were effective. â\\x80\\x9cGun laws work,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Wilcox said. â\\x80\\x9cCalifornia gun sales are really high. We are not deterring   people from buying guns. Weâ\\x80\\x99re doing a better job of making sure dangerous people donâ\\x80\\x99t have guns. â\\x80\\x9d But Ms. Grove pointed to the ammunition law as an example of a measure that would hurt the interests of gun owners without doing anything to curb gun violence. â\\x80\\x9cCriminals who are not authorized to have firearms in the first place are not going to register to buy ammunition,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s absurd. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       " 'Written by Ron Paul Sunday November 13, 2016 In a disturbing indication of how difficult it would be to bring military spending in line with actual threats overseas, House Armed Services Chairman Rep. Mac Thornberry (R â\\x80\\x93 TX) told President Obama last week that his war funding request of $11.6 billion for the rest of the year was far too low. That figure for the last two months of 2016 is larger than Spainâ\\x80\\x99s budget for the entire year! And this is just a â\\x80\\x9cwar-fightingâ\\x80\\x9d supplemental, not actual â\\x80\\x9cdefenseâ\\x80\\x9d spending! More US troops are being sent to Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere and the supplemental request is a way to pay for them without falling afoul of the â\\x80\\x9csequestrationâ\\x80\\x9d limits.The question is whether this increase in US military activity and spending overseas actually keeps us safer, or whether it simply keeps the deep state and the military-industrial complex alive and well-funded.Unfortunately many Americans confuse defense spending with military spending. The two terms are used almost interchangeably. But there is a huge difference. I have always said that I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t cut anything from the defense budget. We need a robust defense of the United States and it would be foolish to believe that we have no enemies or potential enemies.The military budget is something very different from the defense budget. The military budget is the money spent each year not to defend the United States, but to enrich the military-industrial complex, benefit special interests, regime-change countries overseas, maintain a global US military empire, and provide defense to favored allies. The military budget for the United States is larger than the combined military spending budget of the next seven or so countries down the line.To get the military budget in line with our real defense needs would require a focus on our actual interests and a dramatic decrease in spending. The spending follows the policy, and the policy right now reflects the neocon and media propaganda that we must run the rest of the world or there will be total chaos. This is sometimes called â\\x80\\x9cAmerican exceptionalism,â\\x80\\x9d but it is far from a â\\x80\\x9cpro-Americanâ\\x80\\x9d approach.Do we really need to continue spending hundreds of billions of dollars manipulating elections overseas? Destabilizing governments that do not do as Washington tells them? Rewarding those who follow Washingtonâ\\x80\\x99s orders with massive aid and weapons sales? Do we need to continue the endless war in Afghanistan even as we discover that Saudi Arabia had far more to do with 9/11 than the Taliban we have been fighting for a decade and a half? Do we really need 800 US military bases in more than 70 countries overseas? Do we need to continue to serve as the military protection force for our wealthy NATO partners even though they are more than capable of defending themselves? Do we need our CIA to continue to provoke revolutions like in Ukraine or armed insurgencies like in Syria?If the answer to these questions is â\\x80\\x9cyes,â\\x80\\x9d then I am afraid we should prepare for economic collapse in very short order. Then, with our economy in ruins, we will face the wrath of those countries overseas which have been in the crosshairs of our interventionist foreign policy. If the answer is no, then we must work to convince our countrymen to reject the idea of Empire and embrace the United States as a constitutional republic that no longer goes abroad seeking monsters to slay.

       " 'BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump spoke about keeping pressure on North Korea with economic sanctions imposed through the United Nations, the White House said in a statement on Monday. The United States and South Korea and separately Russia together with China, carried out military drills in a show of force against North Korea, which has defied U.N. Security Council resolutions to conduct nuclear tests and ballistic missile tests. Trump and Xi spoke on the phone days after Trump and his aides publicly discussed potential military action against North Korea. On Friday, while delivering an address at a military base outside of Washington, Trump said he was  more confident than ever that our options in addressing this threat are both effective and overwhelming.  Trump is attending the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, while Xi is not. North Korea s nuclear threat is likely to loom large on the agenda.  The two leaders also discussed Trump s coming China visit, the Xinhua News Agency said.   Xi said China and the United States share extensive common interests and have seen sound momentum of exchanges and cooperation in various areas at present,  Xinhua said. Xi called on both sides to work closely to ensure a fruitful trip and inject new impetus into the development of Sino-U.S. relations, the report said.  The Chinese leader said he is happy to maintain communications with the U.S. leader on a regular basis over topics of mutual concern,  it said.  Trump will likely visit China in November as part of a trip that will take him to an ASEAN summit in the Philippines and an APEC summit in Vietnam. ',\n",

       " 'Like most   airplane magazines, Wings of China features anodyne articles, along with tips on cities served by Air China, the countryâ\\x80\\x99s flagship   airline. But the September issue, dedicated to tourist attractions in London and other   British towns, took a sharp detour into an international social media uproar and national embarrassment with some   words on safety. The passage, written in Chinese and English, said tourists should take precautions â\\x80\\x9cwhen entering areas mainly populated by Indians, Pakistanis and black people. â\\x80\\x9d It added, â\\x80\\x9cWe advise tourists not to go out alone at night, and females always to be accompanied by another person when traveling. â\\x80\\x9d The passage offended Twitter users like Georgina Blewett, who wrote: â\\x80\\x9cWhoever wrote that #AirChina racist guide nonsense should be embarrassed as hell. And the dummy who gave final approval. â\\x80\\x9d Several British politicians also expressed outrage one invited Air China officials to visit his multiethnic election district to see how safe it was. Haze Fan, a producer for CNBC in Beijing, brought attention to the passage by tweeting a photograph of it on Tuesday. â\\x80\\x9cA piece of advice in Air China   magazine. What does @MayorofLondon think?â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Fan wrote, referring to Sadiq Khan, the new London mayor, who is of Pakistani origin and whose Twitter posts regularly praise Londonâ\\x80\\x99s multiculturalism. Air China was quick to apologize, saying on Twitter that it did â\\x80\\x9cnot condone discrimination in any shape or formâ\\x80\\x9d and that copies of the magazine were being removed from all flights. Joyce Zhang, a spokeswoman for Air China in Beijing, said in an statement on Thursday that the article in Wings of China contained â\\x80\\x9cinappropriate expressions,â\\x80\\x9d and that in general its articles did not represent the opinions of Air China. The magazine apologized as well, blaming an â\\x80\\x9cediting errorâ\\x80\\x9d for the travel warning. â\\x80\\x9cAfter the problem was discovered, Air China immediately removed all copies of the magazine from all its flights, and demanded that Wings of China seriously draw a lesson from the incident, strengthen reviews of its contents and prevent similar problems from taking place again,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Zhang said. â\\x80\\x9cAs an airline that has flights across six continents, Air China always highly respects the culture and customs of people of every ethnicity in the world. â\\x80\\x9d The episode showed that Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s desire to be regarded as a sophisticated global player taking its rightful place on the world stage can be undercut by the provincial attitudes of some Chinese. Many Chinese make negative comments in private about people with darker skin color. In an article on CNBCâ\\x80\\x99s website, Ms. Fan pointed to a recent online video advertisement for the clothes detergent Qiaobi that showed an attractive Chinese woman throwing a   black man into a laundry machine, only for him to emerge, after being washed with the detergent, as a clean Asian man (presumably Han, the dominant Chinese ethnicity). In May, the detergent maker, Shanghai Leishang Cosmetics, expressed â\\x80\\x9cregretâ\\x80\\x9d over the ad, but also said foreign news organizations had exaggerated it. The Telegraph, the British newspaper, reported on Wednesday that two members of Parliament, Rosena   and Virendra Sharma, had objected to the travel warning and were contacting the Chinese ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming. â\\x80\\x9cI am shocked and appalled that even today, some people would see it as acceptable to write such blatantly untrue and racist statements,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Sharma, a member of the Labour party, according to The Telegraph. â\\x80\\x9cI have invited representatives of Air China to visit my constituency of Ealing Southall to see that a very multicultural area is safe, and would be of great value for those visiting London to see,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Sharma, who is of Indian heritage. â\\x80\\x9cI will await their response, and if an appropriate one is not forthcoming, I shall feel forced to question whether Air China is a fit company to operate in the U. K. â\\x80\\x9d Chinese tourists are flocking to Britain in greater numbers to buy luxury goods in the aftermath of the â\\x80\\x9cBrexitâ\\x80\\x9d vote and with the British pound slumping. And in 2015, Chinese visitors made 270, 000 trips to Britain, an increase of 46 percent over the previous year, according to Visit Britain, an official tourism agency. In May, Queen Elizabeth II told a police commander at a Buckingham Palace party that Chinese officials had been â\\x80\\x9cvery rudeâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 during President Xi Jinpingâ\\x80\\x99s state visit in October 2015.',\n",
       " 'Wed, 26 Oct 2016 19:25 UTC Â© Waterford Whispers News In a bid to clear up any confusion about their latest ruling on the cremated remains of loved ones, the Vatican confirmed it is still alright to scatter paedophile priests wherever they want, but not ashes. Yesterday the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church urged followers not to scatter the ashes of the dead after cremation and instead to store them in places approved by the Church. \"We\\'ll make all the decisions on who and what goes where, thank you very much,\" German cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Muller, the prefect of the doctrinal watchdog, told WWN, \"Scattering the remains of loved ones on unholy ground will only ruin their chances of staying in heaven. But the scattering of paedophile priests is fine, though; when we\\'re doing it,\" before adding, \"Please leave all the important decisions on the welfare of others to us. We won\\'t let any of our worshipers down\". The latest move comes just 53 years after the Vatican \\'legalised\\' cremation, mirroring the amount of time it takes for the church to act on various different subjects, including child sex abuse. \"We don\\'t make decisions lightly here, so we like to take our time,\" the Cardinal admitted, \"But when we do, we like to make sure that they are the best decisions tailored for the financial gain of our multi-billion euro a year organisation\". A two-page instruction issuing new rules on cremation also said that there were even some cases where a Christian funeral could be denied to those who request that ashes be scattered. \"There is absolutely no profit for us if someone gets cremated and spread over some field for free,\" Muller pointed out, breathing on a 24 carrot ring on his hand before polishing it on his silk gown, \"We offer an array of allotments across the world, and at a bargain price too. We\\'ll even throw in an annual mass and a few prayers graveside for any cremated relative wishing to be buried on sacred ground\". Allotments can range anywhere between â\\x82¬5,000 to â\\x82¬19,000 for a family plot, with the church charging over â\\x82¬20,000 for extra holy burial slots.',\n",
       " 'You would be   to find someone more devoted to the Cleveland Browns than Jeff Stemler. He exulted over the wins. After losses, he was so angry that he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t speak. The team was part of his identity. It started in his childhood, when the quarterback Brian Sipe led the Browns to improbable   victories. As an adult, Mr. Stemler became a   holder. He cried when the team moved to Baltimore in 1995, and he found love again when the National Football League awarded Cleveland with a new Browns franchise in 1998. But somehow, after hundreds of Sundays at the stadium or in the television glow, it all came to an end. It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t because the Browns were bad, necessarily. It was something else. Something deeper. Mr. Stemler, a    landscape supplies salesman in Columbus, Ohio, pinpoints the moment to a Sunday in October 2014, when the Browns thumped the Pittsburgh Steelers,  . As giddy fans spoke of a new era in Cleveland, Mr. Stemler felt nothing. â\\x80\\x9cIs this really what makes me happy?â\\x80\\x9d he asked himself. â\\x80\\x9cEveryone is going nuts, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m just kind of sitting there,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Stemler added. â\\x80\\x9cI remember this guy looking at me and asking: â\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99s wrong? Why arenâ\\x80\\x99t you excited? â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d The strange feeling did not go away. â\\x80\\x9cI think I have gotten to a point in my life where I need to let things go that donâ\\x80\\x99t bring me enjoyment,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI think as you get older, you realize you donâ\\x80\\x99t hang on to things that donâ\\x80\\x99t bring you joy. If itâ\\x80\\x99s not making me happy, then why do it? Donâ\\x80\\x99t just do it because you feel like you should be doing it. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I was doing  â\\x80\\x94   I was going up every Sunday for the Browns, and I was dreading it. â\\x80\\x9d Most fans develop a bond with a team as children. For reasons that may go unquestioned, they stick with it, no matter the emotional toll. In the view of the New Yorker writer and editor Roger Angell, our connection to sports is ultimately tied to caring: â\\x80\\x9cdeeply and passionately, really caring  â\\x80\\x94   which is a capacity or an emotion that has almost gone out of our lives,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote in 1975. But then there are those fans who begin to question why they care so much. Once doubt takes hold, they wonder why they spend so much time and emotion on mere games. Before they know it, they are on a path that takes them away from the majority culture for whom sports adulation is the norm. Julio Guerrero, 33, was an impressionable boy when the quarterback Brett Favre came on the scene for the Green Bay Packers in 1992. As Favre gave new life to the Packers, Mr. Guerrero, who lives in Milwaukee and manages a call center, became devoted to the team and joined the Sunday ritual that defines football fandom. â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t miss a game unless you have like a really special family function, like a wedding or a funeral,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThat is part of your Sunday. Itâ\\x80\\x99s part of the culture. Itâ\\x80\\x99s what you do. You go to work five days a week and you make sure you watch the Packers. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Guerrero embraced Favreâ\\x80\\x99s style of play. Here was an unruly kid from Mississippi who won over Green Bay fans with his gunslinger style and led the team to a Super Bowl victory. It seemed as if the fun would go on forever. But when Favre left the Packers in 2008, Mr. Guerrero sensed his devotion starting to wane. Somehow he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t relate to Favreâ\\x80\\x99s successor, Aaron Rodgers, and he realized his fandom had reached an end when he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t thrilled by the Packersâ\\x80\\x99 Super Bowl victory in 2011. He no longer spends his Sundays in front of the TV. He has become the guy at work who canâ\\x80\\x99t talk about the game on Monday morning. He has built a new life for himself that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t include football. â\\x80\\x9cI think the new set of friends I have are more into music and movies and arts, which is more of what I am into these days,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Guerrero said. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t really feel that connected anymore to people who go to the bar and watch the football game every Sunday. â\\x80\\x9d Even before he attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Robert McNees lived for its basketball team, the Tar Heels. Now an associate professor of physics at Loyola University Chicago, he can still see a freshman named Michael Jordan hitting the game winner against Georgetown in the 1982 N. C. A. A. tournament championship game. Dr. McNeesâ\\x80\\x99s affection for the team lasted well after he graduated. But as he grew older, he began to realize that much of his emotional attachment was bound to his fond memories of his college days. His moment of reckoning came in 2012. After holding a   lead with two and a half minutes to go against Duke, North Carolina ended up losing at the buzzer. Dr. McNees was inconsolable. Then he started to question himself. â\\x80\\x9cI was bummed out after that,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThen I was bummed out about the fact that I was so bummed out about it. Why? These are two groups of   to    playing a game. It should not have that much of an impact on a grown man. â\\x80\\x9d Dr. McNees, 43, decided to take a step back. He has not sworn off the Tar Heels altogether, but he no longer watches every game. And when he does, he is careful not to allow the outcome to ruin his day. Finding that kind of middle ground is not an option for most fans, including Rob Jordan, a    lawyer in Manhattan. As a child, he had posters of the baseball stars Ken Griffey Jr. and Mike Piazza on the walls of his bedroom. As Mike Schmidt cried while announcing his retirement at a 1989 news conference, Mr. Jordan wept right along with him. His fandom deepened with the rise of fantasy sports. He became well versed in even the most obscure baseball, basketball and football players, and he said he won thousands of dollars as a result of his expertise. About the time he turned 30, he decided that fantasy sports was no longer the best use of his time. And it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a big step from cutting out fantasy to leaving behind sports fandom altogether. Recently, Mr. Jordan gave up cable TV, meaning he no longer has access to ESPN. He didnâ\\x80\\x99t bother to watch an inning of the 2016 World Series  â\\x80\\x94   not even Game 7, which was viewed by 40 million  â\\x80\\x94   although it was broadcast on network television. â\\x80\\x9cI think there was a point where I consciously looked around and said, â\\x80\\x98Hey, I can keep admiring and celebrating the accomplishments of somebody else for a minimal amount of   entertainment value, or I can better allocate that time toward my own dreams and projects,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Jordan said. â\\x80\\x9cClearly, I came out on the side of the latter. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt got to a point where even seeing a grown man in his   wearing a jersey with some other name on the back struck me as immature and odd,â\\x80\\x9d he added. â\\x80\\x9cYou say, â\\x80\\x98Come on man, grow up. â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       " 'President Donald Trump has decided not to end the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that has guided trade between the US. Mexico, and Canada since 1994. But even his position now â\\x80\\x94  that the treaty needs to be renegotiatedhas caused protests from our northern neighbor. [â\\x80\\x9cIt has been a bad week for U. S.  trade relations,â\\x80\\x9d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday:  Last Monday, it became apparent that Canada intends to effectively cut off the last dairy products being exported from the United States. Today, in a different matter, the Department of Commerce determined a need to impose countervailing duties of roughly one billion dollars on Canadian softwood lumber exports to us. This is not our idea of a properly functioning Free Trade Agreement. On Thursday Rep. Claudia Tenney ( ) and a group of 70 bipartisan House members sent a letter to the president urging him to hold Canada accountable for its current trade commitments to the U. S. especially the dairy industry. â\\x80\\x9cUntil recently, Canada used a   milk pricing system. However, in April, Canada revised its milk classification system, which has led to changes in the dairy market that have disproportionately hurt our farmers,â\\x80\\x9d a press release announcing the letter said. â\\x80\\x9cUnfair trade deals have disadvantaged American workers for far too long,â\\x80\\x9d Tenney said, noting the dairy farms in upstate New York have been especially hard hit. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s time that we hold our trading partners accountable for their actions, especially in this case where the consequences equal lost jobs and closed farms. â\\x80\\x9cWhen given an even playing field, our famers can produce and sell the highest quality dairy in the world,â\\x80\\x9d Tenney said. â\\x80\\x9cI urge the administration to defend our dairy farmers and hold Canada accountable. â\\x80\\x9d Tenney also applauded President Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Executive Order signed earlier this week, directing the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture to conduct a review to identify and eliminate unnecessary regulations that have put undue burdens on farmers and rural communities. Former American Farm Bureau President Bob Stallman told Berns News Bureau that NAFTA renegotiations may have already started and that the U. S. should be â\\x80\\x9cforcefulâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cstrongâ\\x80\\x9d in any reworking of the trade deal.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress moved swiftly on Thursday to undo Obama-era rules on the environment, corruption, labor and guns, with the Senate wiping from the books a rule aimed at reducing water pollution. By a vote of 54-45, the Senate approved a resolution already passed in the House of Representatives to kill the rule aimed at keeping pollutants out of streams in areas near mountaintop removal coal-mining sites.  The resolution now goes to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it quickly. It was only the second time the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to stop newly minted regulations in their tracks, has been used successfully since it was passed in 2000. The Senate then turned to an equally controversial rule requiring mining and energy companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron to disclose taxes and other payments they make to governments at home and abroad. Democrats, who cannot filibuster the resolution, attempted to slow the process by pushing debate late into the night, with a vote scheduled for shortly after 6:30 a.m. on Friday. Republicans are using their control of Congress and the White House to attack regulations they believe hurt the economy. They cast the stream protection rule as harming industry and usurping state rights. â\\x80\\x9cThe Obama Administrationâ\\x80\\x99s stream buffer rule was an attack against coal miners and their families,â\\x80\\x9d said the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, adding it had threatened jobs in his home state of Kentucky. Environmental activists and many Democrats said it would have made drinking water safer by monitoring for pollutants such as lead. â\\x80\\x9cGiven that many of these toxins are known to cause birth defects, developmental delays, and other health and environmental impacts, this basic monitoring provision was essential,â\\x80\\x9d said Jeni Collins, associate legislative representative for environmental group Earthjustice. The coal industry hopes the repeal will lead Trump to overturn a moratorium by former President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s administration on some coal leases. Senator Joe Manchin, who represents West Virginia, historically coal country, was one of the few Democrats who supported killing the rule. He told CNN more than 400 changes had been made to the regulation as it was drafted. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s nobody in West Virginia that wants dirty water and dirty air, but you canâ\\x80\\x99t throw 400 different regulations ... on top of what we already have and expect anyone to survive,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Also on Thursday, the House on Thursday overturned Obama administration rules addressing pay discrimination at federal contractors and requiring expanded background checks for gun purchasers who receive Social Security benefits and have a history of mental illness. It plans on Friday to kill a measure addressing methane emissions on public lands. The Senate will then take all three up. The Senate is also targeting rules enacted in the final months of Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s administration for extinction. Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia, introduced on Wednesday a resolution for killing one intended to protect users of gift and prepaid cards. Under the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers can vote to undo regulations with a simple majority. Agencies cannot revisit overturned regulations. Timing in the law means any regulation enacted since May is eligible for repeal. The House already approved a resolution ending the rule that requires oil companies to publicly state taxes and payments, which is part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.  Republicans and some oil and mining companies say the rule is burdensome and costly and duplicates other long-standing regulations. Supporters of the rule see it as vital for exposing bribery and questionable financial ties U.S. companies may have with foreign governments, as well as showing shareholders how their money is spent.

       " '(Reuters) - Two men have filed a lawsuit against Tennessee and its governor saying their constitutional rights as gay individuals are violated by a new law that allows mental health counselors to refuse to treat patients on the basis of â\\x80\\x9csincerely held principles.â\\x80\\x9d The law, signed by Republican Governor Bill Haslam in April, has been criticized as discriminatory against the gay community. The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday by Bleu Copas and Caleb Laieski in the Chancery Court for Anderson County, asks the court to void the statute because it violates the Tennessee Constitution and the U.S. Constitutionâ\\x80\\x99s 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection to all citizens under the law. â\\x80\\x9cLGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) persons were the target of the statute. They are singled out for discriminatory treatment. There is no other group which could conceivably be the target of the statute,â\\x80\\x9d the lawsuit reads in part. A court employee sent Reuters a copy of the complaint on Wednesday via email. Jennifer Donnals, press secretary for Governor Haslam, said in an emailed statement: â\\x80\\x9cWe are not able to make comments on pending litigation.â\\x80\\x9d The law protects therapists and counselors from legal action when they cite their personal principles in refusing service, despite a provision in the American Counseling Associationâ\\x80\\x99s code of ethics barring members from such denials of service. In the lawsuit, Copas says he is a homosexual man and a resident of Anderson County, Tennessee, while Laieski says he is homosexual and describes himself as a national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights activist residing in Alexandria, Virginia. With gay marriage becoming a lost cause for opponents - the Supreme Court ruled in June that same-sex couples have the right to marry - a new battleground has become a quest by conservatives in some states to allow people to refuse services to gay men and women on religious grounds. tinyurl.com/hj29fs9 The Tennessee law is among a number of state statutes passed over the last year or so, prohibiting sanctions against businesses, service providers, professionals or clerics who refuse service, in some cases to same-sex couples or in other cases to individuals, based on profoundly held beliefs. Some states, such as Arkansas and Indiana, enacted fixes to the measures after large companies and rights groups assailed them as discriminatory. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives panel will debate legislation on Thursday intended to block Boeing Coâ\\x80\\x99s planned sale of dozens of commercial aircraft to Iran, which could also affect other planemakers, including Airbus if they became law. A Financial Services subcommittee will debate three measures, including one that would prohibit the U.S. Treasury from licensing the sale announced last month. Another would bar the Treasury secretary for authorizing transactions by U.S. financial institutions connected to the export of aircraft. A third measure would bar the Export-Import Bank from financing involving any entity that does business with Iran or provides financing to another entity to facilitate transactions with Iran. â\\x80\\x9cI am extremely concerned that by relaxing the rules, the Obama administration has allowed U.S. companies to be complicit in weaponizing the Iranian regime,â\\x80\\x9d Representative Bill Huizenga, chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee, said in a statement on Wednesday. If the bills became law, they would affect other firmsâ\\x80\\x99 sales to Iran because virtually all modern jets have more than 10 percent U.S. content, the threshold for requiring export licenses. A House committee aide said the full financial services committee was likely to approve the bills, but a vote had not yet been scheduled. However, the measures showed the extent of concern by Republicans, who control majorities in both the House and Senate, about the Iran deal and the potential Boeing sale. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, are expected to oppose the legislation. While most congressional Democrats backed the Iran deal announced a year ago, every Republican U.S. lawmaker opposed the pact in which the United States and international partners agreed to ease crippling economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran curtailing its nuclear program. When news of the Boeing deal emerged, several Republicans in Congress worried that it could threaten U.S. national security. Asked about those concerns last month, a Boeing executive noted last month that the Obama administration considered implementation of the nuclear pact â\\x80\\x9ccriticalâ\\x80\\x9d to national security. A â\\x80\\x9cmemorandum of agreementâ\\x80\\x9d (MOA) calls for IranAir to buy a total of 80 aircraft from Boeing and lease a further 29 with Boeingâ\\x80\\x99s support. Deliveries of the purchased jets are scheduled to start in 2017 and run through 2025. An Iranian official told Reuters some officials in Tehran are concerned about the legislation, arguing that if such measures become law they could endanger implementation of the nuclear deal by intensifying pressure on Iran President Hassan Rouhani to take a harder line in his dealings with the United States and its allies.

       " 'BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence assured the European Union in Brussels on Monday that the Trump administration will develop their cooperation in trade and security and backs the EU as a partner in its own right. A month after Donald Trump caused alarm by renewing his endorsement of Brexit and suggesting others may follow Britain out of the EU, Pence told reporters that he had come to â\\x80\\x9cthe home of the European Unionâ\\x80\\x9d with a message from the president. Speaking of a â\\x80\\x9cstrong commitment ... to continue cooperation and partnership with the European Unionâ\\x80\\x9d, Pence added: â\\x80\\x9cWhatever our differences, our two continents share the same heritage, the same values and above all, the same purpose to promote peace and prosperity through freedom, democracy and the rule of law.â\\x80\\x9d At a later meeting at NATO across town, he made clear that U.S. support for the Transatlantic defense alliance had a price, though; Trump, he said, â\\x80\\x9cexpects real progressâ\\x80\\x9d from European governments by the end of the year in increasing their spending on military budgets closer to a NATO target of 2 percent of GDP. Donald Tusk, who chairs the European Council of EU leaders, told reporters that Pence had given him affirmative answers to three questions on Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s support for: the current system of international law, NATO and â\\x80\\x9cthe idea of a united Europeâ\\x80\\x9d. â\\x80\\x9cReports of the death of the West have been greatly exaggerated,â\\x80\\x9d Tusk said, in a nod to American writer Mark Twain. EU officials said they were encouraged by what they called Penceâ\\x80\\x99s clear assurances, including on U.S. backing for holding the European Union together after Brexit, though they will watch closely to see how far Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s actions match his deputyâ\\x80\\x99s words. â\\x80\\x9cWe got everything we were looking for,â\\x80\\x9d one official said. Pence noted the building of common European institutions after World War Two and said: â\\x80\\x9cWith this union and in cooperation with the United States, history will attest that when the United States and Europe are peaceful and prosperous, we do advance the peace and prosperity of all the world.â\\x80\\x9d Echoing comments he made over the weekend in Germany, Pence also addressed worries in Europe over Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s suggestion that the NATO defense pact was â\\x80\\x9cobsoleteâ\\x80\\x9d; Washington, he said, was committed to defending the sovereignty and territory of European states and holding Russia to account for its actions in Ukraine. Pence also repeated Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s belief that â\\x80\\x9ccommon groundâ\\x80\\x9d could be established with Russia after years of confrontation. Tusk, a former Polish premier who was jailed in the 1980s for opposing Soviet control, seized on Penceâ\\x80\\x99s personal memories of a youthful visit to divided Berlin to remind the new administration of the value that Europeans attach to Cold War support from an earlier Republican president, Ronald Reagan. Europeans are concerned that Trump may prefer bilateral ties with European powers rather than working with the Union. Pence spoke of cooperation, including against Islamist violence: â\\x80\\x9cThe safety and security of your union and our people depends on that increased collaboration on the global fight against terrorism.â\\x80\\x9d EU officials said Pence, the former governor of Indiana, had seemed confident in his new role. One said he sought to assure them Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cvery Americanâ\\x80\\x9d, direct style should not be taken as hostile or reflect a push to isolate the United States. ',\n",

They pay over $2 billion in taxes Is anyone else out there sick of the American people being told illegals cost nothing?DACA Will Cost Americans And Their Government A Huge Amount of Money.On average, people with college degrees pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits. People without a degree consume more taxes than they pay to federal, state and local tax officials.In 2013, a Heritage Foundation study showed that amnesty for 11 million illegals would spike federal spending by $6,300 billion over the next five decades. That is roughly equivalent to $550,000 per illegal, or $10,000 per illegal per year, much of which will be spent when the immigrant becomes eligible for Social Security and Medicare. That cost estimate does not include the extra costs created when immigrants use their new legal powers as a citizen to bring in more low-skilled migrants.If those 3 million DACA people and their parents soon become legal residents or citizens, then Obama s DACA will cost Americans roughly $1,700 billion over the next 50 years, according to Heritage Foundation s numbers.Moreover, the DACA migrants add to the flood of illegal labor that has driven down wages for ordinary Americans, including urban youths and recent immigrants. Currently, Americans lose roughly $500 billion a year from their salaries because of the immigration tax caused by cheap labor according to the academies  report.Via: GP',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON  â\\x80\\x94   For Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who is   Donald J. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s choice for national security adviser, pushing conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton is a family affair: Both he and his son, Michael G. Flynn, have used social media to spread fake news stories linking Mrs. Clinton to underage sex rings and other serious crimes, backed by no evidence. The Twitter habits of both men are attracting renewed attention after a man fired a rifle on Sunday inside Comet Ping Pong, a Washington pizza restaurant that was the subject of false stories during the campaign tying it and the Clinton campaign to a child sex trafficking ring. Well before he joined the Trump campaign, the elder Mr. Flynn, 57, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, pushed unsubstantiated claims about Islamic lawâ\\x80\\x99s spreading in the United States and about the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. But in his emergence this year as the angry former general out to help Mr. Trump clean up Washington, Mr. Flynn added wild stories about Hillary Clinton to his stock of unproven tales. Six days before the election, for instance, Mr. Flynn posted on Twitter a fake news story that claimed the police and prosecutors in New York had found evidence linking Mrs. Clinton and much of her senior campaign staff to pedophilia, money laundering, perjury and other felonies. â\\x80\\x9cU decide,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Flynn wrote in the Twitter message on Nov. 2, though it appeared there was little doubt what he thought. The views Mr. Flynn has aired on social media, including messages that many viewed as crossing the line into Islamophobia, and his willingness to spread fake news stories had already prompted questions about his fitness to be Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s national security adviser. But the gunfire on Sunday was a violent turn in the debate about how fake news is reshaping the United States, and it cast a spotlight on those like Mr. Flynn who actively spread false stories about Mrs. Clinton. The hoax about the child sex trafficking ring began spreading shortly before the election, and the restaurant, its employees and nearby businesses soon found themselves subjected to threats and harassment because of it, despite a complete absence of evidence. Then on Sunday, Edgar M. Welch, 28, of Salisbury, N. C. went to Comet Ping Pong in northwestern Washington armed with a rifle. The police said he told them later that he had gone to the restaurant to â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x9d the sex trafficking hoax. Mr. Welchâ\\x80\\x99s violent reaction to the hoax did not appear to faze the younger Mr. Flynn: On Sunday, hours after the gunfire, he went on Twitter to say that until â\\x80\\x9cPizzagateâ\\x80\\x9d was proved false, it remained a story. Michael G. Flynn, 33, is more than just a relative of an incoming senior administration official. In recent years, he has served as the chief of staff to his father, who started a private intelligence and consulting business, the Flynn Intel Group, after being forced to retire from the military in 2014. Throughout the campaign, Michael G. Flynn served as a gatekeeper for his father, and he now appears to have a job with the Trump transition team. Email sent to an address at the Flynn Intel Group returned with an automated response that provided a new email contact for both Flynns, and each had a Trump transition email address that ended with . gov. The main difference in the sonâ\\x80\\x99s Twitter feed is that he appears to have shown even less restraint than his father when it comes to spreading conspiracy theories about Mrs. Clinton and her campaign. He used Twitter to spread othersâ\\x80\\x99 suggestions that Mrs. Clinton and President Obama were â\\x80\\x9cat the centerâ\\x80\\x9d of the conflict in Syria and profiting from it and that both would be tried for treason if Mr. Trump was elected. He shared a fake news story that claimed hackers had found video evidence that President Bill Clinton had raped a teenage girl. And in a Twitter message that he deleted after CNN found it in November, he questioned what was wrong with dating websites that were only for white people, saying black Americans have BET, a television network that caters largely to black viewers. Since Sundayâ\\x80\\x99s gunfire at Comet Ping Pong, Michael G. Flynn has also continued to retweet messages that say the news media has sought to normalize pedophilia. His father, in contrast, has kept a lower profile since the election. He has not given interviews  â\\x80\\x94   he did not respond to requests for comment on Monday  â\\x80\\x94   and he has kept his Twitter postings relatively tame, publishing patriotic messages on Veterans Day and more recently praising Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s selection of Gen. James N. Mattis, a retired Marine, as defense secretary. His role as national security adviser calls for mediating the conflicting views of cabinet secretaries and agencies, and sifting fact from speculation and rumor to help the new president decide how the United States should react to international crises. It is a role that is likely to take on outsize importance for Mr. Trump, who has no experience in defense or foreign policy issues and has a habit of making broad assertions that are not based in fact. Mr. Flynn, though, has shown similar inclinations both on Twitter and in regular life. His sometimes dubious assertions became so familiar to subordinates at the Defense Intelligence Agency that they came up with a name for the phenomenon: They called them â\\x80\\x9cFlynn facts. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

It is definitely worth noting that the photo comes on the same day that a woman who is very likely to be the first female president, Hillary Clinton, won the New York primary with over a million votes.Susan B. Anthony was born in 1820. She formed the Women s Loyal National League with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and quickly launched the largest petition drive up that point in American history, with 400,000 signatures demanding the abolition of slavery.Anthony followed that up with an organization demanding equal rights for women and blacks.Her activism in service of women s suffrage was launched after she was arrested in Rochester in 1872 for the crime of voting as a woman, and went to trial because she refused to pay the fine. That led to the creation of an amendment giving women the right to vote, which Anthony traveled around the country giving speeches pushing for.She died in 1906, unfortunately not seeing her dream realized. But in 1920, the Ninteenth Amendment became the law of the land, denying the right to deny anyone the right to vote based on their gender. It is only a few words, but they are powerful:The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.Anthony was later honored with her image on a U.S. postage stamp, and her face also appeared on $1 coins.

       " 'PHILADELPHIA  â\\x80\\x94   Sometimes an exhibition, planned years in advance, arrives at a moment that makes it seem remarkably prescient. That is true of a show opening on March 17 at the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia and later this year at the American Jewish Historical Society in New York. Organized by the two institutions, which are collaborating on an exhibition for the first time, â\\x80\\x9c1917: How One Year Changed the Worldâ\\x80\\x9d focuses on three historic events and their major impact on Jews around the world: Americaâ\\x80\\x99s entry into World War I, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the Balfour Declaration. The war and the revolution resulted in strict limits on immigration to the United States, reflecting a fear among Americans that unrest in Europe would spread to their country. The restrictions were not overtly aimed at Jews, but because the quotas from countries with high Jewish populations were tightened, fewer Jews were able to settle in the United States. The Balfour Declaration, meanwhile, expressed Britainâ\\x80\\x99s support for a Jewish home in Palestine. The exhibition will include 130 objects, including documents, photographs and war artifacts, that are likely to resonate with visitors as President Trump aggressively seeks to tighten borders and restrict immigration. Among the items is an undated cartoon from the era that portrays a man standing in front of a wall that bears the words â\\x80\\x9cImmigration Restriction. â\\x80\\x9d He is wearing a coat emblazoned with the word â\\x80\\x9cCongress,â\\x80\\x9d while a banner behind him says â\\x80\\x9cAlien Undesirables. â\\x80\\x9d It was in 1917 that Congress began taking steps to impose new immigration quotas, an effort that led to the restrictive 1924   Act. Josh Perelman, chief curator and director of exhibitions and collections at the Philadelphia museum, described the chilling effect that World War I had on immigration. â\\x80\\x9cThe war was most significant because it created an environment in which a powerful group  â\\x80\\x94   government, culture and academia  â\\x80\\x94   were wary of the tribulations of Europe and scared that the immigrants would bring these people to our shores,â\\x80\\x9d Dr. Perelman said in an interview, surrounded by some of the objects in the show. â\\x80\\x9cAfter the revolution, when the Bolsheviks came to power, and the xenophobia coalesced together and had the power to influence, that fear accelerated. â\\x80\\x9d The exhibition is also a strong reminder of the number of Jews who fought for the United States during World War I. An estimated 3. 4 million were living in the country during the war years, and 250, 000 joined the military, according to the American Jewish Committeeâ\\x80\\x99s Office of Jewish War Records. One, Sgt. William Shemin, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President Barack Obama in 2015  â\\x80\\x94   97 years after his heroism during the war. He had repeatedly left the safety of his platoonâ\\x80\\x99s trench to recover wounded soldiers. Jewish organizations had long lobbied for the medal on his behalf, contending that his feats had been wrongly overlooked. Visitors will be able to see Sergeant Sheminâ\\x80\\x99s medal, as well as his helmet and other war gear. As the United States was entering the war, there were concerns among Jews over the persecution of those still in Russia and Eastern Europe. One piece of evidence on display is a letter from the philanthropist Julius Rosenwald to Louis Marshall, chairman of the American Jewish Relief Committee, offering to give $1 million if the committee could raise $10 million to help Jews in â\\x80\\x9cbelligerent lands. â\\x80\\x9d A telegram from President Woodrow Wilson said the gift â\\x80\\x9cserves democracy. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIt is to America that these starving millions look for aid,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote. â\\x80\\x9dOut of our prosperityâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cfree institutions should spring a vast and ennobling generosity,â\\x80\\x9d he added. Not all Jewish immigrants viewed the United States as a safe haven. A handful of documents highlight the   story of Boris Reinstein, who came from Russia and made a career as a druggist in Buffalo. His 1917 application for a passport is on display, as is his 1923 renunciation of his United States citizenship. Mr. Reinstein was a true believer in the Bolshevik Revolution and the Soviet ideology and left his wife, Anna, to return to Russia, where he worked in the Library of the Marx, Lenin and Engels Institute. For Dr. Perelman and Rachel Lithgow, executive director of the American Jewish Historical Society, one gratifying coup was the loan of two draft versions of the Balfour Declaration from the financier Martin Franklin, who acquired them from Sothebyâ\\x80\\x99s in 2005 as part of the archive of Leon Simon. Mr. Simon, later Sir Simon, a   Jew who become director of Britainâ\\x80\\x99s General Post Office, shared the views of Chaim Weizmann, who was part of the Zionist Commission that worked on the draft of the declaration. Mr. Simonâ\\x80\\x99s handwriting is on the original draft, which has never before been exhibited in the United States. It was written on the stationery of the Imperial Hotel in Russell Square in London. â\\x80\\x9cThis was the text that was forwarded to Lord Balfour and was used as the basis of the Balfour Declaration,â\\x80\\x9d Dr. Perelman said. Arthur James Balfour, for whom the declaration is named, was Britainâ\\x80\\x99s foreign secretary. The final declaration, in the form of a letter dated Nov. 2, 1917, was sent to one of Britainâ\\x80\\x99s most distinguished Jewish citizens, Baron Lionel Walter Rothschild. Ultimately, it said, in part: â\\x80\\x9cHis Majestyâ\\x80\\x99s government view with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object. â\\x80\\x9d The document also added that â\\x80\\x9cnothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing   communities in Palestine. â\\x80\\x9d Explaining his purchase of the document, Mr. Franklin said: â\\x80\\x9cI bought it for two reasons: one, it is probably the most important document in the creation of the state of Israel. And second, my great   was the first high commissionerâ\\x80\\x9d: Lord Herbert Samuel, who arrived in Palestine in 1920. â\\x80\\x9dSo I thought maybe we should keep it in the family. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

And last week, Marine Le Pen, the partyâ\\x80\\x99s leader, packed thousands into a steamy meeting hall nearby for a pugnacious speech mocking â\\x80\\x9cthe systemâ\\x80\\x9d and vowing victory in this springâ\\x80\\x99s French presidential election. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s been a real evolution,â\\x80\\x9d Philippe   the retired head of a small manufacturing company, said as he handed out National Front leaflets in the market on a recent day. â\\x80\\x9cA few years ago, they would insult us.

But a visit to this southeastern National Front stronghold suggests that Ms. Le Pen may be succeeding in broadening her appeal to the point where a victory is more plausible, even if the odds are still stacked against her. With a month to go, the signs are mixed. Many voters, particularly affluent ones, at markets here and farther up the coast betray a traditional distaste for the   party. Yet others once repelled by a party with a heritage rooted in Franceâ\\x80\\x99s darkest political traditions  â\\x80\\x94     xenophobia and a penchant for the fist  â\\x80\\x94   are considering it. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve said several times I would do it, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never had the courage,â\\x80\\x9d Christian Pignol, a vendor of plants and vegetables at the Bandol market, said about voting for the National Front. â\\x80\\x9cThis time may be the good one. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the fear of the unknown,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, as several fellow vendors nodded. â\\x80\\x9cPeople would like to try it, but they are afraid. But maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s the solution. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve tried everything for 30, 40 years. Weâ\\x80\\x99d like to try it, but weâ\\x80\\x99re also afraid. â\\x80\\x9d French politics are particularly volatile this election season. Traditional power centers  â\\x80\\x94   the governing Socialists and the   Republicans  â\\x80\\x94   are in turmoil. Ms. Le Penâ\\x80\\x99s chief rival, Emmanuel Macron, is a youthful and untested politician running at the head of a new party. Those uncertainties  â\\x80\\x94   and a nagging sense that mainstream parties have failed to offer solutions to Franceâ\\x80\\x99s economic anemia  â\\x80\\x94   have left the National Front better positioned than at any time in its   history. But if it is to win nationally, the party must do much better than even the 49 percent support it won in this conservative Var department, home to three National Front mayors, in elections in 2015. More critically, it must turn   areas of the country in Ms. Le Penâ\\x80\\x99s favor and attract new kinds of voters  â\\x80\\x94   professionals and the upper and middle classes. Political analysts are skeptical. FrÃ©dÃ©ric Boccaletti, the partyâ\\x80\\x99s leader in the Var, knows exactly what needs to be done. Last week, he and his fellow National Front activists gathered for an evening planning session in La    a   port town devastated by the closing of   naval shipyards nearly 20 years ago. Mr. Boccaletti, who is running for Parliament, keeps his headquarters here. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m telling you, youâ\\x80\\x99ve got to go to the difficult neighborhoods  â\\x80\\x94   itâ\\x80\\x99s not what you think,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Boccaletti told them, laughing slyly. â\\x80\\x9cOur work has got to be in the areas that have resisted us mostâ\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x94   meaning the coastâ\\x80\\x99s more affluent areas. It is not unlike the strategy that President Trump applied in the United States by campaigning in   Democratic strongholds in   Ohio. No one thought he stood a chance there. Yet he won. â\\x80\\x9cNow, weâ\\x80\\x99ve got doctors, lawyers, the liberal professions with us,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Boccaletti said. â\\x80\\x9cSince the election of Marineâ\\x80\\x9d to the partyâ\\x80\\x99s presidency in 2011, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s all changed. â\\x80\\x9d Yes and no. Since then, to broaden the partyâ\\x80\\x99s appeal, Ms. Le Pen has worked to buff the National Frontâ\\x80\\x99s image and distance it from its founder,   Le Pen, her disavowed   father, even kicking him out of the party in 2015. That strategy has helped make the National Front potentially palatable to some voters who had hesitated before. In the early days, four decades ago, winning 10 percent of the vote was considered a triumph for the party. This year, some polls predict Ms. Le Pen will get as much as 45 percent of the vote.   of her own edge toward the mainstream, Ms. Le Pen now buries her most incendiary proclamations. At a rally in nearby   last week, she pledged to cut taxes and â\\x80\\x9cdrasticallyâ\\x80\\x9d reduce immigration  â\\x80\\x94   well inside generic political formulations. Also last week, the party dismissed an official in the region for Holocaust denial. Still, Ms. Le Pen often emits the dog whistles easily recognized by her cheering crowds, as in a recent speech at Nantes, where she denounced in quick succession â\\x80\\x9cthe Rothschild bank,â\\x80\\x9d and the   media and telecom magnate Patrick Drahi, a   businessman with French and Israeli citizenship. Ms. Le Pen and her party still show little compunction over using tried and true National Front strategies that stoke racial fears. A wall at Mr. Boccalettiâ\\x80\\x99s tiny party headquarters here is adorned with a poster showing a hand tearing down a star and crescent, a symbol of Islam, with the slogan â\\x80\\x9cHere, We Are in France. â\\x80\\x9d Another poster showed a veiled Muslim woman accompanied by the words â\\x80\\x9cNo to Islamism. â\\x80\\x9d When the beaming Ms. Le Pen clambers onstage at her rallies, menacing chords give way to triumphant brassy blasts. At the more elaborate rallies, Wagnerian electric flame throwers dramatically cap her closing vows to â\\x80\\x9crenew the ties of national solidarity. â\\x80\\x9d In   it was Ms. Le Penâ\\x80\\x99s thrusts against the â\\x80\\x9cmass immigrationâ\\x80\\x9d and its supposed link to Franceâ\\x80\\x99s mass unemployment that drew the loudest roars. â\\x80\\x9cThis is our country!â\\x80\\x9d the crowd chanted. â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s going to send home the immigrants,â\\x80\\x9d said Jean Simon, a grizzled construction worker from Nice, who attended. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s way too much unemployment. â\\x80\\x9d Lashing the two issues together is a ploy straight from a playbook that dates to the National Frontâ\\x80\\x99s original doctrine in 1972. It is part of legacy that continues to give a good many French people pause. Some 58 percent of them still consider the Front a â\\x80\\x9cdangerâ\\x80\\x9d for democracy, according to a poll published in Le Monde this month, 11 percentage points more than in 2013. Yet there is enough uncertainty over whether Ms. Pen has sufficiently softened up traditional resistance that, for the first time, the candidate of a party still considered extremist by many has become the person to beat. The mainstream media is in near hysteria. Last weekâ\\x80\\x99s cover headline in the Journal du Dimanche warned of the â\\x80\\x9cLe Pen Menace. â\\x80\\x9d The cover of this weekâ\\x80\\x99s Lâ\\x80\\x99Obs predicted in bold type: â\\x80\\x9cIf Le Pen is elected: The Black Scenario. â\\x80\\x9d In Lâ\\x80\\x99Express it was â\\x80\\x9cWhy Le Pen is advancing  â\\x80\\x94   again. â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Le Pen is in the unusual position of seeming like a winner and a loser at the same time. She is a winner because every French poll predicts she will come out on top in the first round. Four major candidates will be competing against her that day  â\\x80\\x94   two on the left, one in the center and one on the right. None, alone, can beat her. But she is a loser because those same polls all say she will be defeated by a hefty margin in the second round of voting on May 7, whoever her opponent is. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think she will be elected president,â\\x80\\x9d said JoÃ«l Gombin of the University of Picardy Jules Verne, one of Franceâ\\x80\\x99s leading experts on the Front. â\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s not impossible any longer. â\\x80\\x9cAnd even if sheâ\\x80\\x99s not elected, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a strong possibility that French political life will be turned upside down, and the National Front will play a larger role,â\\x80\\x9d he added. The ambiguous status of winner and loser gives her whole campaign  â\\x80\\x94   the tone of her voters, her activists, her top lieutenants and even Ms. Le Pen herself  â\\x80\\x94   an uncertain feel, as if all are floating a few feet above reality. Muriel Fiol, a local doctor who was helping Mr. Boccaletti run the meeting, predicted that the â\\x80\\x9cglass ceiling was going to explode. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPeople donâ\\x80\\x99t want this political class any more,â\\x80\\x9d she said. But Mr. Boccaletti urged prudence. There was still some way to go, as attitudes of many locals showed. Even if buoyed by the feeling that Ms. Le Pen is a player for the first time, volunteers conceded that the going was â\\x80\\x9cdifficult,â\\x80\\x9d as was sometimes shown by the reception at the colorful market in this fishing port of pastel houses on the Mediterranean. Certainly, not all were convinced that Ms. Le Pen had outrun the long shadow of her partyâ\\x80\\x99s ugly reputation. â\\x80\\x9cSure, I took their leaflet,â\\x80\\x9d Bernard Cornet, a retired teacher, said, broadly grinning. â\\x80\\x9cOnly so that I could throw it into the trash straight away. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " 'Leslie Moonves, the CEO of CBS, one of the three largest media outlets in the United States, was recently caught on tape gleefully celebrating the rise of Donald Trump.During an investor meeting held at the end of February, Moonves laughingly told the audience that the rise of Trump  may not be good for America, but it s damn good for CBS. Moonves says, Man, who would have expected the ride we re all having right now? This is pretty amazing. An ecstatic Moonves then goes on to ask,  Who would have thought that this circus would come to town? As he tells investors that the Trump show has been  damn good,  for company profits, the entire room explodes with laughter.Barely able to contain himself, Moonves tells the crowd that  the money s rolling in. What can I say,  he continues, still laughing,  This is fun. After saying that he s never seen anything like what s going on in American politics today, with presidential candidates  throwing bombs at each other,  and  not even talking about the issues,  Moonves rejoices over the fact that  the marketplace is flooded with money,  and then proclaims that  This is going to be a very good year for us. It s no surprise that America s trust in the mainstream media has fallen to a historic low.What is somewhat surprising is the fact that 40 percent of the Americans still think that the mainstream media is  trustworthy. Journalistic integrity and ethics in reporting went out the window with the end of the Fairness Doctrine in the 1980s. It was further eroded by media consolidation, which began in the 1990s, after the Telecommunications Act was passed.Today, six networks own 90 percent of the U.S. media.If you thought those companies were interested in something other than generating as much money as possible, you won t after you hear Moonves comments and listen to the laughter coming from those who stand to make a lot of money off the evil Donald Trump is spreading across our country.Watch the video below from Thom Hartmann on YouTube. The audio starts at roughly 4:15. The founders of our country understood that a free and independent media is essential to a healthy democracy.In the U.S., the press is no longer the watchdog of government that it once was. Instead, as this leaked audio shows us, it is simply the means through which giant corporations rake in huge profits for their shareholders, unphased by trivial things like what s best for the country or even what s ethical or moral.As the New York Times reported here on March 15, the media s coverage of candidates in the 2016 elections has been anything but equal or fair.The numbers shown on the chart below represent millions of dollars in media coverage, comparing paid advertising to free coverage each candidate has gotten from the media.Image credit: screen capture New York TimesAs you can see from the graph, the mainstream media has spent a huge amount of time on Donald Trump coverage, while also neglecting every other candidate in the race.What this leaked recording should tell us is that we need to stop tuning in to everything Trump. Since there s no doubt that the media is motivated by profit alone, the best way to address the problem (outside of legislation) is to stop tuning in to the media s non-stop coverage of Donald Trump.If we want Trump to go away, and most of us do, the best way we can make that happen is for the public to quit rewarding the media for their excessive coverage of Trump, which is coming at the expense of all the other candidates, and our democracy.Image credit: video screen capture Thom Hartmann on youtube',\n",

       " 'VIDEOS Will Barack Obama delay or suspend the election if Hillary is forced out by the new FBI email investigation? An A.I. system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of #Hillary By Michael Snyder - November 3, 2016 \\nJust when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails â\\x80\\x9cdid not come from her private serverâ\\x80\\x9d, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the â\\x80\\x9cemails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiryâ\\x80\\x9d, and according to some reports there may be â\\x80\\x9cpotentially thousandsâ\\x80\\x9d of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? \\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN â\\x80¦ After recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that â\\x80\\x9cappear to be pertinentâ\\x80\\x9d to the email probe. â\\x80\\x9cIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,â\\x80\\x9d Comey wrote the chairmen. â\\x80\\x9cI am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.â\\x80\\x9d \\nAt this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered â\\x80¦ We donâ\\x80\\x99t know what this means yet except that itâ\\x80\\x99s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So thatâ\\x80\\x99s where we areâ\\x80¦ Is it a certainty that we wonâ\\x80\\x99t learn before the election? Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure itâ\\x80\\x99s a certainty we wonâ\\x80\\x99t learn before the election. One thing is, itâ\\x80\\x99s possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from herâ\\x80¦ \\nIf the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? \\nIt is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. \\nSo those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. \\nBut if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reasonâ\\x80¦ If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this yearâ\\x80\\x99s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members â\\x80\\x93 a number that changes over time and is guided by the groupâ\\x80\\x99s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \\nIt would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. \\nIn such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be â\\x80\\x9cfairâ\\x80\\x9d until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. \\nMeanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. \\nAnd CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in Novemberâ\\x80¦ An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. \\nWithout Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. \\nSo if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. \\nAt this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday took its first step in replacing Obama-era banking regulators, naming a veteran financial lawyer as interim head of the watchdog for federally chartered banks. Keith Noreika, a partner at law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, will be first deputy comptroller at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and will run the OCC on an interim basis when Comptroller Thomas Curry leaves on May 5, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.  Former banker Joseph Otting, who worked with Mnuchin at Californian lender OneWest, is considered the lead contender to permanently replace Curry, several people familiar with the matter have said. That appointment requires Senate confirmation and analysts said they expected Noreika to be in charge for much of this year. U.S. President Donald Trump wants to overhaul regulation of the financial services system to make it easier for banks to lend and has asked Mnuchin to review the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law by June 3.  The OCC is one of several regulators that monitors the health of Wall Street banks but has a particularly influential role in scrutinizing lending practices. Under Curry, OCC bank examiners have clamped down on what they perceive as overly risky loans, particularly the type used to fund private equity buyouts. Curry used his position to warn banks when he thought they were talking on too much risk in loans to energy firms and property developers. â\\x80\\x9cCurry did use the bully pulpit to warn banks against risky activity and I think youâ\\x80\\x99re likely to see less of that going forward,â\\x80\\x9d said Ian Katz, financial policy analyst at research firm Capital Alpha.  The appointment of Noreika and the expected nomination of Otting meant limits on how much banks can lend to highly indebted companies may be loosened in the future, said Jaret Seiberg, analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group. â\\x80\\x9cThis is the most bullish sign yet for the biggest banks that the Trump administration will pursue a traditional Republican approach of financial regulation rather than adopt a more populist tone that could include high leverage capital requirements,â\\x80\\x9d Seiberg said. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s plans to overhaul regulation are being held up by the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s current lean crew of regulators. While the Senate voted on Tuesday to confirm attorney Jay Clayton to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, the OCCâ\\x80\\x99s changing of the guard might not be so smooth. Democrats have criticized practices at OneWest, the lender created by Mnuchin after the 2008 housing crisis that foreclosed on 36,000 California families. Mnuchin hired Otting as chief executive of the bank in 2010 and he held that role until it was bought by CIT Group in 2014.  Noreikaâ\\x80\\x99s background as a lawyer who has advised banks on M&A, including Ant Financialâ\\x80\\x99s acquisition of Moneygram, as well as on the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from making speculative bets, is also controversial. â\\x80\\x9cIt is disturbing that the President is rushing to replace Mr. Curry with an acting appointee who has clear conflicts of interest, and lacks any experience in running such an important agency,â\\x80\\x9d Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. Noreikaâ\\x80\\x99s appointment does not require Senate approval. Curry, a career regulator, was appointed by the Obama administration for a five-year term that expired last month and has since been serving under an extension.  While Curry took a tough line on risky lending, the agency did come under fire for its failure to tackle a sales practice abuse scandal at Wells Fargo & Co.  The OCC is also trying to establish itself as a regulator of online lenders and financial technology firms. State authorities have argued that is their job and are suing the OCC, arguing it lacks the legal authority to offer a banking charter for technology companies. There are also three vacant spots on the Federal Reserve Board, including the post of vice chair of supervision, which will play a key role in any overhaul of bank regulation. Earlier on Wednesday, Mnuchin told a conference of community bankers that Trump had signed off on a nominee to fill the vice chair role but did not name the person. Reuters had previously reported that Randal Quarles, who worked as under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury under President George W. Bush, was a leading candidate. Mnuchin said the administration was also close to naming the two other Fed selections. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is willing to consider a small increase on the corporate tax rate if it is needed to finalize the bill in the U.S. Congress, White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said on Sunday. Mulvaney made his comments after President Donald Trump suggested on Saturday that the corporate tax rate could end up at 22 percent once the Senate and House of Representatives reconcile or â\\x80\\x9cconferenceâ\\x80\\x9d their respective versions of the legislation, even though both bills currently stand at 20 percent. â\\x80\\x9cMy understanding is that the Senate (bill) has a 20 percent rate now.

       " \"One of the biggest mysteries about the long con of Donald Trump's presidential campaign is how he has convinced millions of middle-class white Americans that he truly gives a shit about them. How can it be, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve often wondered, that a billionaire who lives in a pink-marble triplex high above Fifth Avenue, one who flies around in his own aging Boeing 757 and who owns a weekend home in Palm Beach and property in New Jersey horse country, can somehow become the hero of the people left in the wake of the new digital economy? These voters, indeed, have every right to wonder what happened to their American dream. They have every right to be worried about their livelihood and their future. They have every right to be equally terrified and aggrieved about the slow growth of the real economy, and how it has made the life that we have come to expect for generations all but unattainable.\\n\\nTrump, of course, has never quite evidenced sympathy for the common man. According to a recent bombshell report in The Washington Post, in fact, we now know that Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s own foundation reportedly spent $20,000 to purchase a six-foot portrait of Trump himself. Perhaps Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s appeal to the Rust Belt results, in part, from the fact that he is a former television star, who showed up in our living rooms every week in a fictitious corporate boardroom. Sara Flynn, a 55-year-old mother of four sons in Hebron, Kentucky, recently explained to reporters from The New York Times that she has liked Trump ever since she watched him on The Apprentice. She said that she believes Trump when he says he can â\\x80\\x9cmake America great again.â\\x80\\x9d She seemed wistful. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a bygone era, thatâ\\x80\\x99s when America was great,â\\x80\\x9d she said of the old days. â\\x80\\x9cIt hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been like that for me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI suspect part of the reason that Flynn and others like her feel an affinity for Trump is because of the promises he makes in his speeches, like the one he gave on Thursday to the Economic Club of New York, at the Waldorf Astoria hotel, which is now owned by a Chinese insurance company. The speech was likely written by one of the Reagan-era economic disciples who whisper in Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s ears these days. Maybe it was Larry Kudlow, the exâ\\x80\\x93Bear Stearns economist and CNBC veteran (he was on the dais over Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s right shoulder)? Or maybe it was Stephen Moore, formerly a columnist at The Wall Street Journal, who is now a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation? Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s words certainly sounded a bit like Reaganâ\\x80\\x99s. Fresh from his two-hour photo-op in Flint, Michigan, the day before, he told the invitation-only crowd in New York, â\\x80\\x9cIt used to be cars were made in Flint, and you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you canâ\\x80\\x99t drink the water in Flint.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s a good line, and Trump presumably knew it. He had, in fact, also used it in Flint the day before. Like some of what Trump says, it is funny. But like much of what he says, it isn't true. We make millions of cars, and car parts, in America. A recent study by the Center for Automotive Research, in fact, revealed that the auto industry accounts for about 3 percent, or nearly $75 billion, of all foreign direct investment in the United States.\\n\\nBut Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s brand depends upon fever dreams more than realities. Trump laid the promises on thick at the Waldorf. â\\x80\\x9cWe are going to turn this around,â\\x80\\x9d he continued. â\\x80\\x9cMy economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before. We reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all thatâ\\x80\\x99s left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources. Everything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTrump subsequently promised to create 25 million new jobsâ\\x80\\x94more jobs than certain credible economists believe that there will be workers to fill. He promised to cut taxes. He promised to cut regulations. He promised to repatriate the trillions of dollars in corporate profitâ\\x80\\x94he estimated the figure at $5 trillionâ\\x80\\x94and to make child-care costs tax deductible. He promised to rip up the trade agreements that he despises, NAFTA and the T.P.P. He promised that the economy, which has been stuck at around 2 percent annual economic growth for the last 10 years or so, would start growing at 3.5 percent per year, and maybe 4 percent per year if everything goes as he predicts it will. Should that happen, Trump suggested, our $600 billion annual deficit would decrease.\\n\\nHe also promised to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent. â\\x80\\x9cAn explosion of new business and new jobs will be created,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIt will be amazing to watch.â\\x80\\x9d He then engaged in a little voodoo economics. â\\x80\\x9cWe are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored,â\\x80\\x9d he said. (If Larry Kudlow is around, could he please translate that sentence into a language one of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s supporters, or even mere journalists, might understand?) Trump then promised to put coal miners and steel workers back to work, despite the fact that so many of the companies that operate in the coal sector face existential struggles; and those that operate in the steel sector are a shadow of their former selves.\",\n",

       " 'The city of Creston, in the heart of Iowa, sits nestled between State Route 25 and U.S. Highway 34, only a mile from the eastern bank of Summit Lake. The seat of Union County offers two additional lakes to fish in, the glorious Green Valley State Park, and a high school football team full of terrifyingly virulent racists.At least, Creston had that last one until Thursday. Scheduled to play the Clarinda Cardinals Friday night, the Creston Panthers will suddenly find themselves without five of their starters after a viral photo of them wearing hoods and posing with a burning cross, a rifle, and a Confederate flag, made the rounds on social media earlier this week.Clearly, the players didn t do well in history at Creston High. The location of the school in Union County is a stark reminder of which side Iowans fought for in the Civil War.The boys will probably not face legal difficulties. Being a piece of shit KKK member, or even pretending to be one, is protected under the First Amendment, and in a town of fewer than 10,000, it s not likely there s a lawyer in town who could successfully argue that anyone suffered damages as a result of their racist idiocy. Not even Kylan Smallwood, the Panthers  quarterback, who is black. Sadly, Smallwood is already all too aware of the fact that this will blow over like nothing happened once the incident is forgotten. He won t forget, though: It s a bad way to put our town on the map, but I think as a community, we just have to move past it. Deal with it, I guess. I thought these guys were my friends. Like, I ve been to some of their houses before I wanted to ask them why, why they did it, but I haven t had the chance to yet. For their part, Creston High School has said that the students have been punished in addition to their removal from the team, but has not specified what that punishment was. Coach Brian Morrison called the families of each boy personally to tell them their sons were no longer playing for the Panthers.Just another day in post-racial America.Featured image via video screen capture',\n",

       " 'BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia and the Marxist ELN rebel group said on Monday they  agreed a temporary ceasefire that would run through mid-January 2018, but it would not be in effect when Pope Francis arrives in the Andean country for a visit later this week. The ceasefire, the first with the ELN, is due to begin on Oct. 1 and end on Jan. 12, with the possibility for extensions if it is respected, President Juan Manuel Santos said in a televised address to the country.  The priority is to protect citizens, so during this period, kidnappings, attacks on oil pipelines and other hostilities against the civilian population will cease,  he said. The two sides have long said the pope s visit would be a good opportunity to call a ceasefire. The government said details and verification methods were still being finalized and that was why the ceasefire did not begin immediately. The National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group, which has bombed oil installations and kidnapped for ransom, was founded by radical Catholic priests in 1964. The ELN and government are in peace talks, currently being held in Ecuador, to end 53 years of war.   Since the talks began in February, the ELN has continued to take hostages for ransom, launch bomb attacks and extort foreign oil and mining companies. The ELN told Reuters last week that it had killed Russian-Armenian citizen Arsen Voskanyan in April.  The ELN s practice of kidnapping civilians is a key issue at the peace talks.  The ELN told Reuters last week that they were not optimistic a peace agreement could be reached because neither side would give ground on kidnapping. Pope Francis is scheduled to arrive in Colombia on Wednesday evening for a five-day visit to the cities of Bogota, Villavicencio, Medellin and Cartagena. The ELN said in a statement on its website on Monday,  We have said that the visit of Pope Francis should be an extra motivator to accelerate our work for an accord.    Once the days of celebration of the presence of Francis have passed, we will continue to insist on advancing toward the de-escalation of the conflict, until complete peace is a reality.  ',\n",

       " 'President Obama took several sharp swipes at Donald J. Trump on Sunday during a commencement address that could be the beginning of a forceful effort to help elect a Democratic successor as president. Addressing Rutgers Universityâ\\x80\\x99s class of 2016 at the schoolâ\\x80\\x99s 250th anniversary commencement, Mr. Obama never mentioned Mr. Trump by name. But his target was clear, and his assessments earned raucous cheers from the graduates. â\\x80\\x9cThe world is more interconnected than ever before, and itâ\\x80\\x99s becoming more connected every day,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama told the graduates. â\\x80\\x9cBuilding walls wonâ\\x80\\x99t change that. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has proposed building a wall between the United States and Mexico and forcing Mexico to pay for its potential multibillion dollar construction costs. Mr. Trump has also denounced much of the modern international trading and economic system, and he has proposed banning Muslim visitors and immigrants from the country, at least temporarily  â\\x80\\x94   all ideas Mr. Obama condemned on Sunday. Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump have exchanged zingers before. Mr. Trump was a leading voice questioning Mr. Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s birth location and citizenship, and Mr. Obama has responded by taking particular delight in skewering Mr. Trump. But Mr. Obama is altering his stump speech in important ways to go after Mr. Trump. As his remaining time in office draws to less than a school year, Mr. Obama has alternated between mild and mock horror, pointed humor and a touch of disbelief in his attacks on the Republican  . â\\x80\\x9cWe live in an age of global supply chains, and a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the way globalization has progressed,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said. â\\x80\\x9cBut the answer isnâ\\x80\\x99t to stop trading with other countries. In this global economy, thatâ\\x80\\x99s not even possible. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said that isolating and disparaging Muslims was not only a betrayal of American values but â\\x80\\x9cwould alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in combating violent extremism. â\\x80\\x9d Wearing a crimson robe with black sashes and a purple doctoral hood that a fierce wind kept blowing off his shoulders, Mr. Obama told the graduates that the knowledge they had earned through years of studying was something they should insist political leaders value and possess themselves. â\\x80\\x9cFacts, evidence, reason, logic, an understanding of science  â\\x80\\x94   these are good things. These are qualities you want in people making policy,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said, adding later, â\\x80\\x9cIn politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama seemed to especially take pleasure in advocating the use of facts in politics while speaking to an academic audience. His point with such arguments is usually to press for action against climate change, one of the signature policies of his administration and one that nearly all climate scientists support. But while Mr. Obama mentioned climate change, he also used his points about facts and experience to take yet another swipe at an unnamed Mr. Trump. He noted that when people get sick, they want an experienced doctor to treat them when they fly, they want experienced pilots. â\\x80\\x9cAnd yet in our public lives, we suddenly say, â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t want somebody whoâ\\x80\\x99s done it beforeâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d he asked in derision. Mr. Trump has no experience as a politician, a quality that has been viewed as one of the most important reasons for his success as a presidential candidate. Mr. Obama came to Rutgers after students, faculty members and even relatives of students spent the past three years lobbying the White House for him to speak on this anniversary for the school. â\\x80\\x9cThe truth is, Rutgers, I came here because you asked. You are the first to launch a   campaign,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cEmails, letters, tweets, YouTube videos. I even got three notes from the grandmother of your student body president,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said, drawing laughter. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I have to say that really sealed the deal. That was smart because I have a soft spot for grandmas. â\\x80\\x9d But Mr. Obama made clear that Rutgers was precisely the kind of institution that he wanted to celebrate. Last week, Mr. Obama spoke at the commencement of Howard University, a historically black university, and told the next generation of black leaders that passion must be tempered by strategic thinking and a willingness to compromise. Rutgers, one of the first nine   institutions in the American colonies, â\\x80\\x9ccould be the most diverse student body in America,â\\x80\\x9d he said. And he likened Rutgersâ\\x80\\x99 long history of success with that of the country as a whole. And while he celebrated that history, he made clear to the graduates that no period in history was as prosperous as this one. â\\x80\\x9cThe good old days werenâ\\x80\\x99t all that good,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said. â\\x80\\x9cIn fact, by almost every measure, America is better and the world is better than it was 50 years ago or 30 years ago or even eight years ago. â\\x80\\x9d One of Mr. Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s frustrations during his presidency has been the countryâ\\x80\\x99s persistently sour mood despite what he sees as a remarkable turnaround in the nationâ\\x80\\x99s economy, the passage of   health care legislation and the nationâ\\x80\\x99s   strength militarily. He cited those accomplishments and many others, including declining rates of crime, teenage pregnancy and poverty, as well as improvements in life expectancy, the status of blacks and Latinos and clean energy. â\\x80\\x9cMarriage equality is the law of the land,â\\x80\\x9d he added, to robust cheers. As he often does in such speeches, Mr. Obama told the graduates that they needed to participate in the political process and be satisfied with incremental change. Democrats generally fare better than Republicans in   elections, and while young people overwhelmingly support Democrats, they rarely vote. So Mr. Obama and Michelle Obama, the first lady, always urge student audiences to show up at the polls on Election Day. â\\x80\\x9cBecause apathy has consequences,â\\x80\\x9d the president said. He said changes, even small ones, were worth fighting for. â\\x80\\x9cI always tell my daughters, â\\x80\\x98Better is good,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Obama said near the end of his speech, adding, â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t waste your time waiting. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Finance Committee on Thursday delayed a scheduled vote on President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s nominee for U.S. Trade Representative due to the lack of a quorum among committee members. Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, the committeeâ\\x80\\x99s chairman, said he hoped the nomination of Robert Lighthizer for the administrationâ\\x80\\x99s top trade negotiating job could be taken up after Congressâ\\x80\\x99 two-week Easter break ends on April 24.     Senate confirmation of Lighthizerâ\\x80\\x99s nomination has been delayed partly by demands from Democrats that the Finance Committee first advance a bill aimed at protecting retired coal minersâ\\x80\\x99 pensions and health care benefits. Only one Democrat, Senator Ron Wyden, showed up for the start of the panelâ\\x80\\x99s meeting on Thursday. Also contributing to delays were questions over whether Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer and Reagan-era deputy USTR, needs a congressional waiver from a 1995 law prohibiting USTR candidates from working on behalf of foreign governments. After leaving USTR but well before that law was passed, Lighthizer did some work for Brazilâ\\x80\\x99s agriculture department in the late 1980s and assisted a law firm colleague who was advising a Chinese electronics industry group in the early 1990s. Lighthizer has strong support from both parties because of his pledges to strengthen enforcement of U.S. trade laws to stop unfairly dumped and subsidized imports, but the waiver issue has become a leverage point for Democrats on the minersâ\\x80\\x99 pension bill. That measure seeks to transfer certain pension obligations to the federal government and provide funding to prevent some 22,800 retired coal miners from losing healthcare benefits at the end of April. Wyden said Democratsâ\\x80\\x99 concerns needed to be addressed, but he was â\\x80\\x9cconfident that we can find a way to have a positive, strongly bipartisan markup of Mr. Lighthizer.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, proposed a bill on Tuesday to overhaul disclosure rules regarding anyone working on behalf of a foreign government, a law that has received renewed attention after Paul Manafort was indicted for violating it.  The proposed legislation, called the Disclosing Foreign Influence Act, would close loopholes in the Foreign Agents Registration Act and require the Department of Justice to develop a strategy for enforcing the law, the Republican senator said in a statement.  Manafort, a longtime Republican operative who briefly served as Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign manager in 2016, and his business associate Rick Gates, pleaded not guilty on Monday to a 12-count indictment that contained charges ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraineâ\\x80\\x99s former pro-Russian government. The current law, known as FARA, requires persons acting on behalf of a foreign government or political party to disclose to the Department of Justice their work as well as public communications taken on behalf of that client.  Critics have argued the reporting requirements for FARA are unclear and contains loopholes that allow American lobbyists to avoid disclosure of their foreign clients. â\\x80\\x9cCongress passed the Foreign Agents Registration Act to prevent inappropriate influence in domestic policy, but my oversight work has uncovered rampant disregard by foreign agents and lackluster enforcement by federal authorities,â\\x80\\x9d Grassley said in a statement.   The proposed law would clarify who is required to register, improve investigative tools, including granting authority for the Justice Department to pursue civil charges, and create new reporting requirements. FARA was first passed in 1938 in the lead up to World War II in an effort to combat German propaganda efforts and was later amended in 1966 to include lobbyists, according to the Department of Justice. As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Grassley is empowered to see that the bill quickly receives a hearing and a vote. ',\n",

       " 'Donâ\\x80\\x99t Root, Root, Root for the Racist, Red-Face Team from Cleveland Paul Thornton, Los Angeles Times, October 26, 2016 \\nHow I wish it were the Dodgers who took the field Tuesday night in Cleveland. Yes, weâ\\x80\\x99re all sad in Los Angeles that our team is now one year closer to celebrating the 30th anniversary of its last World Series appearance, but this goes beyond provincialism and wounded civil pride. \\nThe Dodgers deserved the chance to humiliate a Cleveland baseball team that not only persists in identifying itself as the â\\x80\\x9cIndians,â\\x80\\x9d but also resurrected the laughably racist, red-faced mascot Chief Wahoo just in time for the playoffs. \\nFor those who havenâ\\x80\\x99t kept up with the baseball drama, hereâ\\x80\\x99s a summary: The Cleveland team drew the curtain on its regular-season minstrel show in the spring, having replaced Chief Wahoo on its caps with a vintage red â\\x80\\x9cC.â\\x80\\x9d It never officially retired the offending mascot, but Wahoo remained confined only to uniform sleeves throughout the regular season, leading reasonable people to believe that the team ownership had finally seen the light where other franchises such as the NFLâ\\x80\\x99s Washington Redskins remained defiantly in the dark, and was easing its fans into the post-â\\x80\\x9cIndiansâ\\x80\\x9d era. \\nOr so we thought. Chief Wahoo reappeared when the Cleveland team began its impressive playoff run against the Boston Red Sox, and he hasnâ\\x80\\x99t left. He remained stitched on hats and held aloft by adoring Cleveland fans as the team convincingly defeated the Toronto Blue Jays, even surviving a legal attack by advocates of Canadaâ\\x80\\x99s indigenous peoples that threatened to forbid even so much as the use of the term â\\x80\\x9cIndiansâ\\x80\\x9d while the team was on Canadian soil. \\n{snip} \\nItâ\\x80\\x99s tempting to look past all this and take pity on a city thatâ\\x80\\x99s had it as rough as Cleveland. The Cubsâ\\x80\\x99 championship drought has famously lasted for 107 baseball seasons, but the Cleveland team boasts a pitiable 67 years without a World Series title. Beyond sports, Clevelandâ\\x80\\x99s decline as an important American metropolis is arguably unmatched, having tumbled from a population peak of 900,000-plus in 1950 to less than 400,000 today. {snip} \\nBut Cleveland? Hey, I know some generous, wonderfully caring people from that part of Ohio, which makes wishing for their teamâ\\x80\\x99s brutal defeat personally difficult. But being on the right side of a moral dispute isnâ\\x80\\x99t supposed to be easy, especially when the team in question isnâ\\x80\\x99t the evil Washington Redskins and its infernal owner, Daniel Snyder. Clevelandâ\\x80\\x99s municipal misery doesnâ\\x80\\x99t excuse the disgraceful exalting of Chief Wahoo any more than white menâ\\x80\\x99s economic hardship makes Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s popularity OK. \\n{snip}',\n",
       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - China will have to launch more ambitious renewable energy and non-fossil fuel targets and ramp up efforts to enforce them to avoid missing global climate accord requirements, two government think tanks said on Monday.  China s capacity for renewable energy, including hydro, wind and solar, will significantly exceed Beijing s own target set in the five-year plan to 2020, according to the report jointly issued by China National Renewable Energy Centre (CNREC) and the Energy Research Institute of Academy of Macroeconomic Research. The world s top energy consumer pledged to install 340 gigawatts (GW) of hydropower capacity, 210 GW of wind and 110 GW solar by 2020 in the five-year plan.  But to meet commitments agreed to in 2015 in the Paris global pact to fight climate change, China should raise its target for non-fossil fuel to 26 percent of its total energy mix from a current target of 15 percent by 2020, the report said.   The Paris agreement of reducing the global temperature by two degrees puts pressure on the short-term energy transition from coal and oil to non-fossil fuels,  said Wang Zhongying, deputy director general at CNREC. China, the world s second-largest economy, overtook the United States as the world s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in 2007.  China pledged to bring its carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 or earlier as part of a joint pledge made with the United States ahead of the 2015 Paris talks.  If current government policy is enforced properly, non-fossil fuels should account for 60 percent of energy supply by 2050, higher than an official government target of reducing coal alone to just half, the report said.  Still, getting stranded clean power in the west to urban users has been a major headache for the government as Beijing seeks wean the nation off coal, the nation s favorite fuel. An official at the National Energy Administration said at the conference on Monday he reckons the country will solve the problem of wasted energy by 2020.  Chinese authorities have been striving to improve energy efficiency and upgrade energy infrastructure by introducing measures including national carbon trade, green certificates and promoting energy storage systems.   (But) to ensure compliance with the Paris agreement, strong support to renewable energy deployment is needed on both the national and local levels,  said Wang. ',\n",

       " 'MANILA (Reuters) - The head of the Philippines  narcotics control body has resigned after just five months in the job, the second successive official to vacate the post for making statements contracting President Rodrigo Duterte. Retired army general Dionisio Santiago on Tuesday said he quit as chairman of the Dangerous Drugs Board after receiving a call from Duterte s executive secretary, a few days after he publicly said the construction of a 10,000-bed  mega drug rehab  facility was a mistake. Countering illicit drugs is the centerpiece policy of Duterte s presidency and he has repeatedly threatened to kill dealers and users and said he was willing to be jailed for it. His crackdown has killed thousands of Filipinos, but the administration insists it is committed to arresting dealers and rehabilitating users, citing the new facility and the voluntary surrender of 1.3 million addicts and pushers as a sign of its positive intent.  My rule is the boss is always right and if you think the boss is not right, refer to rule No. 1,  Santiago told Radyo Inquirer, adding he had already submitted a two-sentence resignation letter. Santiago had said the government may have miscalculated with the rehab center and should have pursued a practical community-based rehabilitation program. Fewer than 500 people have been admitted to the facility, which was launched last year amid great fanfare and was funded by a wealthy Chinese businessman. Duterte gave Santiago the job in June after the former head was forced to quit after disputing the president s repeated statements that there were more than four million Filipino drug addicts. Duterte has never disclosed the source of that information and some experts say it is exaggerated. Separately, Duterte s new health minister, Francisco Duque, on Tuesday voiced his approval for using marijuana  only for research purposes  in medicine.  He said he would prefer marijuana in  pharmaceutical form  if the country legalized its use.  If it is in raw form, it is uncontrolled, subject to abuse, addiction,  he said at his first news conference.  That is where, I believe, the risks are more profound.  There is a pending bill in Congress to legalize and regulate the medical use of cannabis. ',\n",

       " 'BARCELONA (Reuters) - Demonstrators calling for Catalan independence gathered in hundreds of towns across the region on Sunday following Madrid s actions last week to try to block a referendum on self rule that it considers illegal. Spanish police have arrested Catalan officials who were involved in organizing the Oct. 1 vote and they also seized electoral material, including ballot papers and ballot boxes. This led to several days of protests in Barcelona. But Carles Puigdemont, the head of the Catalan regional government, has said the referendum will go ahead. Several thousand protesters gathered in central Barcelona on Sunday chanting  We will vote!  and handing out ballot papers. The crowds began whistling and booing a police helicopter during speeches by the protest organizers, showing growing anger among the referendum supporters about the increased police presence. Between 3,000 and 4,000 state police officers from other regions of Spain have arrived or are on their way to Catalonia.  We feel occupied by the Spanish police,  56-year-old interior designer Nuria Gimenez said.  We ve been protesting for 10 years, we re not going to stop now with one week to go. We need to keep going until the end.  On Saturday, the state prosecutor in Catalonia told all local and national police forces they would be placed temporarily under a single chain of command and report directly to the interior ministry in Madrid. The Catalan government initially said it would refuse the order, though the head of the Catalan regional police, known as the Mossos d Esquadra, later said he would comply with prosecutors. Speaking to the crowd in Barcelona, president of the Catalan Parliament Carme Forcadell said that separatists must resist  provocations  by the central government.  They see violence in Catalonia. There has been none, nor will there be. We are a peaceful people and all we want is to exercise our rights,  Forcadell said.  Although polls show less than half of Catalonia s 5.5 million voters want self-rule, most in the wealthy northeastern region want the chance to vote on the issue. ',\n",

Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes. com. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s what you need to know: â\\x80¢ The surprise election of Donald J. Trump, a real estate    television star with no government experience, upended the political order in the United States and around the world. Global markets stabilized after an initial plunge. But uncertainty over Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s agenda, his embrace of the kind of white populism rising in Europe, and his distrust of trade pacts and climate change, raised international concerns. _____ â\\x80¢ Mr. Trump marshaled   white and   voters disaffected by globalization and multiculturalism, waging a campaign that traded in derision and attacked the legitimacy of the political process. Both Hillary Clinton and President Obama were stung by the votersâ\\x80\\x99 repudiation, but reinforced the importance of a peaceful, orderly transition of power. Mrs. Clinton, who said the loss was â\\x80\\x9cpainful, and it will be for a long time,â\\x80\\x9d also insisted that the nation owed Mr. Trump â\\x80\\x9can open mind and a chance to lead. â\\x80\\x9d _____ â\\x80¢ One party, the Republicans, will now control the White House and both houses of Congress, setting the stage for sweeping policy changes. The stunning outcome was unforeseen, undercutting the credibility of much of the American news media. Like the â\\x80\\x9cBrexitâ\\x80\\x9d referendum, much of the polling, analysis and prominent coverage failed to capture the level of popular fury or foresee the coming revolt against the interests of what the British politician Nigel Farage derided as â\\x80\\x9cbig business and big politics. â\\x80\\x9d _____ â\\x80¢ Both Russia and China have portrayed the tumultuous American election as a validation of their own authoritarian approaches. Vladimir V. Putin expressed hope for a â\\x80\\x9cconstructive dialogueâ\\x80\\x9d with Mr. Trump, whose lack of foreign policy experience and friendly positions toward Russia could play into the Kremlinâ\\x80\\x99s hands. Asia greeted the election cautiously. China sent a short congratulatory note, but made no mention of Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign promises to confront it on trade and currency issues. Shinzo Abe, Japanâ\\x80\\x99s prime minister, could meet with the   as early as next week. â\\x80¢ Newspapers across the globe scrambled to create front pages that conveyed the stunning upset. [The New York Times] â\\x80¢ If Mr. Trump scraps the   Trade Partnership, a proper counterweight to Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s expansion may never emerge. [The Straits Times] â\\x80¢ Asian analysts fear that Mr. Trump will overhaul bilateral defense pacts with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia. [Nikkei Asian Review] â\\x80¢ Mr. Trump has said he will â\\x80\\x9cend foreverâ\\x80\\x9d the use of the   visa that is employed by American companies to hire skilled workers from India and other countries. [Times of India] â\\x80¢ Weeks before the election, President Rodrigo Duterte named Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s business partner in Manila as a special envoy to the United States. [The New York Times] â\\x80¢ Silicon Valleyâ\\x80\\x99s reaction to Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s victory was beyond grim. â\\x80\\x9cWe didnâ\\x80\\x99t do enough,â\\x80\\x9d said one tech leader. [The New York Times] â\\x80¢  California and Massachusetts legalized recreational marijuana use, reflecting a national shift in attitudes toward the drug. [The New York Times] â\\x80¢ The one American institution that predicted Mr. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s presidency: â\\x80\\x9cThe Simpsons. â\\x80\\x9d [Entertainment Weekly] â\\x80¢ The markets have recovered from a wild ride, with stocks trading higher in the U. S. and in early trading in Asia. Gold pared earlier gains. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s a snapshot of global markets. â\\x80¢ The Mexican peso took a beating, dropping more than 12 percent against the dollar before recovering to 8 percent. â\\x80¢ In other news, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India arrives in Japan today for a   visit during which the two countries may complete negotiations on a nuclear energy deal. â\\x80¢ Disney reports quarterly results today, which could offer a look into the performance of the massive new resort it opened in Shanghai this year. â\\x80¢ In Hong Kong, highly competitive â\\x80\\x9ccramming centersâ\\x80\\x9d for exam preparations are turning their tutors into celebrities, plastering their faces on buses and billboards. â\\x80¢ Sharbat Gula, the   Afghan who appeared as a girl on a National Geographic cover, was welcomed home by Afghanistanâ\\x80\\x99s president after Pakistan deported her. She has come to symbolize the plight of hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees and migrants being forced to return. â\\x80¢ President Xi Jinpingâ\\x80\\x99s attitudes toward law and sovereignty were apparent in Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s decision to target two   politicians in Hong Kong who used the term â\\x80\\x9c â\\x80\\x9d in taking their oaths of office. â\\x80¢ At least seven people died and dozens were injured when a tram derailed south of London. The cause was unclear, but the driver was arrested. â\\x80¢ Roughly 50, 000 years ago, the Neanderthals and modern humans encountered one another and interbred. So why didnâ\\x80\\x99t a   hybrid prevail? Two new studies focus on this question and find that a principle of population genetics applies: In small populations, natural selection is less effective. We recently told you how autumn  â\\x80\\x94   or is it fall?  â\\x80\\x94   got its identity crisis. But what about summer, spring and winter? Where do their names come from? Etymologists link â\\x80\\x9cwinterâ\\x80\\x9d to the    word wed, meaning â\\x80\\x9cwater. â\\x80\\x9d That gave way to the old German wintar, or â\\x80\\x9cthe wet season. â\\x80\\x9d Water also leads us to the source of springâ\\x80\\x99s name. In this case, the word was a verb before it was a noun. In the Middle Ages, â\\x80\\x9csprincâ\\x80\\x9d was German for â\\x80\\x9cleapâ\\x80\\x9d and it came to mean â\\x80\\x9csource of water. â\\x80\\x9d Eventually â\\x80\\x9cspringing timeâ\\x80\\x9d replaced the Old English â\\x80\\x9clent,â\\x80\\x9d which had signified the entire spring season, not just the period from Ash Wednesday to Easter. It shrank down to â\\x80\\x9cspringtime,â\\x80\\x9d then â\\x80\\x9cspring. â\\x80\\x9d And while autumn now has two names, summer may originally have had none at all. Thousands of years ago, early   cultures are thought to have divided the year into just three seasons. At some point, the Sanskrit â\\x80\\x9csÃ¡ma,â\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cseason,â\\x80\\x9d appears to have traveled north from the Indian subcontinent  â\\x80\\x94   a place that knows a thing or two about sweltering months  â\\x80\\x94   and became summer.

       " 'WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s administration accused Russia on Tuesday of trying to shield Syriaâ\\x80\\x99s government from blame for a deadly gas attack, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson brought a Western message to Moscow condemning its support for President Bashar al-Assad. Trump, who has faced criticism for lacking a broader strategy to deal with the Syria crisis, insisted he has no plans to â\\x80\\x9cgo intoâ\\x80\\x9d the war-torn country. Senior White House officials, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said Assadâ\\x80\\x99s government carried out the April 4 sarin nerve gas attack on civilians in Syriaâ\\x80\\x99s Idlib province that killed 87 people, including many children, to put pressure on rebels making advances in the area. Russia has defended the Syrian leader against U.S. allegations that his forces carried out the attack, saying there was no evidence. Russia has blamed Syrian rebels. * COMMENTARY: Why Assad used chemical weapons  reut.rs/2o5FMEV * COMMENTARY: The worrying lessons of the Syria chemical attack reut.rs/2o6r55r â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s clear that the Russians are trying to cover up what happened there,â\\x80\\x9d one White House official said. White House spokesman Sean Spicer later told reporters that the facts backed up the U.S. version of events. â\\x80\\x9cRussia is on an island when it comes to its support of Syria or its lack of, frankly, acknowledgment of what happened,â\\x80\\x9d he told reporters. However, at the same briefing, Spicer drew criticism after he sought to underscore the ghastliness of the gas attack by saying: â\\x80\\x9cYou had someone as despicable as Hitler who didnâ\\x80\\x99t even sink to using chemical weapons.â\\x80\\x9d Nazi Germany used gas chambers to kill millions of Jews during the Holocaust. Spicer later apologized and said he should not have made the comparison. â\\x80\\x9cIt was a mistake. I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have done it and I wonâ\\x80\\x99t do it again,â\\x80\\x9d Spicer told CNN in an interview. â\\x80\\x9cIt was inappropriate and insensitive.â\\x80\\x9d The White House officials said Russia has frequently offered multiple, conflicting accounts of Syrian government aggression including the incident in the village of Khan Sheikhoun to sow doubt within the international community. The United States launched 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield on Thursday to retaliate after the attack. The strikes thrust Trump, who came to power in January calling for warmer ties with Russia, and his administration into confrontation with Moscow. Chinese President Xi Jinping told Trump in a telephone call on Wednesday that â\\x80\\x9cany use of chemical weapons is unacceptableâ\\x80\\x9d and urged a political solution for Syria, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said of the telephone exchange. â\\x80\\x9c(We) must persevere with moving towards a political solution for the Syria issue. It is very important that the United Nations Security CouncilÂ\\xa0maintains unity on the Syria issue. (I) hope the Security Council can speak with a single voice,â\\x80\\x9d CCTV cited Xi as saying.Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said on Tuesday she thought Russia knew about the chemical attack in advance. â\\x80\\x9cThey didnâ\\x80\\x99t look shocked. They didnâ\\x80\\x99t look surprised. They were so quick to defend. And then the evidence comes out, and we see exactly what it is and we know exactly what the environment was. Then you realize,â\\x80\\x9d she said on CNN. U.S. intelligence indicates that the chemical agent in the attack was delivered by Syrian Su-22 aircraft that took off from the Shayrat airfield, according to a White House report given to reporters. In a four-page document, the White House sought to rebut many of Moscowâ\\x80\\x99s claims about the circumstances of the attack. It said the Syrian planes were in the vicinity of Khan Sheikhoun about 20 minutes before the attack and left shortly afterward. â\\x80\\x9cAdditionally, our information indicates personnel historically associated with Syriaâ\\x80\\x99s chemical weapons program were at Shayrat airfield in late March making preparations for an upcoming attack in northern Syria, and they were present at the airfield on the day of the attack,â\\x80\\x9d the report said. Washington wants Russia to stop supporting Assad, who has been fighting a six-year-long civil war against mostly Sunni Muslim rebels, also with the backing of Shiâ\\x80\\x99ite Muslim Iran. Tillerson carried a message from world powers to Moscow denouncing Russian support for Assad, as the Trump administration took on Americaâ\\x80\\x99s traditional mantle as leader of a unified West. Tillerson earlier met foreign ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies and Middle Eastern allies in Italy. They endorsed a joint call for Russia to abandon Assad.         â\\x80\\x9cIt is clear to us the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,â\\x80\\x9d Tillerson told reporters in Italy. â\\x80\\x9cWe hope that the Russian government concludes that they have aligned themselves with an unreliable partner in Bashar al-Assad.â\\x80\\x9d He said Russia had failed in its role as sponsor of a 2013 deal in which Assad promised to give up chemical weapons. Russia says the chemicals that killed civilians last week belonged to rebels, not Assadâ\\x80\\x99s government, and accused the United States of an illegal aggression on a false pretext.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday he believed Washington planned more missile strikes, and that rebels were planning to stage chemical weapons attacks to provoke them.  â\\x80\\x9cWe have information that a similar provocation is being prepared ... in other parts of Syria including in the southern Damascus suburbs where they are planning to again plant some substance and accuse the Syrian authorities of usingâ\\x80\\x9d chemical weapons, Putin said. Trump denied further plans in Syria. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re not going into Syria,â\\x80\\x9d he said in an interview with the New York Post. â\\x80\\x9cOur policy is the same; it hasnâ\\x80\\x99t changed. Weâ\\x80\\x99re not going into Syria.â\\x80\\x9d A senior Trump administration official called Putinâ\\x80\\x99s remarks part of a Russian â\\x80\\x9cdisinformation campaign.â\\x80\\x9d The United States, Britain and France have proposed a revised draft resolution to the 15-member U.N. Security Council similar to a text they circulated last week pushing Syriaâ\\x80\\x99s government to cooperate with investigators.     The secretary of stateâ\\x80\\x99s role as messenger for a united G7 position is a turning point for Trump, who in the past alarmed allies by voicing skepticism about the value of U.S. support for traditional friends, while calling for closer ties with Moscow. Tillerson is a former chairman of oil company Exxon Mobil Corp, which has gigantic projects in Russia. Putin awarded him Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cOrder of Friendshipâ\\x80\\x9d in 2013. He is due to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Wednesday. The Kremlin has said Tillerson has no meeting scheduled with Putin this trip, although some Russian media have reported such a meeting could take place.  Western countries have been calling for Assadâ\\x80\\x99s departure since 2011, the start of a civil war that has killed at least 400,000 people and created the worldâ\\x80\\x99s worst refugee crisis. Assadâ\\x80\\x99s position on the battlefield became far stronger after Russia joined the war to support him in 2015. The United States and its allies are conducting air strikes in Syria against Islamic State, but until last week Washington had avoided targeting forces of Assadâ\\x80\\x99s government directly. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday the United Statesâ\\x80\\x99 military policy in Syria had not changed and remains focused on defeating Islamic State. ',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday called for surveillance of mosques as part of U.S. law enforcement efforts to prevent terrorism, and stood by his remarks on banning Muslim immigrants, which others in his party have criticized. Trump repeated his call for a temporary ban on the entry of Muslims into the United States after a U.S.-born Muslim, the son of Afghan immigrants, fatally shot 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando early on Sunday. The New York real estate developer said that while the Florida gunman was born in the United States, â\\x80\\x9chis parents werenâ\\x80\\x99t and his ideas werenâ\\x80\\x99t born here.â\\x80\\x9d  â\\x80\\x9cWe have to maybe check, respectfully, the mosques and we have to check other places because this is a problem that, if we donâ\\x80\\x99t solve it, itâ\\x80\\x99s going to eat our country alive,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said at a rally in Atlanta. Trump had called for surveillance of mosques in November, as well as a database of Syrian refugees entering the United States. The Orlando gunman, Omar Mateen, is believed by authorities to have acted alone, inspired by radical ideology he was exposed to over the internet. â\\x80\\x9cAny kind of extremism and violence is not preached in American mosques,â\\x80\\x9d said Ibrahim Hooper, communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. â\\x80\\x9cIn fact, research has shown that mosques are a moderating influence on individuals who attend.â\\x80\\x9d Prominent Republicans this week distanced themselves from Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s comments about Muslims.  House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday he did not think a ban on the entry of Muslims was in U.S. interests. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination and has been a fierce critic since, said that he was â\\x80\\x9cunnervedâ\\x80\\x9d by Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s response. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said on Wednesday that Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s rhetoric had grown â\\x80\\x9ceven more inflammatoryâ\\x80\\x9d in recent days. She said the United States counts on Muslim communities in the U.S. and partners in majority-Muslim countries to help fight terrorism. â\\x80\\x9cNot one of Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s reckless ideas would have saved a single life in Orlando,â\\x80\\x9d Clinton said at an event for U.S. military families in Virginia. Trump on Monday proposed that the United States suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is â\\x80\\x9ca proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats.â\\x80\\x9d He also said radical Muslims were entering the country amid a flood of refugees and â\\x80\\x9ctrying to take over our children.â\\x80\\x9d Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s hard-line proposals on immigration have contributed to his popularity among some conservative voters. But they have also triggered condemnation from minority and human rights activists and his political opponents, many of whom have called his rhetoric racist. The New York businessman also said in Atlanta he would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un if he came to the United States, and he dismissed the controversy he caused in May when he said in a Reuters interview he would be willing to speak to Kim. â\\x80\\x9cIf he came here, Iâ\\x80\\x99d accept him. But I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t give a state dinner like we do for China and all these other people  that rip us off,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump plans to pick businessman  William Hagerty as the next U.S. ambassador to Japan, an adviser to Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s transition team told Reuters on Wednesday. Japanâ\\x80\\x99s Nikkei news service reported that Trump would soon announce the choice of Hagerty, the director of presidential appointments in his transition team. The adviser who spoke to Reuters confirmed the Nikkei report on condition of anonymity. Hagerty is a Tennessee native who founded a private equity firm, Hagerty Peterson. He spent several years in Japan with the Boston Consulting Group management consultancy and later served in the White House of former President George H.W. Bush. He will replace Caroline Kennedy, who has held the position since 2013. Japanâ\\x80\\x99s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, declined to comment on the report since the choice has yet to be formally announced, saying only that he hoped the new ambassador would be able to develop a friendly U.S.-Japan relationship. Others said that while the extent of Hagertyâ\\x80\\x99s knowledge of diplomacy and regional politics remained unknown and could be a concern, the choice suggests Trump is prioritizing economics in bilateral ties, which may relieve officials concerned by his protectionist stance on trade during the presidential campaign.   Japanese companies play a key role in the U.S. economy, employing more than 800,000 American workers. They contributed $78 billion to U.S. exports in 2014, according to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. Koichi Hori, the chairman of consulting firm Dream Incubator Inc and a former president of Boston Consulting in Japan, who worked with Hagerty in the early 1990s, termed him a pragmatist who might not always toe Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s conservative line on trade. â\\x80\\x9cRather than doing that, he might advise Trump that if he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t think of other countries more, it ultimately may not benefit the United States,â\\x80\\x9d Hori added. A long-time U.S. resident of Tokyo with knowledge of business and politics who knows Hagerty by reputation, but not personally, said he had a reputation as a â\\x80\\x9ctypical management consultant - logical, thoughtful, and has no patience for trade rhetoric.â\\x80\\x9d The news was likely to reassure officials at the Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) as well as the Ministry of Finance (MOF), he added.  â\\x80\\x9cThe boys at the U.S. Defense Department and the Defense Agency may be disappointed because of his lack of experience in the geopolitical aspects of the U.S.-Japan relationship, but METI, MOF and everyone else here in Tokyo should be breathing a sign of relief,â\\x80\\x9d he added.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump defended his order to temporarily bar entry to people from seven majority-Muslim nations, which has come under intense criticism at home and abroad, saying on Thursday it was crucial to ensuring religious freedom and tolerance in America. Trump, speaking at a prayer breakfast attended by politicians, faith leaders and guests including Jordanâ\\x80\\x99s King Abdullah, said he wanted to prevent a â\\x80\\x9cbeachhead of intoleranceâ\\x80\\x9d from spreading in the United States. â\\x80\\x9cThe world is in trouble, but weâ\\x80\\x99re going to straighten it out, OK? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I do - I fix things,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said in his speech. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s executive order a week ago put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The measure, which Trump says is aimed at protecting the country from terrorist attacks, has drawn protests and legal challenges. Trump, a wealthy businessman and former reality TV star who had never previously held public office when he was sworn in on Jan. 20, also sought to reassure the large crowd about the nature of his phone calls with world leaders. The Washington Post said Trump had a tense call with Australiaâ\\x80\\x99s Prime Minister about his immigration order. â\\x80\\x9cBelieve me, when you hear about the tough phone calls Iâ\\x80\\x99m having - donâ\\x80\\x99t worry about it. Just donâ\\x80\\x99t worry about it,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. He did not specify which calls he was referring to. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not going to happen anymore,â\\x80\\x9d said Trump, who campaigned on a stance of â\\x80\\x9cAmerica firstâ\\x80\\x9d that he said would ensure the country was not taken advantage of in its trade or other foreign relations. Trump said violence against religious minorities must end.   â\\x80\\x9cAll nations have a moral obligation to speak out against such violence. All nations have a duty to work together to confront it, and to confront it viciously, if we have to,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Trump said the United States has taken â\\x80\\x9cnecessary actionâ\\x80\\x9d in recent days to protect religious liberty in the United States, referring to his immigration action. Critics of the measure have accused him of violating the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom, because the designated countries are majority-Muslim, and of slamming the door shut to refugees. Trump has said the move was necessary to ensure a more thorough vetting of people coming into the United States.  â\\x80\\x9cOur nation has the most generous immigration system in the world. There are those who would exploit that generosity to undermine the values that we hold so dear,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said. â\\x80\\x9cThere are those who would seek to enter our country for the purpose of spreading violence, or oppressing other people based upon their faith or their lifestyle - not right. We will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread in our nation,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Trump said his administrationâ\\x80\\x99s new system would ensure that people entering the United States embrace U.S. values including religious liberty. He also pledged to get rid of the â\\x80\\x9cJohnson Amendment,â\\x80\\x9d a tax provision that prevents tax-exempt charities like churches from being involved in political campaigns. The White House said on Wednesday it has issued updated guidance on the travel order clarifying that legal permanent residents, or green card holders, from the designated countries require no waiver to enter the United States.

       " \"This is what it has come to.Following the passage of a Republican-drafted bill to force guns onto college campuses   whether the schools want them there or not   the University of Houston has begun instructing professors to avoid literally triggering students who may be armed in order to avoid sparking a mass shooting. If that sounds ridiculously unhealthy, glad you could join us.In 2015, Republicans in the Texas legislature and Governor Greg Abbott forced through an NRA-drafted bill that would make it mandatory for schools in the state to allow guns on campus. As much as it was adored by right-wing gun lovers, educators and students were appalled. The implications are scary. Students will be packed into classrooms with any number of weapons just waiting to go off by accident or by design.Schools are preparing for the new  guns everywhere  law that will take effect in August, and much of the preparation centers around getting teachers ready to deal with classrooms full of 18-year-olds who brought a semi-automatic handgun to campus along with their textbooks. In a recent discussion of the new state law, the University of Houston displayed a slide that told faculty to  not  go there'  on certain topics if they felt it might make some of their gun-happy students upset.Slide from recent campus carry dialogue at UH, in response to faculty concerns about dangers from armed students: pic.twitter.com/610RyhDZlf  Jeff (@JeffintheBowtie) February 22, 2016USA TODAY spoke with the university s faculty senate president: My slides are not university policy but faculty to faculty discussion points in a faculty senate led discussion group. They express the downside of having more weapons on campus and the chilling effect that has on academic freedom,  University Faculty Senate President Jon Snow tells USA TODAY College regarding his presentation.Ironically, many right-wingers have accused schools of  censoring  free speech by being overly  politically correct  in the classroom. It s hard to imagine any school has gone as far as Texas s Republican-led legislature. Professors may be worried students could get offended by a lecture, but few schools have to tell their professors to avoid  triggering  their students or else risk being shot in their classroom.Needless to say, many professors are not okay with this new way of doing things.Despite Republicans assuring the public that they are doing this to keep people safe, the students and professors themselves want nothing to do with this terrifying plan. It s led to demonstrations by students at schools like the University of Texas at Austin, and now, an unprecedented 168 professors from over 30 departments have signed a pledge that they will not take part in this bone-headed scheme.Republicans have ignored their concerns entirely. Instead, they are high-fiving the NRA lobbyists who put them up to it. So a few more kids might die in Texas schools? It s a small price to pay for  freedom. Featured image via Twitter\",\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday struck down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of abortion rights in America in more than two decades. The 5-3 ruling held that the Republican-backed 2013 Texas law placed an undue burden on women exercising their right under the U.S. Constitution to end a pregnancy, established in the courtâ\\x80\\x99s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The abortion providers who challenged the law said it was medically unnecessary and specifically intended to shut clinics.  Texas officials said it was intended to protect womenâ\\x80\\x99s health. The ruling means similar laws in other states are probably unconstitutional and could put in jeopardy other types of abortion restrictions enacted in various conservative states. â\\x80\\x9cThe decision should send a loud signal to politicians that they can no longer hide behind sham rationales to shut down clinics and prevent a woman who has decided to end a pregnancy from getting the care she needs,â\\x80\\x9d said Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. President Barack Obama, whose administration backed the abortion providers in the court challenge, said in a statement he was â\\x80\\x9cpleased to see the Supreme Court protect womenâ\\x80\\x99s rights and healthâ\\x80\\x9d and that restrictions like those in Texas â\\x80\\x9charm womenâ\\x80\\x99s health and place an unconstitutional obstacle in the path of a womanâ\\x80\\x99s reproductive freedom.â\\x80\\x9d Conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy joined the courtâ\\x80\\x99s four liberal members in the ruling, with the remaining three conservatives dissenting. The court declared that both key provisions of the law - requiring abortion doctors to have  difficult-to-obtain â\\x80\\x9cadmitting privilegesâ\\x80\\x9d at a local hospital and requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities - violated a womanâ\\x80\\x99s right to an abortion. Writing for the court, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said, â\\x80\\x9cWe conclude that neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cEach places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a pre-viability abortion, each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access, and each violates the federal Constitution,â\\x80\\x9d Breyer added. Deferring to state legislatures over â\\x80\\x9cquestions of medical uncertainty is also inconsistent with this courtâ\\x80\\x99s case law,â\\x80\\x9d Breyer added. The ruling in the case, Whole Womanâ\\x80\\x99s Health v. Hellerstedt, represented the most vigorous affirmation of abortion rights in the United States since a 1992 ruling affirmed a womanâ\\x80\\x99s right to have the procedure. On a warm sunny summer day, hundreds of people on both sides of the issue converged on the Supreme Court building, with abortion rights advocates dancing and celebrating after the ruling. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re ecstatic. The reality is today women won,â\\x80\\x9d abortion rights activist Marcela Howell said. The law was passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor in 2013. Ten states currently have admitting privileges requirements on the books while six have laws requiring hospital-grade facilities. Lower courts have blocked admitting privileges provisions in five states and halted facilities regulations in two states.  â\\x80\\x9cThe decision erodes statesâ\\x80\\x99 lawmaking authority to safeguard the health and safety of women and subjects more innocent life to being lost. Texasâ\\x80\\x99 goal is to protect innocent life, while ensuring the highest health and safety standards for women,â\\x80\\x9d Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott said. Since the law was passed, the number of abortion clinics in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people, had dropped from 41 to 19. The Supreme Court has appeals pending in two cases involving admitting privilege laws in Mississippi and Wisconsin on which it could act as soon as Tuesday. Â\\xa0Â\\xa0Â\\xa0 The Texas law required abortion doctors to have â\\x80\\x9cadmitting privileges,â\\x80\\x9d a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic so they can treat patients needing surgery or other critical care. The law also required clinic buildings to possess costly, hospital-grade facilities. These regulations covered numerous building features such as corridor width, the swinging motion of doors, floor tiles, parking spaces, elevator size, ventilation, electrical wiring, plumbing, floor tiling and even the angle that water flows from drinking fountains. Americans remain closely divided over whether abortion should be legal. In a Reuters/Ipsos online poll involving 6,769 U.S. adults conducted from June 3 to June 22, 47 percent of respondents said abortion generally should be legal and 42 percent said it generally should be illegal. Views on abortion in the United States have changed very little over the decades, according to historical polling data. The last time the justices decided a major abortion case was nine years ago when they ruled 5-4 to uphold a federal law banning a late-term abortion procedure. Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Womanâ\\x80\\x99s Health, which led the challenge to the Texas law, said, â\\x80\\x9cEvery day Whole Womanâ\\x80\\x99s Health treats our patients with compassion, respect and dignity - and today the Supreme Court did the same. Weâ\\x80\\x99re thrilled that today justice was served and our clinics stay open.â\\x80\\x9d Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Twitter called the ruling â\\x80\\x9ca victory for women in Texas and across America.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThis fight isnâ\\x80\\x99t over: The next president has to protect womenâ\\x80\\x99s health. Women wonâ\\x80\\x99t be â\\x80\\x98punishedâ\\x80\\x99 for exercising their basic rights,â\\x80\\x9d she said, a dig at presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who once suggested women who get illegal abortions should face â\\x80\\x9csome sort of punishment.â\\x80\\x9d The presidential election is Nov. 8. Some U.S. states have pursued a variety of restrictions on abortion, including banning certain types of procedures, prohibiting it after a certain number of weeks of gestation, requiring parental permission for girls until a certain age, imposing waiting periods or mandatory counseling, and others. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s exceedingly unfortunate that the court has taken the ability to protect womenâ\\x80\\x99s health out of the hands of Texas citizens and their duly-elected representatives,â\\x80\\x9d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in a statement. Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito dissented. The normally nine-justice court was one member short after the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who consistently opposed abortion in past rulings. ',\n",
       " 'Hallowe\\'en - The Day of the Aos Si 31.10.2016 And so the agricultural year dies, the underworld and our world reach the same level and there begins the time of the crossing of spirits from below to above, walking among us through the darkness of Winter. Hence the need to light fires and celebrate with festivals of light, hence the children dressed up as demons and ghouls. Humankind 2016, repeating prehistoric rites. Hallowe\\'en, the Day of the Witches, All Hallows\\' Evening, Samhain. Day of the Dead. Pumpkins, chestnuts, new wine, mulled wine. A bonfire, to keep away the evil spirits, the Aos SÃ\\xad and to bring the community together, the first festival of light in the dark winter with little or no agricultural produce. What is the meaning of all these symbols? The end, or death, of the agricultural year in Europe happens around this time and as the centuries wore on, the Celtic peoples (and probably others) stipulated that at sunset on October 31 begins Samhain (pronounced So\\'win). This was a \"boundary time\" when the Aos SÃ\\xad (bad spirits) could move easily from the underworld into our world and so bonfires were lit to cleanse the Earth from evil and to protect communities against it. Print version Font Size From the earliest times, children would go \"mumming\" or \"guising\", wearing disguises as monsters, witches or bad spirits, going from door to door asking for offerings of food and drink - or else people placed these outside their homes for the Aos SÃ\\xad to take and be appeased. A time of darkness and uncertainty It was a time of darkness and uncertainty, a time when survival depended on how much food had been stored from the harvest and in what conditions it was in, a time when the wine or beer barrel was opened and which hopefully would last until Spring. It was a time when the fattened pig would be slaughtered and salted, when sausages would be made, hams smoked. It was a time before the potato, which was brought to Europe from the region of the Andes in the sixteenth century. What substituted the potato at the time was the chestnut, especially in Southern Europe, where a chestnut festivity took place at the beginning of November around a Magnus Ustus, a Great Bonfire. As with Samhain , the date became institutionalized and was fixed on November 11, the Day of Saint Martin. Medieval festivals carried across the waters In Medieval times, these festivities were still very popular in Europe and were carried over to the Americas by the Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (rest of Latin America), French and British (North America), where they continued, while they became less popular in Europe and were celebrated locally by communities. In some cases, they took on a different meaning, as was the case with Guy Fawkes\\' Night, or Bonfire Night, in the United Kingdom. Guy Fawkes, an English Catholic, was part of a plot to blow up barrels of gunpowder under the House of Parliament when it was to be opened by King James VI of Scotland, James I of England (who became King of both countries upon the death of Queen Elizabeth I in 1603), on November 5, 1605. The plot was discovered, Guy Fawkes committed suicide just before he was hanged (he jumped from the gallows and broke his neck) and since then the day has been remembered throughout the UK with fireworks, bonfires, chestnuts and a stuffed doll representing the \"Guy\", children wheeling the doll around the villages asking for \"A penny for the Guy\". But this does not begin in 1605 - as we see, the symbology is the same as that coming from ancient times and the burning of the guy resembles the burning of the scarecrow in Iberian communities around this time. Humankind 2016, repeating age-old rites just because it is what you do at this time of year. You dress up, you light a fire, you dance, you celebrate, you go singing round people\\'s homes. But you also come together and the community regulates itself during the darkest and most dangerous months of the year. A good example, togetherness. It is a pity that with all the resources at our disposal, we cannot perpetuate such moments throughout the year. Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey',\n",

The commission said that ballots would be re-cast in two polling places in Nimba County due to irregularities, although that measure only concerns a few thousand votes. Weah became the first non-European to win the European player of the year award in 1995, the same year he picked up the African and World player of the year awards.  He finished runner-up to Johnson Sirleaf in a 2005 election that helped draw a line under years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of civilians. He has been a senator for the opposition CDC party since 2014. Boakai, the former head of Liberia s petroleum refinery company and agriculture minister, has served as Liberia s vice president since 2006 and represents the ruling Unity Party.  Brumskine has said the vote was marred by fraud and that he would request a re-run. However, he has yet to produce evidence of cheating and international observers said they saw no major problems.  Johnson Sirleaf s 12 years in office have seen the consolidation of Liberia s post-war peace and the quadrupling in size of the national economy. However, many Liberians complain about poor public services and widespread corruption and say they are eager for a new president. Weah s strong first-round performance drew mixed reactions on the streets of Monrovia, the capital. One woman held a small radio close to her ear as the latest results were read out by the state broadcaster.  We will see a new president now come next year,  she said.  Our son Weah will be the next president.  Standing nearby, a man in his late 50s, Cyrus S. Mulbah, had a different view.  It will be a sad mistake if this country goes in the hands of Weah and his people,  he said  This is not a football field.   ',\n",
       " 'Former Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel has gone from one of the most celebrated players in the NFL to washing out. Now, he is appearing in shopping malls to sign photos for money to make ends meet. [As USA Today notes, Manziel will make a Super Bowl appearance of sorts by appearing at a Houston shopping mall during Super Bowl week to sign autographs.

       " 'MELITOPOL, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russia has left troops behind after staging war games in Belarus despite promising not to, Ukraine s Commander in Chief Viktor Muzhenko told Reuters. In an interview on a military plane on Thursday evening, Muzhenko said Russia has withdrawn only a few units from Belarus and had lied about how many of its soldiers were there in the first place.  His comments could increase tension between the two neighbors and contradict the Belarussian defense ministry spokesman, who said the last train of Russian troops and equipment had left Belarus on Thursday. Russia s defense ministry did not respond to an immediate request for comment. Relations between Kiev and Moscow nosedived after Russia s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and the outbreak of a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people.  Ukraine sees itself as being at war with Russia and has accused Moscow of sending troops and hardware to fight in the Donbass region, which Moscow denies. There are frequent casualties despite a notional ceasefire agreed in 2015.  The Zapad wargames, held by Russian and Belarussian troops on territory in both countries in September, are a new source of concern for neighboring Ukraine and NATO member states on Europe s eastern flank.  Russia has said the exercise was to rehearse a purely defensive scenario, that the scale of the wargames was in line with international rules, and that allegations it was a springboard to invade Poland, Lithuania or Ukraine were false. But Muzhenko said the wargames were of an offensive nature. Ukraine staged its own drills in northern Ukraine in response to Zapad and built up troops there.   I wouldn t say that the tension has lessened. We can say tension is building up or rising,  he said.   We had information that they had withdrawn only a few units of the declared 12,500 troops, of which 3,000 were Russians, but there were significantly more of them there.  Muzhenko said the Russians had withdrawn air units from Belarus to make a show of leaving.  Russia demonstrated, and it was primarily a demonstration, the return of aviation units   they took off from the airfields and flew to airfields in Russia. But we understand that 300-400 km for aviation is a distance that can be overcome in a very short time,  he said.   The 55-year-old, who became Chief of the General Staff in 2014, said Ukraine was still outgunned in terms of its air defense capabilities in the Donbass war and needed air reconnaissance and anti-missile systems.  Kiev is hoping to receive lethal defensive weapons from U.S. President Donald Trump. Muzhenko said talks had been concluded.  We expect the corresponding decision because all negotiations are over and the relevant issues have been agreed   on the list and types of weapons   and we expect only the political decisions of our partner countries,  he said.

       " 'NICE, France  â\\x80\\x94   It was the first and last fireworks show in this seaside city that    Yanis Coviaux ever saw. He died in the carnage Thursday night. So did Brodie Copeland, 11, who was visiting from the United States. Haroun El Kamel, 12, survived but might never look at fireworks the same way. Then there was Laura Borla, 14, who came to see the fireworks with her twin sister and their mother but was separated from them in the chaos. After days of searching frantically for her, Lauraâ\\x80\\x99s family learned on Sunday morning that she was dead. â\\x80\\x9cWe miss you already we will love you always,â\\x80\\x9d her    sister, Lucie, said in a Facebook post. The driver who plowed his truck into crowds at the conclusion of the Bastille Day fireworks in Nice killed at least 84 people and injured hundreds more. The trauma was exacerbated by the presence of a large number of children, whose deaths, injuries and psychological scars gave this attack  â\\x80\\x94   like the one in March that killed many children at a park in Pakistan, or the recent slaughter of families celebrating the end of Ramadan in Baghdad  â\\x80\\x94   an especially brutal feel and underscored its indiscriminate cruelty. At least 10 children were killed Thursday night, and at least 35 were treated for injuries at hospitals in Nice. Others were separated from their parents in the chaos, and some no doubt saw and heard things they might carry with them for a long time. No one who was visiting the waterfront that night could have imagined such a horrific ending. Going to the fireworks on July 14 is an annual family ritual in Nice, a time for picnics on the beach  â\\x80\\x94   and, when the beach is too full, for spreading tablecloths on the meridian of the waterfront road known for more than 150 years as the Promenade des Anglais. From there, people have a fine view of the sea and the extravagant fireworks display. â\\x80\\x9cYou have to bring your children because if you donâ\\x80\\x99t, you will pay for it all year  â\\x80\\x94   all their friends are there,â\\x80\\x9d said Raja El Kamel, 43, Harounâ\\x80\\x99s mother, who was with him and a close friend from Sweden and her two children to watch the festivities. In a city that enjoys a party, the July 14 fireworks are especially beloved because the entire community joins in: Christian and Muslim, religious and secular, but French above all. The presence of large numbers of tourists gives the evening even more of a festive feel. For    Yanis and his parents, Mickael and Samira Coviaux, the evening was a first. The parents, both truck drivers, live in Grenoble, and this was their first time seeing the July 14 fireworks on the Mediterranean as a family, said Yanisâ\\x80\\x99s aunt AnaÃ¯s Coviaux, a law student in Paris, who came to support her brother and    after Yanis was killed. â\\x80\\x9cThe children were playing among themselves, and they had their back to the road,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cThey did not hear the truck until just one second before it hit. It went up on the sidewalk it struck Yanis and the mother of one of the other children with them. â\\x80\\x9d The mother also died. There was no first aid nearby. Finally, Mr. Coviaux picked up his little boy and began walking with him until they found a person with a car who agreed to take them to the hospital. When they passed some firefighters, they stopped and asked them to try to revive him. But the child was dead. â\\x80\\x9cHe was my parentsâ\\x80\\x99 only grandson, the only grandson in the family,â\\x80\\x9d AnaÃ¯s Coviaux said softly. She explained that her brother and his wife were too distraught to speak. â\\x80\\x9cYanis loved people,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cHe especially liked Sundays when all the family was gathered, and he would say, â\\x80\\x98Mamie and Papi, we are going to have a party. â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Later, Mr. Coviaux said in an email that â\\x80\\x9cevery single person that Yanis met in his short life fell in love with him. â\\x80\\x9d The entire family gathered on the promenade Saturday to view the last sights he had seen. â\\x80\\x9cIt was important for us to come to the place he died to pay him a tribute,â\\x80\\x9d AnaÃ¯s Coviaux said, â\\x80\\x9cbecause we could not bear to say goodbye to him. We left a picture of him and flowers. â\\x80\\x9d Identifying children and examining them has been difficult because of the level of trauma and because some were brought to the hospital without relatives, said Sylvie Serret, a child psychiatrist at the Lenval Foundation hospital, which treated at least 30 injured children on Thursday night. â\\x80\\x9cA lot of the children coming in were in a state of shock they were not speaking, for instance,â\\x80\\x9d she said. An emergency room nurse at Pasteur Hospital, Mejdi Chemakhi, cared for several children, including a boy and a girl who had been brought in without their parents. The boy was 4, Mr. Chemakhi said, and the girl was 6. The boy, Mr. Chemakhi recounted, spoke in a flat tone, apparently in shock. â\\x80\\x9cMy mummy is dead, but my daddy is still alive,â\\x80\\x9d he recalled the boy saying over and over. The boy, expressionless, finally said, â\\x80\\x9cI am tired, I need to sleep, I have no clothes,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Chemakhi recalled. â\\x80\\x9cSo I took him in my arms and tried to console him,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t really know what else to do in those situations. It is really important to make them feel safe. â\\x80\\x9d Later that night, a wounded man was brought to the hospital and told Mr. Chemakhi that he had lost his wife and could not find his children, a boy and a girl. Mr. Chemakhi realized the three belonged together and helped reunite them. On the Promenade des Anglais on Saturday, there were memorials of flowers and notes, sometimes every few feet, to mark where people had lost their lives. Nathalie Russo, 30, a Muslim who wears a hijab, came with her mother to retrace the steps she and her children,    Mayssa and    Emine, took on Thursday night. â\\x80\\x9cMy daughter is telling me that she does not want to see fireworks again,â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Russo said, adding, â\\x80\\x9cShe kept asking me, â\\x80\\x98How did the bad people get from Paris to Nice? â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cShe thought the man who did this was one of those who attacked the Bataclan,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cand he had come here to do the same thing. â\\x80\\x9d The Bataclan is the Paris concert hall where 90 people were shot dead by three Islamic State operatives on Nov. 13, when a total of 130 people were killed in and around Paris by terrorists. Some mothers and fathers who had not been near the fireworks brought their children to see the memorials on Saturday as a way of expressing unity with the community and defiance toward the terrorists. Nour Hamila, a Nice native who has converted to Islam, made a point of bringing her three children, who are 8, 5 and 3. â\\x80\\x9cI told them not to be afraid because thatâ\\x80\\x99s what the terrorists want we have to support each other,â\\x80\\x9d she said as her    son, Mohamed, placed flowers on one of the memorials. It is harder for those children who witnessed the killings. For Ms. Kamelâ\\x80\\x99s    son, Haroun, the moment is etched in his mind. â\\x80\\x9cWe saw it from far away, a white truck in this black night,â\\x80\\x9d she said. She recalled thinking that the truck did not belong there because the street was closed to traffic. Her son and her friendâ\\x80\\x99s    son and    daughter were playing and laughing. Then the driver accelerated and began to veer from one side of the road to the other, â\\x80\\x9cplowing into people,â\\x80\\x9d she said. Somehow she pushed herself and her son onto the sidewalk as the truck neared. Then it passed, and all she remembers was her son saying, â\\x80\\x9cMama, Mama, you must come to help the people. â\\x80\\x9d She looked at the road and recognized a neighbor who was kneeling next to her husband, wailing his name. Ms. Kamel told her son to go with her friend and the other children. Everything was silent. â\\x80\\x9cThere was just this terrible wind,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cTo the left you saw bodies you looked right and saw bodies there were strollers, and people trying to save other people. â\\x80\\x9d After trying to comfort her neighbor, she looked for her son, but by then the crowds were running, and it was chaos. Hours later, when she found him and her friend, her son said, â\\x80\\x9cMama, did you manage to save the man?â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Kamel responded that the emergency services had come for him. â\\x80\\x9cYou know, children donâ\\x80\\x99t have a global vision,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cHe saw all those corpses, but for him, the one at his feet was supposed to be saved. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

       " 'â\\x80\\x9cNow, you\\'re right -- the Inspector General just came out with a report, it was not a good report for Secretary Clinton,â\\x80\\x9d Sanders told host John Dickerson, according to a transcript provided by the network. â\\x80\\x9cThat is something that the American people, Democrats and delegates, are going to have to take a hard look at.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTrailing Clinton among pledged delegates collected through state primaries and caucuses, Sanders said superdelegates -- party leaders and elected officials not formally bound to any candidate -- should, at the very least, cast their ballots at the Democratic National Convention in July with the candidate who carries a given state. \\n\\n \\n\\n That would give Sanders a boost from states like Vermont, Washington and Alaska, although Clinton prevailed in populous states such as New York, Florida and Texas. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sanders continued to press a case for superdelegates to switch their allegiance to him from Clinton, regardless of state affiliation, and said the e-mail controversy could become a drain on her in the general election.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey will be keeping it in mind. I donâ\\x80\\x99t have to tell them that,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI mean, everybody in America is keeping it in mind and the superdelegates sure are.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n \\n\\n Sanders trails Clinton by 1,769 to 1,499 in pledged delegates, according to an Associated Press count. When superdelegates are included Clinton\\'s lead swells to 2,310 to 1,542, leaving the former secretary of state 73 short of clinching the nomination. She\\'s likely to cross that mark when votes are tallied in New Jersey, one of six states to vote on June 7. \\n\\n \\n\\n Speaking on ABC\\'s \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos,\" Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said it was time for party unity. \"He ought to be able to read the sign posts as well as anybody else, and if he did that, he would know that it\\'s all but over,\" she said of Sanders. \\n\\n \\n\\n Still, Sanders insisted on CBS that \"there is just a possibility that we may end up at the end of this nominating process with more pledged delegates than Hillary Clinton.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think we have a good chance to win here,\" Sanders said of California, the most populous U.S. state. Two opinion polls last week offered different outcomes for California. One showed the race basically a toss-up, with Clinton ahead by 2 points. The other put the former New York senator up by 18 points. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Obviously if we don\\'t do well in California, it will make our path much, much harder,\" Sanders said in a separate interview on NBC\\'s \"Meet the Press.\" \"California is the big enchilada.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The State Departmentâ\\x80\\x99s inspector general found in a report made public on Wednesday that the e-mail set-up violated department rules, that Clinton never sought permission for it, and that the proposal would have been rejected if she had. The report handed Clinton\\'s Republican opponents a fresh line of attack - and Sanders, too, if he chose to take it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sanders won praise at a candidates\\' debate on October when he said, \"Enough of the e-mails. Let\\'s talk about the real issues facing America.\\'\\' At the time, his campaign used the comments in a fund-raising e-mail. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fast forward seven months and for Sanders, the delegates on offer on June 7 represent a last-ditch effort to close the gap with Clinton. \\n\\n \\n\\n A strong performance in California may boost Sanders\\'s case that superdelegates should switch their allegiance to him on the basis of perceived electability against Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. \\n\\n \\n\\n That argument so far has been driven by opinion polls showing Sanders faring better than Clinton in a hypothetical matchup with Trump. \\n\\n \\n\\n In another sign Sanders has taken off the gloves, his campaign late on Friday demanded the ouster of Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy and former Massachusetts Representative Barney Frank from a key platform committee at the Democratic National Convention. \\n\\n \\n\\n Democratic officials rejected Sanders\\'s request on Saturday, the Associated Press reported. \\n\\n \\n\\n In a statement the Sanders campaign said Frank and Malloy were \"aggressive attack surrogates\" for Clinton. Sanders\\'s lawyer said the pair canâ\\x80\\x99t work impartially â\\x80\\x9cwhile laboring under such deeply held bias.â\\x80\\x9d \\n\\n \\n\\n In a four-page letter hand-delivered to Democratic National Committee late Friday, Brad Deutsch, Sanders\\'s campaign counsel, wrote of animosity by Frank toward Sanders dating to 1991.\\n\\nCriticisms of Sanders by Frank and Malloy have gone beyond dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional, political and personal hostility toward the senator and his campaign, Deutsch said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Frank on Saturday pondered the Sanders campaign\\'s motive. \"I hope it is not to lay the basis for an inaccurate claim that he was unfairly denied the nomination, and I do see some elements of this,\" he told Politico.\\n\\nAlso this week, Sanders, keen for network airtime before the California vote, appeared to get a boost when presumptive Republican nominee Trump agreed to debate him to raise money for a charity. The billionaire businessman backed out on Friday, saying it would be â\\x80\\x9cinappropriateâ\\x80\\x9d to debate the second-place Democrat.\\n\\n \\n\\n Sanders may not have given up hope, though. \"Maybe we\\'ll get a call in five minutes and he\\'ll say yes again,\" he said on CBS.',\n",

       " 'PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron s government announced reforms to loosen labor regulations and drive down unemployment, drawing criticism from unions but limited support for the street protests that have hindered previous reform bids.  After weeks of negotiations with unions over the summer, the centrist government revealed measures including a cap on payouts for dismissals adjudged unfair and greater freedom to hire and fire. The plan would also give companies more flexibility to adapt pay and working hours to market conditions. The labor code reform is the first big test of Macron s drive to re-shape the euro zone s second biggest economy with its near double-digit jobless rate, double that in Britain and markedly higher than Germany. He also seeks a  grand bargain  with Germany over broader reforms of the euro zone. For decades, governments of the left and right have tried to reform France s strict labor rules, but have always diluted them in the face of street protests. The reform makes no direct reference to France s 35-hour week but gives employers more flexibility to negotiate deals with employees to work around it. Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud described the five decrees laying out the reforms as  a transformation of labor rules on an unprecedented scale . Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said they were necessary to fight France s stubbornly high unemployment.   The truth is that for bosses, especially of small companies, and foreign investors, the existing labor law is seen as a brake on hiring and investment,  Philippe said. Trade unions were less upbeat at what they perceived as the loss of long-cherished workers  rights.  All of our fears have been confirmed,  said Philippe Martinez, head of the hard-left CGT union, after the government presented the decrees to unions and employers. He said the union would press ahead with its plan for a protest on Sept. 12. But Macron s assiduous courting of the unions over the summer appeared to have born fruit. France s biggest union, the reformist CFDT, said it was disappointed with what amounted to a missed opportunity to improve labor relations. But both the CFDT and the smaller Force Ouvriere, one of the spearheads of last year s anti-reform protests, said they would not be joining the CGT s protest.   This reform does not rise to the occasion , CFDT leader Laurent Berger told reporters, but he added:  Taking to the streets is not the only mode of action for unions.  It sets a cap on compensation for a dismissal judged in a labor court to be unfair. This will be set at three months of wages for two years in the company with the amount rising progressively depending on how long a worker was with the firm. In a concession to unions, normal severance pay would be increased from 20 percent of one month s wage for each year in a company to 25 percent. Economists drew parallels with Germany and Spain.  This very much resembles the labor reform carried out in Germany in 2004-2005,  said Florian Hense, European economist at Berenberg Bank.  This could very well propel France to a golden decade like Germany had.   Dutch bank ING said:  The ceiling on dismissal compensation is a milestone in labor flexibility and a real positive for permanent contract creation. In Spain, a similar reform kick-started an unprecedented labor market recovery.   Pierre Gattaz, the head of the MEDEF employers federation, described the reforms as an important first step which would boost confidence within companies. The CPME, a small business lobby, was even more positive.  At last!,  it said in a statement.  After months of negotiations, we got results. The reform we had been waiting for so long is there.  The labor reforms comes as the 39-year-old president suffers a steep drop in popularity ratings. Early policy announcements including an overhaul of the wealth tax and cuts to housing assistance have left a swathe of voters feeling his policies favor the rich, pollsters say. The government plans to start talks on overhauling unemployment benefits in October before tackling pension reform next year.  Parliament, where Macron s Republic on the Move party has a commanding majority, has already voted to allow the government to issue the decrees without a vote in the assembly. The government plans to adopt the decrees on Sept. 22.    ',\n",

       " 'Department of Homeland Security Inspector General John Roth, an Obama appointee, is treating the February 24 leak of a draft DHS document central to the separate decisions by two federal judges revoking President Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s travel ban on March 15 differently than he did the April 2, 2015 unauthorized leak of private information about Rep. Jason Chaffetz from the employment files of the Secret Service. One day after the Chaffetz leak, DHS announced an OIG investigation. More than one month after the leak of the draft DHS document, published in a February 24 Associated Press story written by Vivian Salama and Alice C. Caldwell, DHS is silent as to whether an investigation has been or will be launched. On April 2, 2015, the Daily Beast reported that â\\x80\\x9cHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who oversees the Secret Service, never disclosed that he had applied for and was rejected from the agency in the early 2000s,â\\x80\\x9d in an article written by reporter Tim Mak. Mak did not disclose in the article how he first learned of Chaffetzâ\\x80\\x99s application to the Secret Service, which has been a part of the Department of Homeland Security since 2003. One day later, on April 3, 2015 CNN reported, â\\x80\\x9cSenior staff from the House committee that oversees the Secret Service have asked the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General to look into allegations that U. S. Secret Service employees circulated private personnel information about committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cChaffetzâ\\x80\\x99s office confirmed that the House Oversight Committee chairman applied unsuccessfully to a job with the Secret Service in 2003,â\\x80\\x9d CNN reported, adding: The Secret Service referred CNN to the investigation being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General as to whether any policies were violated. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson apologized to Chaffetz in a phone call Thursday night for the congressman â\\x80\\x9cbeing put in the situation that he had to acknowledge a matter that should have been kept confidential,â\\x80\\x9d according to DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron. Johnson also called for an investigation into the matter, Catron said. â\\x80\\x9cWe conducted this investigation from April 2, 2015 to August 21, 2015,â\\x80\\x9d the final report, â\\x80\\x9cInvestigation into the Improper Access and Distribution of Information Contained Within a Secret Service Data System,â\\x80\\x9d made public on September 25, 2015 by DHS Inspector General John Roth â\\x80\\x94  an Obama appointee who has held over into the Trump administration â\\x80\\x94  noted. DHS Inspector General Rothâ\\x80\\x99s quick pursuit of an investigation into the unauthorized leak of Congressman Chaffetzâ\\x80\\x99s employment application to the Secret Service stands in stark contrast to his silence, and the departmentâ\\x80\\x99s silence, on its reaction to the unauthorized leak of a draft DHS document, published in a February 24 AP story written by Vivian Salama and Alice C. Caldwell, that was cited as key evidence in the separate decisions by two federal judges on March 15 to revoke President Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s travel ban. â\\x80\\x9cAs a matter of policy, DHS neither confirms nor denies the potential existence of ongoing investigations,â\\x80\\x9d DHS spokesperson Gillian Christensen tells Breitbart News.  While that silence on â\\x80\\x9cthe potential existence of ongoing investigationsâ\\x80\\x9d may be the current policy, it was apparently not the departmentâ\\x80\\x99s policy on April 3, 2015 when a spokesperson for the Secret Service confirmed the existence of a DHS OIG investigation into the Secret Service leak about Rep. Chaffetz. Nor does that policy appear to apply to a recent highly publicized DHS OIG investigation related to the implementation of President Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Executive Order 13769 â\\x80\\x94  the initial temporary travel bans for citizens of seven Middle Eastern countries â\\x80\\x94  Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Libya, and Iraq (the only one of the seven countries not included in the subsequent Executive Order 13780). On February 1, four days after President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, â\\x80\\x9cThe Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (DHS OIG) announced that it will review DHSâ\\x80\\x99 implementation of the recent Executive Order,â\\x80\\x9cProtecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States. â\\x80\\x9d The review is being initiated in response to congressional request and whistleblower and hotline complaints: In addition to reviewing the implementation of the Executive Order, the OIG will review DHSâ\\x80\\x99 adherence to court orders and allegations of individual misconduct on the part of DHS personnel. If circumstances warrant, the OIG will consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review. The leaked draft DHS document published in the February 24 AP story was three pages in total, and had no letterhead nor any other markings to indicate it originated in the DHS, nor did it bear the name or signature of any current DHS employee. The authors of the story, however, asserted that it originated within the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, an assertion not disputed by a spokesperson for DHS, who did note, however, that it was an â\\x80\\x9cincompleteâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cdraftâ\\x80\\x9d document and not an authorized official position of DHS. The leaked document did however, cite another DHS document in an end note as the source of the data described within it, â\\x80\\x9d DHS IA   Activities Study: 16 FEB 17 DOI 01 Mar 11  â\\x80\\x94   31 Jan 17 DHS IA   Activities Study. â\\x80\\x9d Breitbart News asked DHS to obtain a copy of this document, as well as a description of its classification status, but did not receive a response to that request. Information about the classification status of that cited document may play a key role in determining the potential level of criminality involved in the leaking of the draft document. If, for instance, it is a classified document, federal laws have clearly been broken. If it is â\\x80\\x9cclassified but sensitive,â\\x80\\x9d federal laws have likely been broken. If it is completely unclassified, prosecutors would have a more difficult time proving violation of federal laws, but the leak would certainly be cause for termination at DHS. â\\x80\\x9cGenerally speaking, DHS employees are held to the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct. Any allegations of misconduct are taken seriously and addressed appropriately,â\\x80\\x9d Christensen adds. In the case of the unauthorized leak of Rep. Chaffetzâ\\x80\\x99s employment application, those allegations were addressed more than a year later, on May 27, 2016, when Homeland Security Security Jeh Johnson announced, â\\x80\\x9cThe U. S. Secret Service has punished 41 employees in the improper access and leak of House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetzâ\\x80\\x99s personnel files during his committeeâ\\x80\\x99s investigation of the beleaguered agency,â\\x80\\x9d as Law 360 reported. Johnsonâ\\x80\\x99s statement from the U. S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Secret Service, referenced a September DHS Office of Inspector General report that found records from the Utah Republicanâ\\x80\\x99s 2003 application with the agency were accessed around 60 times. From there the decision was one of accountability, Johnson said, with the conduct of 57 Secret Service staff reviewed, and 41 of those being punished. â\\x80\\x9cThis discipline includes a letter of reprimand to one individual, suspended discipline contingent on no further misconduct for a period of five years, and suspensions from duty without pay for periods of up to 45 days,â\\x80\\x9d Johnson said. â\\x80\\x9cThe one individual found by the Inspector General to have disclosed the private information to an outside source, the Washington Post, has resigned from the Secret Service. I found no basis to take any action with respect to the Director or Deputy Director. â\\x80\\x9d The apparent lack of curiosity displayed by the DHS Inspector General as to the origins of the leaked draft DHS document that played such a central role in the constitutionally significant decisions made separately by Judge Derrick Watson of the U. S. District Court of Hawaii and Judge Theodore Chuang of the U. S. District Court of Maryland on March 15, revoking President Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s Executive Order 13780, raises further questions about the conduct of the federal bureaucrats in the new Trump administration. â\\x80\\x9cDemocrats own the Deep State, that network of embedded bureaucrats, academics and media, judicial activists, and spooks that is operating to stymie, discredit, and ultimately remove from office a president that is a threat to their mutual agenda. They are agreed that government should control more of lifeâ\\x80\\x99s essential functions, and that benign rule of the enlightened can reshape society to match their visions,â\\x80\\x9d Thomas Lifson writes at American Thinker about this leak. â\\x80\\x9cThe draft report [leaked to the Associated Press and published on February 24] came from DHSâ\\x80\\x99s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, which was headed by David Grannis, an Obama holdover bureaucrat. Grannis is a partisan Democrat who previously worked as a staffer for Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Jane Harman. A DHS spokesman â\\x80\\x9cwould neither confirm nor deny that Grannis was the author of, or had reviewed, the leaked document  â\\x80¦    . â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9d John Hinderaker writes at Powerline Blog: How about the reporters? It pretty much goes without saying that AP reporters are Democrats. But Leahy also points out [in a March 27 article at Breitbart] that Vivian Salama formerly worked for Rolling Stone, where she wrote that Yemen â\\x80\\x94  one of the countries covered by the travel order â\\x80\\x94  â\\x80\\x9cholds a special place in my heart. â\\x80\\x9d She has bitterly denounced U. S. drone strikes in Yemen. So it appears that what happened here is that Democratic Party activists in the Department of Homeland Security either created a bogus document or dug up a   draft document that had never been issued, and fed it to Democratic Party activists at the Associated Press. The Democratic Party activists at the AP published a story based on the anonymous document, which two Democratic Party activists on the bench used as a pretext for orders enjoining the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s travel order. Those orders should be viewed as purely political acts that have no basis in any valid judicial reasoning or authority. â\\x80\\x9cI suspect that we will see many more examples of the Deep State in action because we are getting more aware of them, as they are getting more desperate, careless, and  . Naming it, defining it, and documenting it are important aspects of the fight against it. The Deep State does not like the light for good reasons,â\\x80\\x9d American Thinkerâ\\x80\\x99s Lifson concludes. DHS Inspector General Rothâ\\x80\\x99s conduct of the officeâ\\x80\\x99s earlier investigation into the Secret Service leak was questioned in a September 28, 2015 Washington Post article written by Jerry Markon. â\\x80\\x9cJohn Roth is the top watchdog at the Department of Homeland Security, a position shielded by law from outside pressure so he can conduct independent inquiries of the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s sensitive internal workings,â\\x80\\x9d the Post reported. But during a nearly completed investigation of the Secret Service, Rothâ\\x80\\x99s office has taken the unorthodox step of allowing officials from the service to work alongside his agents as they tried to determine how unflattering information about a congressman was disclosed from the agencyâ\\x80\\x99s files, according to half a dozen people familiar with the inquiry. Legal experts and former government investigators said the approach threatens the integrity of the investigation of who at the Secret Service uncovered and leaked material showing that Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( )  â\\x80\\x94   chairman of a House committee overseeing the agency  â\\x80\\x94   had once been rejected for a job as an agent. Chaffetz has been an outspoken critic of the Secret Service, which has been rocked recently by   security breaches. Secret Service staff members  â\\x80\\x94   inspectors from the agencyâ\\x80\\x99s internal affairs office who examine possible misconduct among employees  â\\x80\\x94   sat in on interviews with some of the more than 40 agents and officers questioned about the unauthorized disclosures, the people said. In some cases, the Secret Service inspectors contacted witnesses directly and questioned them along with investigators from the DHS Inspector Generalâ\\x80\\x99s Office headed by Roth, who is responsible for examining alleged wrongdoing across the breadth of Homeland Security. â\\x80\\x9cIn one instance, Rothâ\\x80\\x99s agents and Secret Service inspectors jointly questioned an agent about Carol D. Leonnig, a reporter for The Washington Post who has uncovered security missteps by the service, according to the agentâ\\x80\\x99s attorney. Investigators asked about stories related to Chaffetz and other subjects and confronted the agent with his personal cellphone records, showing alleged calls and texts with Leonnig, the lawyer said,â\\x80\\x9d the Post noted: The serviceâ\\x80\\x99s involvement in investigating itself is problematic, experts say, because top officials at the agency had an incentive to embarrass Chaffetz. The participation of the serviceâ\\x80\\x99s inspectors also could deter internal whistleblowers from coming forward with additional allegations of misconduct for fear of retribution by their bosses, the experts said. You just donâ\\x80\\x99t do it. You donâ\\x80\\x99t have the agency youâ\\x80\\x99re investigating involved in the investigation,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 said Eric Feldman, who held   posts in inspector generalâ\\x80\\x99s offices at four federal agencies in Democratic and Republican administrations and now advises companies on ethics. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s why you have an independent inspector general: to avoid the potential for conflict. â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 The agentâ\\x80\\x99s cellphone records were obtained through an administrative subpoena issued by the DHS inspector general, people familiar with the probe said. Such subpoenas are a device that lawyers and former government officials say federal agencies increasingly use to force people and companies to turn over personal records and other documents without the prior approval of a judge. Breitbart News asked Department of Justice if it intended to launch its own investigation into the leak of the draft DHS document, but has not received a response. â\\x80\\x9cThere are laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of classified materials and a process by which agencies can report unauthorized disclosures to the Department of Justice,â\\x80\\x9d the FBI spokesperson tells Breitbart News. â\\x80\\x9cYou should direct your questions to DHS to determine whether such a disclosure has occurred. Typically, documents would contain portion markings indicating classification,â\\x80\\x9d the spokesperson said. â\\x80\\x9cEthics or policy violations would also be reviewed by the appropriate office within DHS, not the FBI,â\\x80\\x9d the spokesperson added.',\n",
       " 'With mainstream media and establishment politicians stacked against him from the moment he announced his run for the presidency, Donald J. Trump has been in an ongoing pitched battle to communicate his plans   and his eventual successes   to Americans. Through public rallies and social media, he has managed to bypass the traditional information gatekeepers and has spoken directly to the people.Yet, Americans are subjected to a relentless drumbeat from the Democratic Party, amplified by virtually the entire establishment press, that Trump is not only undisciplined, unfit for office and possibly racist, but that embarrassingly little has been accomplished by the Trump administration.But we  Deplorables  know better When Dana Kamide made this pro-Trump video last year, it was an instant hit. The hilarious video reminded Americans of why we re so blessed to have President Trump as our President. To date, the  It s The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year  viral video has been seen over 5.6 million times. This Christmas, let s all count our blessings and remember to be thankful for the bullet we dodged in 2016.    Enjoy WND   And while he has befuddled and disappointed some   with major promises such as Obamacare repeal and a border wall unfulfilled or put on the backburner   the stunning reality is this: Donald Trump has amassed a long and remarkable list of actions and accomplishments that will surprise average Americans, even those who support the president and consider themselves well-informed politically.Below, is an accounting of the truly significant achievements of the first eight months of the Trump presidency. The accomplishments are all the more noteworthy as they have been carried out in an environment of unrelenting negativity on the part of not only the Democrats and almost the entire news media, but the Beltway establishment itself, the entire donor class, the  Deep State,  and even many Republicans wedded to the D.C.  swamp. DECEMBERRegulatory reform: President Trump announced Dec. 14 his administration has far exceeded its promise to eliminate regulations at a 2:1 ratio and impose no lifetime net regulatory costs. In total, agencies issued 67 deregulatory actions while imposing only three new regulatory actions, a ratio of 22:1. Federal agencies also achieved $8.1 billion in lifetime net regulatory cost savings, the equivalent of $570 million per year. Jobs: Some 228,000 new jobs were created in November, highlighting the strongest U.S. labor market since the turn of the century. The government also reported Dec. 8 that unemployment was unchanged at 4.1 percent, but that s still nearly a 17-year low. Military: The Trump administration asked a federal court Dec. 7 for an emergency stay to delay a court order to begin opening the military to transgender recruits by Jan. 1. Israel: While the previous three U.S. presidents promised during their election campaigns to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, President Trump on Dec. 6 became the first to follow through. In his official order, Trump also ordered the U.S. Embassy to be moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded:  President Donald Trump, thank you for today s historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. The Jewish people and the Jewish state will be forever grateful.  Immigration: The Department of Homeland Security released figures Dec. 4 showing Trump is delivering on his pledge to more strictly control immigration and deter would-be border-crossers. Border Patrol arrests dropped to a 45-year low in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, down 25 percent from a year earlier. ICE said the number of people apprehended away from the border jumped 25 percent this fiscal year. The increase is 37 percent after Trump s inauguration compared to the same period the year before. States  rights: President Trump signed two executive orders Dec. 4 that gave back about 2 million acres of land to the state of Utah by modifying executive orders by President Obama. Arguing the Antiquities Act  requires that any reservation of land as part of a monument be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects of historic or scientific interest to be protected,  Trump reduced the federal government s control of the Bear s Ear National Monument to just 201,876 acres, pointing out that the important objects of scientific or historic interest described described in Obama s proclamation are protected under existing laws and agency management designations. He also reduced the Grand Staircase National Monument in Utah from nearly 1.9 million acres to about 1 million. Immigration: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced Dec. 3 the Trump administration is withdrawing from the Global Compact on Migration, arguing the pact would  undermine the sovereign right of the United States to enforce our immigration laws and secure our borders.  Tillerson made the announcement just before the opening of a global conference on migration in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Tax reform: Propelled by the engagement of President Trump, the Senate on Dec. 1 passed the biggest rewrite of the nation s tax system since 1986, reducing rates for businesses and individuals. The Republican-led House passed a similar bill in November. The two chambers of Congress will negotiate a reconciliation of the two bills that they expect to put on the president s desk before the end of the year. Health care: The Senate tax-reform bill passed Dec. 1 eliminates Obamacare s individual mandate, the linchpin of Obama s government-controlled health-care system, which penalizes taxpayers for choosing not to buy health insurance.NOVEMBERStocks: The Dow Jones industrial average surged more than 331 points Nov. 30 to close above 24,000 for the first time in history. Stocks were buoyed by the possibility of the Senate passing the Republican tax-reform bill championed by President Trump. Mining: Mining increased 28.6 percent in the second quarter and was the leading contributor to growth for the nation and in the three fastest-growing states of North Dakota, Wyoming, and Texas, according to the Commerce Department s Bureau of Economic Analysis. North Korea: In response to North Korea s buildup of nuclear weapons and missiles, the communist nation was officially designated a state sponsor of terror by the Trump administration on Nov. 20. The Treasury Department followed up with sanctions on organizations and companies doing business with North Korea. Regulation reform: Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Nov. 17 the Department of Justice will cease the practice initiated by President Obama of issuing  guidance memos  to enact new regulations that sometimes have had the effect of changing federal laws. Iran: Trump issued a memorandum Nov. 16 determining that the U.S. has enough petroleum coming from countries other than Iran to permit  a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products  purchased from the mullah-led nation. China trade: During President Trump s visit to China in November, trade and investment deals worth more than $250 billion were announced that are expected to create jobs for American workers, farmers and ranchers by increasing U.S. exports to China and stimulating investment in American communities. Government transparency: The federal government on Nov. 9 made public more than 13,000 additional documents from its files on President John F. Kennedy s assassination, under orders from President Trump. It was the fourth released since October, when the president allowed the immediate release of 2,800 records by the National Archives. International liberty: President Trump proclaimed Nov. 7, the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, as the National Day for the Victims of Communism Religious liberty: The Department of Agriculture issued a guidance Nov. 6 that ensures Christians who opposed same-sex marriage would not be discriminated against for their beliefs. Job growth: President Trump announced in the Oval Office Nov. 2 that the semiconductor manufacturing company Broadcom Limited is moving its headquarters from Singapore to the United States. Broadcom is a Fortune 100 company that already employs more than 7,500 workers in the United States, and that number is expected to grow exponentially, with an estimated $20 billion to be spent on employees annually. Broadcom CEO Hock E. Tan said the decision to relocate Broadcom was driven by  his desire to give back to this country that has given me so much.  Government reform: EPA Director Scott Pruitt placed 66 new experts on three different EPA scientific committees who espouse more conservative views than their predecessors. To prevent conflicts of interest, Pruitt signed a directive Oct. 31 banning scientists who receive EPA grants from serving on the agency s independent advisory boards.OCTOBERJob growth: The White House announced Oct. 25 a new drone Integration Pilot Program that will accelerate drone integration into the national airspace system. Under the program, the Department of Transportation will enter into agreements with state, local, and tribal governments to establish innovation zones for testing complex UAS operations and to attempt different models for integrating drones into local airspace. Calling drones  a critical, fast-growing part of American aviation, increasing efficiency, productivity, and jobs, the White House said they  present opportunities to enhance the safety of the American public, increase the efficiency and productivity of American industry, and create tens of thousands of new American jobs.  Government reform: Melania Trump, while embracing a more active and public schedule as first lady, is running one of the leanest East Wing operations in recent history, according to a Fox News analysis of White House personnel reports that found she has significantly reduced the number of aides on the first lady s office payroll in comparison to her predecessor, Michelle Obama. During President Obama s first year in office, 16 people were listed working for Michelle Obama, earning a combined $1.24 million a year. This year, just four people were listed working for Melania Trump as of June, with salaries totaling $486,700. Obamacare: Trump signed an executive order Oct. 12 that directs three federal agencies to rewrite regulations to encourage the establishment of cheaper health plans that can be purchased across state lines and are not bound by certain Obamacare rules and regulations. The directive would allow small-business owners, trade groups and others to join together to purchase health insurance. The plans would not be required to include benefits such as prescription drugs. Trump also wants to expand the sale of stopgap policies that don t cover pre-existing conditions, mental health services and other costly benefits. Consumer optimism: U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly surged to a 13-year high as Americans  perceptions of the economy and their own finances rebounded following several major hurricanes, a University of Michigan survey showed Oct. 13. Iran nuclear agreement: President Trump announced Oct. 13 he will not certify the Iran nuclear deal and vowed that the U.S. would pull out unless changes are made. He also unveiled a new strategy, the culmination of nine months of deliberation with Congress and allies, on how to best protect American security from the rogue mullah-led regime. The plan includes denying the regime funding and any paths to a nuclear weapon and ballistic missiles. The Department of the Treasury sanctioned more than 25 entities and individuals involved in Iran s ballistic missile program. The U.S. also sanctioned 16 entities and individuals that have supported Iran s military and Revolutionary Guard Corps in the development of drones, fast attack boats and other military equipment. United Nations: The United States is quitting the United Nations  Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, announced the move will be made before the end of the year  This decision was not taken lightly, and reflects U.S. concerns with mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO.  Homeland security: The Supreme Court dismissed a major challenge to President Trump s travel ban on majority-Muslim countries Oct. 10 because it has been replaced by a new version, sending the controversy back to the starting block. The ruling is a victory for the Trump administration, which had asked the court to drop the case after Trump signed a proclamation Sept. 24 that replaced the temporary travel ban on six nations with a new, indefinite ban affecting eight countries. That action made the court challenge moot, the justices ruled. EPA reform: Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt announced Oct. 9 a new set of rules that will override the Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of President Barack Obama s drive to curb global climate change. The agency is moving to undo, delay or block more than 30 environmental rules, the largest regulatory rollback in the agency s 47-year history. Immigration: The Trump administration submitted to Congress Oct. 8 a 70-point proposal that calls for increased border security, interior enforcement of immigration laws and a merit-based immigration system. It includes funding and completing construction of a southern border wall, improving expedited removal of illegal aliens, protecting innocent people in  sanctuary cities,  ending extended-family chain migration and establishing a point-based system for green cards to protect U.S. workers and taxpayers. Religious liberty: Attorney General Sessions on Oct. 6 issued guidance to all administrative agencies and executive departments regarding religious liberty protections in federal law in keeping with Trump s May 4 executive order. The guidance interprets existing protections for religious liberty in federal law, identifying 20 high-level principles that administrative agencies and executive departments can put to practical use to ensure the religious freedoms of Americans are lawfully protected. Attorney General Sessions also issued a second memorandum to the Department of Justice, directing implementation of the religious liberty guidance within the department. Among the principles are  the freedom of religion extends to persons and organizations,   Americans do not give up their freedom of religion by participating in the marketplace, partaking of the public square, or interacting with government  and government  may not restrict acts or abstentions because of the beliefs they display.  Missile defense: The Department of Defense reprogrammed approximately $400 million for U.S. missile defense systems. Religious liberty: The Trump administration expanded religious and moral exemptions for mandated contraceptive coverage under Obamacare. Obama s signature legislation required that nearly all insurance plans cover abortion-inducing drugs and contraception, forcing citizens to violate sincerely held religious or moral beliefs, pay steep fines, or forgo offering or obtaining health insurance entirely. The interim final rules note that the United States  has a long history of providing conscience protections in the regulation of health care entities and individuals with objections based on religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The rule aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court s unanimous ruling protecting the Little Sisters of the Poor, which says the government cannot fine religious groups for following their faith. Immigration: Amid strong Democratic opposition, the House Homeland Security Committee gave first approval to the broad scope of President Trump s border wall Oct. 4, clearing a bill that would authorize $10 billion in new infrastructure spending, new waivers to speed up construction, and 10,000 more border agents and officers to patrol the U.S.-Mexico line. Space exploration: President Trump revived the National Space Council for the first time in 25 years to assist him in developing and implementing long-range strategic goals for the nation s space policy. The pace program will refocus on human exploration and discovery. Vice President Mike Pence, who chaired the National Space Council s Oct. 5 meeting, said the administration aims to establish a renewed American presence on the moon and from that foundation become the first nation to bring mankind to Mars. The administration also will renew America s commitment to creating the space technology needed to protect national security. And Pence pointed out the intelligence community reports that Russia and China are pursuing a full range of anti-satellite technology designed to threaten our U.S. military effectiveness. Abortion: The Office of Management and Budget on Oct. 2 issued a Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) to strongly support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36), which would generally make it unlawful for any person to perform, or attempt to perform, an abortion of an unborn child after 20 weeks post-fertilization. Protecting life: The president issued a statement Oct. 1 renewing the nation s  strong commitment to promoting the health, well-being, and inherent dignity of all children and adults with Down syndrome.  The president observed  there remain too many people   both in the United States and throughout the world   that still see Down syndrome as an excuse to ignore or discard human life.  He said Americans and their government  must always be vigilant in defending and promoting the unique and special gifts of all citizens in need  and  should not tolerate any discrimination against them, as all people have inherent dignity.  Protecting life: The Department of Health and Human Services has published a draft of a new strategic plan that states in its introduction that life begins at conception. The personhood of the unborn child is central to the abortion debate   as even the justice who wrote the landmark Roe v. Wade opinion has acknowledged   because, if established in law, it would nullify a  right  to abortion. The largely overlooked HHS strategic plan for 2018-22 states the agency  accomplishes its mission through programs and initiatives that cover a wide spectrum of activities, serving and protecting Americans at every stage of life, beginning at conception.  Tax reform: Trump is working with Congress to lower taxes by seven points for the middle class and lower business taxes to a 15 percent rate.SEPTEMBERLower courts: Trump is filling up lower courts with lifetime appointees. In the estimation of Democratic official Ron Klain, a  massive transformation is underway in how our fundamental rights are defined by the federal judiciary.  Klain, lamenting Trump s moves, said the president  is proving wildly successful in one respect: naming youthful conservative nominees to the federal bench in record-setting numbers.  On Sept. 28, Trump announced an eighth wave of judicial candidates, with nine more names. Canada trade: In September, the Commerce Department, siding with Boeing, slapped a 219 percent tariff on the import of Canadian-made Bombardier jets, arguing they are supported by subsidies from the governments of Canada and the U.K., creating an unfair market. Korea trade: Trump began the process of renegotiating the United States-South Korea Free Trade Agreement in September. Climate: In September, Trump shut down a climate-change advisory panel under the direction of NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, that critics have contended was formed largely to promote President Obama s climate policies, arguing it lacked representation from  those who think the empirical evidence points to human actions contributing little to global warming and that attempting to reduce it would slow the conquest of poverty around the world.  The EPA also has decided not to renew the appointments of dozens of scientists on various scientific advisory panels. Economy: Household wealth reached a record high of $1.7 trillion in the second quarter due to rising property values and gains in financial assets, according to a Federal Reserve report. Homeland security: In September, Trump signed an executive order to enhance vetting capabilities and processes for detecting attempted entry into the United States by terrorists or other public-security threats. North Korea: After some 25 years of failed negotiations to contain Pyongyang s nuclear program, the communist regime s latest threatening actions were met by President Trump with a warning that military action, including a preemptive nuclear attack, would be considered. After Trump s warnings, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un backed off on his threat to attack the U.S. territory of Guam. North Korea: On Sept. 7, the U.S. fully deployed the THAAD missile defense system to South Korea despite objections from Pyongyang s chief ally, China. North Korea: In September, Trump signed an executive order significantly expanding U.S. authority to target individuals, companies and financial institutions that finance and facilitate trade with North Korea, most of which are Chinese. Meanwhile, China s central bank has ordered banks in its massive banking system to immediately stop doing business with North Korea. United Nations: In his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Trump told the global body in September,  I put America first and you should do the same with your nations.  In the speech, he also explicitly denounced socialism and communism, pointing to Venezuela as an example of what happens when socialism is successfully implemented. Immigration: President Trump, in September, rescinded Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals order, which gave de facto amnesty to some 800,000 people who came to the country as children with their illegal-alien parents. Trump delayed implementing his order for six months to give Congress time to come up with a legislative solution. Stock markets: Through the first week of September, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had 34 record highs. From Election Day to the Inauguration, the Dow rose more than 1,500 points. It climbed another 2,500 points from Inauguration Day, reaching more than 22,400 in mid-September, a gain of more than $4 trillion in wealth since Trump was elected. The Dow s spike from 19,000 to above 21,000 in just 66 days was the fastest 2,000-point rise ever. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ also have set all-time highs. On Aug. 7, the Dow closed with an all-time high for the ninth day in a row, the first time the market has had a run of that length twice under one presidency.For the entire list, go to WND ',\n",

       " 'A large group of very diverse young adults who call themselves  The Modern Patriots videotaped themselves being kicked out of the  Grill On The Hill  bar located at Amsterdam Ave. and W. 140th St in Harlem for wearing Trump hats. 100 Percent FED UP spoke with one of the young adults who was part of the group to find out why they were kicked out. According to the young lady we spoke with, The Modern Patriots group had just finished giving a speech at the City College across the street and decided to go out together to have a drink. They looked for the nearest bar, and happened to end up across the street at the  Grill On The Hill . There were 15 people in their group; 3 females and 12 males. Some of the males had MAGA (Make America Great Again) hats on. When they entered the bar, a young woman began screaming that she was offended by their MAGA hats. Other customers in the bar joined in and started jeering at them. It was then that they were told to leave.The groups who call themselves  The Modern Patriots  can be seen in the video below chanting,  USA, USA  as they were being kicked out of the bar. A large black man in a blue shirt followed them out of the bar and approached them. He warned them as they were leaving,  It s a very sensitive time. Be careful with that.  The young patriots appeared frustrated with the treatment they received from the bar, but responded in a very respectful manner. The man wearing the blue shirt in the video asked,  Do you know where you re at?  to which one of the students who was kicked out of the bar responded, Yeah, America! We talked to one of the young female Trump supporters who was with the group when they were kicked out. She explained how the customer in the bar who was triggered by their hats followed the bouncer outside the bar, engaging them in a shouting match. The bouncer was admonishing the young adults wearing MAGA hats, while attempting to move them off the public sidewalk, when the female customer who started the issue inside the bar stepped outside and began taunting the Trump supporters. The female patriot who was part of the group explained to us what happened once they we re forced outside:  I told him [the bouncer] we have our own opinion and he responded that the people in the bar had their opinion too. That woman was screaming at our friend and he gave her the middle finger when we were already outside of the bar but she started everything like she owns the place. She started all of this and when the bouncer came outside she did as well and added fuel to fire. But the bouncer was agreeing with them and told us to relax. We did not go there to cause problems we wear our maga hats all over NYC and we rarely have issues. We felt discriminated by this bar and even now they re trying to justify why they kicked us out on their page. Most of the people we were with attend the college nearby and live in the neighborhood but they are basically telling us we don t belong here. I m not for the identity politics no matter where we go we find supporters so they can keep their segregated bar and we will keep on protecting free speech. The man in the blue shirt continues to warn the young adults who dared to wear their Trump hats into the bar,  Be careful out there. It ain t no joke. It ain t no meme. Be careful out there.  He continue to threaten them,  We don t play that shit here.  He tells them to  take that shit where you live.  to which one of the Trump supports says,  I live here!  His response is priceless:  I don t give a f**k where you live. Is the man in the blue shirt suggesting this crowd of young adults who represent just about every racial group in America, had no business being in a bar whose customer base is primarily black? What about the college across the street? Do they only allow black students to drink at their bar?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa1m2N3W5tE&feature=shareThe best line in the video comes near the end of the confrontation when the man in the blue shirt says,  This ain t a democracy. Be careful with yourselves.  At which point the young patriots begin to laugh and walk away to avoid confrontation as they chant, He will not divide us! Here is a sample of some of the responses Grill On The Hill received under their post on their Facebook page, where they tried to explain why they kicked the large group of young adults supporting our President out of their bar: The popular online restaurant review service Yelp shut down the comments section on the  Grill On The Hill  after they were overwhelmed by  reviews  after the story began to circulate on social media:We took screen shots of a few of the reviews that were mostly hidden from users of the YELP review service.The first reviewer starts out by mocking the man in the blue shirt saying:  Be careful with that.  They told people who are low on melanin to go back to downtown. Racists.The second reviewer claimed YELP would not allow her to give  Grill On The Hill  ZERO stars.  She went on to say,  Anyone who lets a person political opinion interfere with them tryout to enjoy a night out is bull. You say free speech but kick people out for wearing trump hats. Shame on you. That s talking out of both sides of your mouth. Stay away. Far away. We called Grill On The Hill to speak with the owners to get their side of the story. The owners were unavailable.',\n",

Nashville Police have identified the suspect of a mass shooting at a church Sunday morning as 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson.Samson is being charged with murder and multiple counts of attempted murder in the attack that killed one and left at least seven other people injured at the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, a town just south of Nashville, Tenn.IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE: One brave church member, 22-year-old Caleb Engle, confronted the Samson before being pistol whipped in the face. Engle then went to his car to retrieve a gun, which he has under a concealed carry license (CCL). Engle returned to the church to confront the gunman again. The gunman shot himself in the face when the man returned, possibly by accident. He s the hero here,  Nashville police chief Steve Anderson said.  He s the person who stopped this madness in its tracks. Later today, Engle released a statement: Samson is a bodybuilder who attended high school in Tennessee and is originally from Karthoum, Sudan, according screenshots of the suspect s Facebook page. Emanuel K. Samson came from Sudan in 1996. He was a legal US resident but not necessarily a US citizen.A Nashville Police Department spokesman said the shooter entered the church after 11 a.m. CST wearing a neoprene ski mask.

       " 'Climate change is never going to announce itself by name. But this is what we should expect it to look like. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what many scientists, analysts and activists are saying after heavy rains in southern Louisiana have killed at least 11 people and forced tens of thousands of residents from their homes, in the latest in a series of extreme floods that have occurred in the United States over the last two years. That increase in heavy rainfall and the resultant flooding â\\x80\\x9cis consistent with what we expect to see in the future if you look at climate models,â\\x80\\x9d said David Easterling, a director at the National Centers for Environmental Information, which is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. â\\x80\\x9cNot just in the U. S. but in many other parts of the world as well. â\\x80\\x9d The flooding in Louisiana is the eighth event since May of last year in which the amount of rainfall in an area in a specified window of time matches or exceeds the NOAA predictions for an amount of precipitation that will occur once every five hundred years, or has a 0. 2 percent chance of occurring in any given year. Louisiana joins five other states, most of them in the South, that have experienced deadly flooding in the last 15 months, including Oklahoma, Texas, South Carolina and West Virginia. In the last three months alone, floods in Maryland, West Virginia and Louisiana have combined to kill dozens of people and damage tens of thousands of homes and vehicles. The National Weather Service reports that parts of Louisiana have received as much as 31 inches of rain in the last week, a number Dr. Easterling called â\\x80\\x9cpretty staggering,â\\x80\\x9d and one that exceeds an amount of precipitation that his center predicts will occur once every thousand years in the area. Dr. Easterling said that those sorts of estimates were predicated on the idea that the climate was stable, a principle that has become outdated. The third National Climate Assessment, released in 2014 by the United States Global Change Research Program, showed that â\\x80\\x9cthe amount of rain falling in very heavy precipitation eventsâ\\x80\\x9d had been significantly above average since 1991. However, the research did not identify the South as one of the areas of greatest concern the increase was found to be greatest in the Northeast, Midwest and Upper Great Plains regions of the United States. Some climate researchers warned Tuesday that it was too early to explain why so much of the country has faced sudden flooding. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s really hard to attribute things like this without a larger body of evidence,â\\x80\\x9d said Barry D. Keim, the Louisiana state climatologist. â\\x80\\x9cAnd, of course, the question keeps coming up: How large does that body of evidence have to get?â\\x80\\x9d But others said that the situation was quite clear. â\\x80\\x9cThis is exactly what scientists have been predicting,â\\x80\\x9d said the climate activist Bill McKibben. â\\x80\\x9cThe basic physics are simple: Warm air holds more water vapor, something that is turning out to be one of the most important facts of the 21st century. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd while Louisiana was flooding, there were also huge flood events underway in Moscow (biggest rains in 129 years of  ) the Sudan, Manila, and probably plenty of other places,â\\x80\\x9d he added. For the last four years, the American Meteorological Society has attempted to explain how climate change has influenced individual extreme weather events. However, that type of analysis, known as event attribution, is not yet available for the flooding in Louisiana. Rob Moore, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit, who focuses on climate changeâ\\x80\\x99s effect on water resources, said that state and local governments would have to change their approaches to keeping citizens safe from flooding. â\\x80\\x9cIf you look across all our natural disaster policies, theyâ\\x80\\x99re predicated on the wrong assumption that our flood risk in the future looks identical to our flood risk in the past,â\\x80\\x9d he said. He said that initiatives like the National Flood Insurance Program, which focuses on helping people rebuild in areas that have been flooded, were increasingly â\\x80\\x9cuntenable,â\\x80\\x9d given sea level rise. A report released earlier this month by the real estate sales company Zillow predicted that almost 1. 9 million homes, worth a combined $882 billion, would be lost to the rising sea levels  â\\x80\\x94   and the flooding likely to follow  â\\x80\\x94   that climate scientists expect to see by the year 2100. â\\x80\\x9cWhen Zillow starts warning about sea level rise, it may be time to start worrying about sea level rise,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Moore said.',\n",
       " 'MOSCOW/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russia said on Tuesday that the resignation of  radically minded  Syrian opposition figures such as Riyad Hijab would help unite the disparate opponents of President Bashar al-Assad around a more  realistic  platform. Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister, stepped down on Monday as head of the High Negotiations Committee (HNC) which was formed nearly two years ago with Saudi backing to bring together political and armed opponents of Assad.  The retreat of radically minded opposition figures from playing the main role will make it possible to unite this motley opposition   internal and external   on a more reasonable, realistic and constructive platform,  Russia s Rossiya 24 state television showed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov saying at a news briefing.  We will support the efforts made by Saudi Arabia in this respect.  After intervening decisively in Syria s war in 2015 to support Assad, Russia now hopes to build on the collapse of militant group Islamic State to revive a political process to end the more than six-year-old war. Hijab is one of up to 10 HNC members who have quit the opposition umbrella group, including Riyad Naasan Agha, who told Reuters its work had now been  brought to an end . Agha said the HNC, which has insisted on Assad s removal from power at the start of a political transition, had been marginalized ahead of a conference of the Syrian opposition which Saudi Arabia is due to host this week.  The  expanded  conference aims to forge a united position ahead of a new round of U.N.-backed peace talks toward ending the conflict that erupted in 2011. But Yahya al-Aridi, an HNC member who will be taking part in the Riyadh conference, said:  The HNC is not finished ... it is a technical group with a particular function to carry out, which is negotiations.    There are other Syrians who are still committed to the rights of Syrian people for freedom and liberty,  Aridi said.   Hijab did not spell out his reasons for stepping down in a statement on Monday night. The Syrian opposition has long been weakened by ideological and political divisions, exacerbated by ties to regional states with competing agendas such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia   countries that have been at loggerheads since June. In a telephone interview with Reuters, Agha said HNC members including Hijab and himself had not been invited to the Nov. 22-24 conference, and  in practical terms its work has been brought to an end . Agha said he did not know who had taken the decision to marginalize the HNC but would not blame the Saudi hosts.  Russia is behind overturning the scales of the opposition to be in the interest of Assad and not against him,  he said. ',\n",

       " 'How can my team make the N. F. L. playoffs? Itâ\\x80\\x99s a simple question, but answering it can be devilishly complicated. At this point in the season, when teams have six or seven games remaining, the playoff picture is delightfully foggy. For a normal fan  â\\x80\\x94   particularly one for whom sports are a blissful escape from, say, the tumultuous world of American electoral politics  â\\x80\\x94   itâ\\x80\\x99s surprisingly difficult to figure out. And, more often than not, the television commentators donâ\\x80\\x99t make things any easier. Itâ\\x80\\x99s always bothered us, too, so we built an interactive tool to help us understand. Our N. F. L. Playoff Simulator  â\\x80\\x94   now entering its third year of existence  â\\x80\\x94   is built for one purpose: to help you explore the paths to the playoffs for every team in the N. F. L. It works like this: We let you choose the outcomes of any game you select and simulate every other game remaining in the 2016 season. (In its first rendition, we considered each game a coin flip since then, weâ\\x80\\x99ve used Sagarin ratings, which reflect the fact that, even though anything can happen on a given Sunday, not all teams are created equal.) What makes this tool more useful than other online calculators, like the ones at ESPN, Yahoo or NFL. com, is that we do the work for you: Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no need to pick the outcomes of every game left in the season. Pick any outcomes  â\\x80\\x94   or none at all  â\\x80\\x94   and our tool will simulate the rest of the season for you, instantly identifying the most important games remaining for each team and turning you into a playoff scenarios expert. Consider the Minnesota Vikings, who started the season   but have slipped, in Minnesotan fashion, to  . At the moment, we give them just better than   odds of making the playoffs. If they beat the Cardinals in Minnesota on Sunday, their odds move to 64 percent. If they lose, those odds drop to about 40 percent. But what if the Detroit Lions, who share the Vikingsâ\\x80\\x99 record, lose all their remaining games? That kind of thinking is precisely what this tool was made for. Our simulator also lets you explore specific and unrealistic paths, like one in which the Vikings finish the season with the N. F. C. â\\x80\\x99s best record, a bye week and   advantage throughout the playoffs (roughly a    shot, but go for it). Finally, weâ\\x80\\x99ve added a feature this year, for fans of teams like the   Cleveland Browns, whose season is effectively over. We now let you use the simulator backward  â\\x80\\x94   to see how  the Browns could have their best shot at a No. 1 pick in the 2017 N. F. L. draft. As the season comes to an end, figuring out who will finish last can get just as complicated as figuring out who will finish first. If youâ\\x80\\x99re going to root against your own team, you might as well do it as intelligently as possible.',\n",

       " 'WYOMING, Del.  â\\x80\\x94   By his own account, Toby Lopez was a supremely ordinary guy. He sold Toyotas and lived with his mother in a tidy rancher here with a cherry tree out front. He was proud that he could connect with customers  â\\x80\\x94   anyone from a Superior Court judge to, as he put it, â\\x80\\x9cRedneck Bill from down on the farm. â\\x80\\x9d What passed for excitement was the time his young niece won a beauty contest and he chauffeured her in a red Corvette in a local parade. Then a high school friend was killed in Afghanistan, and the Islamic State began beheading American journalists. Horrified, Mr. Lopez heard on CNN one day in the fall of 2014 that the Islamic State was active on Twitter, and he went online to see what he could find. â\\x80\\x9cI was intrigued,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Lopez, 42. â\\x80\\x9cWhat could they possibly be saying on Twitter?â\\x80\\x9d What followed was a radical break from his humdrum life. He was pulled into the murky world of Internet jihadists, sparring with them from his office at the car dealership and late into the night at home. Before long, he was talking for hours on Skype with a man who claimed  â\\x80\\x94   falsely, as it would turn out  â\\x80\\x94   to be a top ISIS military commander, trying to negotiate the release of hostages. Mr. Lopez contacted the F. B. I. and began a testy relationship with counterterrorism agents who came to believe he might pose a danger. In the end, he landed in federal prison, where he was held for nearly 14 months without trial. The story of one manâ\\x80\\x99s deepening obsession with a terrorist group is a reminder of how the Internet provides easy portals to distant, sometimes dangerous worlds. It shows the complications for law enforcement agents who confront an overeager amateur encroaching on their turf. But it also underscores how lost a person can feel inside the criminal justice system. Deprived of his freedom, his sanity in question, Mr. Lopez found himself without a legal advocate he trusted or access to evidence he believed could free him. The hundreds of emails, text messages and recorded Skype calls that Mr. Lopez saved show him growing more and more frantic when F. B. I. agents did not see things his way. Believing American hostagesâ\\x80\\x99 lives were at stake, he sent an agent 80 increasingly overheated messages in 10 days. In one, he declared, â\\x80\\x9cJust remember whatever ends up happening to you   â\\x80¦     You deserved it,â\\x80\\x9d and added an expletive. On Feb. 11, 2015, a dozen police and F. B. I. cars surrounded the house with the cherry tree, arrested Mr. Lopez and charged him with transmitting a threat. He was shuttled among federal facilities in Pennsylvania, New York, Oklahoma and North Carolina. Without access to his records, prison psychologists assumed his tales of talking to Islamic State members were fiction, symptoms of a mental illness that made him incompetent to stand trial. Prosecutors sought a hearing to decide whether he should be forcibly medicated. The defense finally obtained a third mental health evaluation  â\\x80\\x94   the first one by a psychologist who had actually reviewed Mr. Lopezâ\\x80\\x99s voluminous files. It found him competent, and he was released on bail late last month. â\\x80\\x9cWithout having the documents,â\\x80\\x9d Kirk Heilbrun, a Drexel University psychologist, wrote in his March 2 evaluation, â\\x80\\x9cI would have concluded that his account of this entire series of events sounded both grandiose and delusional. Having reviewed these documents, however, I would not describe his account as delusional. â\\x80\\x9d On Friday, the United States attorneyâ\\x80\\x99s office in Delaware said it had taken the â\\x80\\x9cexceedingly rareâ\\x80\\x9d step of dropping the charges. â\\x80\\x9cWe have not hesitated to do so when the facts and law support such a decision,â\\x80\\x9d a statement said. In an interview last week, Mr. Lopezâ\\x80\\x99s voice broke as he described his prison ordeal. â\\x80\\x9cNobody deserves to get dragged through what I got dragged through, along with my family,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s sad that when someone does something with righteous intentions and gets treated by the government this way. â\\x80\\x9d By his own admission, Mr. Lopez knew almost nothing about the Islamic State before 2014. Athletic and   he had managed an Italian restaurant for years before becoming a car salesman. He became addicted to painkillers for a while, but he kicked the habit and has been off drugs for several years, he said. â\\x80\\x9cToby is your regular guy,â\\x80\\x9d said Mary Roloff, who is married to Mr. Lopezâ\\x80\\x99s half brother, Edward. At first, Mr. Lopez said, he started insulting people who praised the Islamic State on Twitter. Then he decided to learn more about his social media adversaries. He picked up a few Islamic terms online and began to engage the terrorist groupâ\\x80\\x99s supporters, even quoting the Quran to counter them. He found the anonymity of the Internet intoxicating. As he put it, nobody knew he was â\\x80\\x9clittle Toby, the car salesman from Delaware. â\\x80\\x9d On Google, Mr. Lopez discovered that one man who had engaged him on Twitter, calling himself @shishaniomar, seemed to be Omar   or Omar the Chechen, the nom de guerre of the military commander of the Islamic State. Soon the two were regularly chatting on Skype. By early November 2014, he had left his job, agreeing with his boss that his online life had become a distraction. The man who claimed to be the Islamic State commander regaled him with tales of battle, grumbled about condescending Arab bosses and called Mr. Lopez â\\x80\\x9cbrother. â\\x80\\x9d The man confided that he did not believe that Islam condoned the taking of women and children as slaves. Soon he asked Mr. Lopez to raise ransom to free hundreds of members of the Yazidi religious minority held hostage by the Islamic State. When relatives gathered for Thanksgiving in 2014 at the Roloffsâ\\x80\\x99 home near Baltimore, Mr. Lopez showed them jihadist videos and text message exchanges with Islamic State fans. â\\x80\\x9cWe love â\\x80\\x98CSI,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Roloff said. â\\x80\\x9cWe thought, â\\x80\\x98This is really cool.â\\x80\\x99 But some of what he shared with us  â\\x80\\x94   like videos of kids hanging from a tree  â\\x80\\x94   started to scare me. It was beyond our comprehension. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lopez contacted the F. B. I. and two agents visited his home and interviewed him, he said. Through Allan Ripp, a New York public relations specialist he found online, Mr. Lopez also contacted The New York Times. Two reporters visited him in January 2015 and spent several hours reviewing his emails, texts and audio recordings. But after checking with experts, the reporters concluded that Mr. Lopez was talking not to the real,   Mr. Shishani, but to an impostor. The actual commander did not speak fluent English, and the language overheard in the background of Skype calls was not Chechen, as the impostor claimed, but Kurdish. His multiple Twitter accounts had an antic tone he once posted a â\\x80\\x9cSimpsonsâ\\x80\\x9d cartoon about the Islamic State. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s definitely a fake,â\\x80\\x9d Joanna Paraszczuk, a British journalist and researcher who tracks the Chechens fighting in Syria, said by email. She said the same man had duped an Australian radio station into interviewing him but later admitted that he was not the ISIS commander, but a Kurdish immigrant to Scandinavia. The manâ\\x80\\x99s motive appeared to be money: He asked Mr. Lopez to bring the ransom to Sweden, supposedly to be forwarded to Syria. When the Times reporters told Mr. Lopez they did not believe he was dealing with the real Islamic State commander, he grew angry. He was hearing similar skepticism from the F. B. I. according to email exchanges with Jeffrey A. Reising, a senior counterterrorism agent based in Wilmington, Del. From the emails, it appears that Mr. Reising was exploring Mr. Lopezâ\\x80\\x99s contacts even as he tried to persuade him to disengage from the online jihadist world. But Mr. Lopez connected with a second Twitter user claiming to be an Islamic State figure who could get American hostages released, and Mr. Lopez tried to contact several hostagesâ\\x80\\x99 families. At least one of them complained to the F. B. I. Convinced that he could save lives, Mr. Lopez brushed off Mr. Reisingâ\\x80\\x99s warnings. He wrote dozens of emails to the F. B. I. some proposing that he talk to the bureauâ\\x80\\x99s director or even to President Obama. He focused on the case of Kayla Mueller, a    American aid worker being held by the Islamic State. His online contacts had suggested that she might be freed. Despite his doubts about Mr. Lopezâ\\x80\\x99s exploits, Mr. Reising appeared to believe he might have stumbled across useful information. â\\x80\\x9cCan you provide all contact information for the person on that chat?â\\x80\\x9d he wrote to Mr. Lopez on Feb. 4, 2015, referring to an exchange with a purported Islamic State representative. Near midnight, Mr. Lopez excitedly emailed the F. B. I. agent. â\\x80\\x9cI want to bring her home alive,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote. â\\x80\\x9cI know I can do it and I will look the PRESIDENT in his eyes and tell him exactly that   â\\x80¦     Anything else your fooling yourself and your in denial!! Good night!â\\x80\\x9d The weary F. B. I. agent replied: â\\x80\\x9cToby  â\\x80¦    . Seriously. Get some sleep. â\\x80\\x9d When Ms. Mueller was reported killed two days later in an airstrike, Mr. Lopez was furious and blamed the F. B. I. for not cooperating with him. His messages to the bureau grew more defiant. â\\x80\\x9cAny attempt to arrest me will be treated as a hostile act,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote to Mr. Reising. By then, agents had been informed by the Delaware State Police that Mr. Lopezâ\\x80\\x99s mother, Joyce Lopez, had told them that her son had a shotgun and was in a â\\x80\\x9cpoor mental state. â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Lopez, 78, said recently that she had simply asked whether the gun had to be registered. By Feb. 11, the F. B. I. had had enough. Mrs. Lopez arrived home to find her house surrounded. â\\x80\\x9cCars all over the place,â\\x80\\x9d she recalled. â\\x80\\x9cToby was standing there with his hands up. I said, â\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99s wrong? â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d The authorities had interpreted Mr. Lopezâ\\x80\\x99s heated emails as a â\\x80\\x9cthreat to injureâ\\x80\\x9d Mr. Reising, a crime with a sentence of up to five years. Mr. Lopez said later that he had threatened only to expose what he considered government bungling to the news media. He was locked up, and federal prosecutors soon sought a court order for a mental health assessment. At an initial court hearing in Wilmington, family members urged Mr. Lopezâ\\x80\\x99s public defender, Daniel I. Siegel, to collect the records of his online contacts, which they thought showed his intentions were good. By their account, Mr. Siegel ignored their pleas. â\\x80\\x9cHe just said, â\\x80\\x98Your brother is very sick and he needs help,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Ms. Roloff recalled. Mr. Lopez said Mr. Siegel never came to see him in the year that followed, as he cycled through the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan (where he surprised a few terrorism defendants with Arabic phrases) a medical prison in Butner, N. C. (where he played on the softball team) and three other facilities. The first two psychological evaluations found that Mr. Lopez was suffering from â\\x80\\x9cdelusional disorder, grandiose type. â\\x80\\x9d To Mr. Lopezâ\\x80\\x99s distress, Mr. Siegel did not contest the findings. A year into Mr. Lopezâ\\x80\\x99s imprisonment, after complaints from his family and reportersâ\\x80\\x99 inquiries, Edson A. Bostic, the chief federal public defender in Delaware, took over the case. He quickly obtained from the family the files documenting Mr. Lopezâ\\x80\\x99s online history and arranged for the third psychological assessment. Dr. Heilbrun, the Drexel psychologist, declared in his report that if Mr. Lopez had not been talking with the real Mr. Shishani (who was killed last month) then someone posing as the Islamic State commander had pulled off â\\x80\\x9ca clever, detailed, and   hoax. â\\x80\\x9d In a statement on Friday, Mr. Bostic called the case â\\x80\\x9ca complex matterâ\\x80\\x9d and praised Mr. Siegelâ\\x80\\x99s record of representing indigent clients. But he said the complaints from Mr. Lopez and his family would be investigated. Mr. Siegel did not respond to emails seeking comment. Now that the charges have been dropped, Mr. Lopez, who missed two family weddings while in prison, is reconnecting with friends and relatives. â\\x80\\x9cAll over you see those billboards that say, â\\x80\\x98See Something Say Something,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said Tana Stevens, Mr. Lopezâ\\x80\\x99s sister. â\\x80\\x9cHe tried to do that. And they basically kidnapped him for 14 months. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Lopez said he had consulted lawyers and was considering a lawsuit against the government officials responsible for his incarceration. â\\x80\\x9cIf I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t gotten another evaluation, I might still be sitting down at Butner, with a needle in my arm,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThis was the United States of America, flexing its muscles on me. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

It isnâ\\x80\\x99t even domestic violence. What is the leading cause of murder in Carson City? According to Sheriff Ken Furlong, itâ\\x80\\x99s marijuana. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s against that law,â\\x80\\x9d Furlong told local ABC affiliate, KOLO 8. â\\x80\\x9cIt does change peopleâ\\x80\\x99s attitude and we do see people dying as a result of it, needlessly, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no excuse for it. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the last 13-15 years, all of the violence weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen that has turned deadly, have [sic] been in someway related to a marijuana issue.â\\x80\\x9d \\nBefore you get too excited, thinking Furlong nailed it â\\x80\\x94 the fact cannabis remains a federal Schedule 1 drug and thus technically illegal in the ongoing yet utterly failed war on drugs â\\x80\\x94 that isnâ\\x80\\x99t all he had to say on the matter. \\nKOLO 8 noted the 2016 deaths of 18-year-old Grant Watkins and 40-year-old Dennis Watkins, Jr. â\\x80\\x94 both killed during transactions involving the sale of cannabis. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cDuring a transaction, they set it up, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to sell this to you,â\\x80\\x99 then all of a sudden someone gets shot and killed,â\\x80\\x9d Furlong continued. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not because they were under the influence; itâ\\x80\\x99s because they were doing something deadly and it turned out that way.â\\x80\\x9d \\nAs Furlong explained, the threat to life isnâ\\x80\\x99t due to the drugâ\\x80\\x99s effects on the system, per se , but the â\\x80\\x98culture and crimesâ\\x80\\x99 surrounding it â\\x80\\x98that can be overwhelming,â\\x80\\x99 as KOLO 8 paraphrased. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a very cherished culture and people have very strong beliefs,â\\x80\\x9d the Sheriff elaborated. â\\x80\\x9cWhen you violate someoneâ\\x80\\x99s beliefs, you put them in a position where they can act out.â\\x80\\x9d \\nBut Furlongâ\\x80\\x99s complete lack of understanding of all things cannabis â\\x80\\x94 including both medicinal and recreational aspects â\\x80\\x94 didnâ\\x80\\x99t stop there. According to the Sheriff, the community faces repercussions following a law enforcement drug bust â\\x80\\x94 because addicts suddenly have no way to procure their â\\x80¦ cannabis. \\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re watching very closely, not only for a spike in crime, but for people who are in critical need of medical care because of that lack of treatment, based on withdrawal from the drug,â\\x80\\x9d he asserted. \\nYes, you read that right. Carson Cityâ\\x80\\x99s Sheriff-in-charge firmly believes depriving people of cannabis â\\x80\\x94 a plant scientifically and anecdotally proven to save lives â\\x80\\x94 will lead to a crime wave and health crisis of no small proportions. \\nBut what he explained next, as paraphrased by KOLO 8, harkens back to the earliest days of cannabis prohibition and the propagandist classic, Reefer Madness: \\nâ\\x80\\x98Sheriff Furlong says unlike other drugs like heroin or methamphetamines that can distort your mind, people using marijuana usually have rational trains of thought which give them the ability to act out and become violent when someone takes away or violates their drug.â\\x80\\x99 \\nAt this point, if youâ\\x80\\x99re having a good laugh, stunned, or shaking your head, you most certainly are not alone. \\nObviously, Sheriff Furlong grasps the potential perils in black market trade â\\x80\\x94 but he wholly fails to recognize removing cannabisâ\\x80\\x99 illegality would thus remove the risk of violence. When the State is removed from consensual business transactions, individuals are free to conduct trade as they see fit â\\x80\\x94 if cannabis were abundant and legal, it would be highly unlikely people would continue killing each other over soured deals. \\nBut Furlongâ\\x80\\x99s stupefying lack of knowledge concerning the effects cannabis has on the body, though certainly laughable, also should concern the residents heâ\\x80\\x99s tasked with overseeing. \\nMischaracterizing cannabis so broadly as to believe it will warp peopleâ\\x80\\x99s minds to a heightened frenzy where theyâ\\x80\\x99re likely to commit violence is downright dangerous. \\nFor one thing, this inexcusable misperception could color the training Sheriff Furlong decides to give law enforcement trainees and officers. Considering the absolutely epidemic national spate of violence inflicted by trigger-happy cops who already seem to have an irrational fear of the public, training them to further view cannabis users as likely to act out physically is nothing short of dangerous. \\nIf sheriffâ\\x80\\x99s deputies conduct a raid on a residence known for cannabis transactions with the preconception the people inside could turn violent instantly, itâ\\x80\\x99s arguable they would be more likely to misinterpret anything they encounter. This unnecessarily heightened fear that their life could be in peril from a cannabis-crazed maniac would have obvious influence on their decisions for whether or not to employ deadly force. \\nSadly, Sheriff Furlong likely isnâ\\x80\\x99t alone among law enforcement in the United States. As long as the drug war remains firmly entrenched in policy and culture, dangerous misunderstandings and lack of knowledge will arguably be the greater source of violence than would the substances be were they not illegal. \\nIn the meantime, while forced to pick apart drug laws state by state, perhaps drug and cannabis education â\\x80\\x94 not fear- and prohibition-based propaganda, but serious education â\\x80\\x94 should be mandatory in law enforcement training.

       " 'BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai authorities have arrested a local tour guide for indecent behavior at a temple after she posted a photograph online that showed her standing on a pagoda, police said on Saturday. The arrest came as photographs of Naranon Narakamin 44  circulated on social media earlier in the week, including one that showed her standing behind a tourist with one of her foot placed on a pagoda at Bangkok s iconic Temple of Dawn. It is unclear when the photograph of Naranon was taken but it has outraged many conservatives who say her behavior was  disrespectful to Buddhism. Tourist Police Deputy commissioner Police Major General Surachet Hakpal told a press conference on Saturday that the tour guide has exhibited  inappropriate behavior at a Buddhist temple,  and set a bad example for Thais and foreign tourists.  Naranon, who has publicly apologized for her action, will be charged with breaching the national archaeological site act and could face up to one month jail term and a fine of up to 10,000 baht ($307.50), the police said. In Thailand, using feet to point at people or objects, particularly sacred objects is considered very rude. Revealing clothing and inappropriate action at places of worship is also considered offensive in the predominantly Buddhist country. Last month two American tourists were arrested and fined for public indecency after posing for a  butt selfie  at a temple in Bangkok. ',\n",
       " 'Why are Americans expected to die sooner than their peers in other high-income countries?\\n\\nA new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association takes a look at the question. The results are, well, not too surprising â\\x80\\x94 three of the big drivers for the year analyzed, 2012, were guns, drugs, and cars.\\n\\nThe study looked at these causes of injury deaths, which are the three biggest causes of injury death in the US and altogether account for more than 100,000 early deaths each year in America. It compared how common these deaths are in the US versus other high-income countries â\\x80\\x94 the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, and eight others â\\x80\\x94 with 2012 data from the US National Vital Statistics System and the World Health Organization Mortality Database.\\n\\nIt found that, on average, men and women in the other high-income countries can expect to live about 2.2 years longer than men and women in the US â\\x80\\x94 and guns, drugs, and cars played a prominent role.\\n\\nAmong men, gun deaths explained 21 percent of the gap, drug overdoses 14 percent, and car crashes 13 percent. And among women, gun deaths explained 4 percent, drug overdoses 9 percent, and car crashes 6 percent.\\n\\nIn total, the death rate for guns, drugs, and cars was much, much higher in the US than its developed peers, as this chart shows:\\n\\n\"Although the reasons for the gap in life expectancy at birth between the United States and comparable countries are complex,\" study authors Andrew Fenelon, Li-Hui Chen, and Susan Baker wrote, \"a substantial portion of this gap reflects just three causes of injury.\"\\n\\nSo why do Americans die more from these causes? There are cultural factors, but bad policy plays a role too.\\n\\nWith guns, the research shows that America\\'s unusually high levels of gun ownership lead to more gun violence. Other factors, such as socioeconomic issues, contribute to violence, but guns are the one issue that makes America unique relative to other developed countries in comparable socioeconomic circumstances. (To learn more about America\\'s gun problem, read Vox\\'s explainer.)\\n\\n\"A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,\" UC Berkeley\\'s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins wrote in a breakthrough analysis in 1999. \"A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.\"\\n\\nSome research also shows tightening existing gun control measures in the US would help: Studies in both Connecticut and Missouri suggested that gun licensing laws in those states helped reduce homicides and suicides.\\n\\nWith drugs, America is now in the middle of a harrowing opioid and heroin epidemic that\\'s killing tens of thousands of people each year. (For an in-depth dive on this topic, read Vox\\'s explainer.)\\n\\nAcademic analyses of the crisis have concluded that the US was too slow to respond to misleading advertising campaigns from opioid producers, in which they claimed that their drugs were safe and effective. Americans have suffered the consequences, getting addicted to and dying from opioid painkillers and heroin as pharmaceutical companies have massively profited.\\n\\nWith cars, by the 1960s European policies began encouraging walking, cycling, and public transportation. The US, meanwhile, continued to encourage sprawl and driving. The result: Americans drive much more than their European peers, and are more likely to die in crashes as a result. (To learn more about US and European transportation policy, read Ralph Buehler\\'s great explainer at the Atlantic\\'s CityLab.)\\n\\nEven perfect policies might not fix all of these problems â\\x80\\x94 Americans, after all, love their guns, drugs, and cars, and that cultural preference will likely remain strong for some time. But better policies could push the US in the right direction â\\x80\\x94 and save lives.',\n",

[â\\x80\\x9cWhile Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said in a statement sent to reporters.

       " 'Donald or Hillary: A Decision Between Life and Death November 08, 2016 Donald or Hillary: A Decision Between Life and Death \\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump have taken starkly different views on life and family issues. While both candidates may be \"flawed\" from the perspective of moral values, a breakdown of their positions shows clearly that America will go down one of two very different roads today. \\nBelow are some of the candidates\\' more notable stances and quotes on moral issues, as well as the positions each party platform takes. \\nABORTION \\nHillary Clinton: supports taxpayer-funded abortion through all nine months of pregnancy. has promised to repeal the Hyde Amendment, the law prohibiting the use of tax dollars for Medicaid abortions. said she will stand with and fund Planned Parenthood, America\\'s largest abortion provider. defended partial-birth and late-term abortion in her final debate with Donald Trump. Here are some of her most notable abortion quotes: \"The unborn person doesn\\'t have constitutional rights.\" \"Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources, and political will. Deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed.\" \"I believe that forcing a woman to carry a child who she knows will die is an assault...\" \"[Family] planning is an important part of women\\'s health, and reproductive health includes access to abortion.\" \"We\\'ve gotta continue to stand up for a woman\\'s right to make these decisions--and to defend Planned Parenthood.\" \"I support Roe v. Wade.\" \"Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and health of the mother are taken into account and when I voted as a senator [against banning partial-birth abortion], I did not think that that was [the] case.\" \"The kinds of [abortion] cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get: that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term, or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions for women. So, you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and health of the mother taken into account...this is one of the worst possible choices any woman and her family has to make.\" \"I\\'ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions like they used to do in China or force women to bear children like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you the government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice, and I will stand up for that right.\" \"Now, extreme views about women, we expect that from some of the terrorist groups, we expect that from people who donâ\\x80\\x99t want to live in the modern world, but itâ\\x80\\x99s a little hard to take from Republicans who want to be the president of the United States.\" \"Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been proud to stand with Planned Parenthood for a long time, and, as president, I will always have your back.\" \"I\\'m grateful to the entire Planned Parenthood family. You made this campaign your own...It belongs to the staff, the donors, and to the [abortion] providers...It is worth saying again: defending womenâ\\x80\\x99s health means defending access to abortion â\\x80\\x93 not just in theory, but in reality...We need to stand up for access to affordable contraception without interference from politicians or employers. And let\\'s invest in long-acting contraceptives, so every woman can choose the method that is best for her.â\\x80\\x9d \\nDonald Trump: promised to sign the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would end painful, gruesome late-term abortions. pledged to defund Planned Parenthood. says he will appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices. Here are some of Trump\\'s more notable quotes on abortion: â\\x80\\x9cIf you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that thatâ\\x80\\x99s okay, and Hillary can say that thatâ\\x80\\x99s okay, but itâ\\x80\\x99s not okay with me because based on what sheâ\\x80\\x99s saying and based on where she\\'s going and where she\\'s been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s not acceptable...Honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth, nobody has that.\" \"I am, and will remain, pro-life.\" \"Let me be clear â\\x80\\x94 I am pro-life. I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me...Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago, over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of this country. They are missing, and they are missed. The Supreme Court in 1973 based its decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found...Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best...A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness. It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again.\" \\nRELIGIOUS FREEEDOM \\nHillary Clinton: has said \"religious beliefs\" against abortion \"have to be changed.\" supports the Obama administration\\'s HHS contraception and abortion mandate, which forces religious institutions and churches to fund abortions. Here are some of her more notable quotes on religious freedom: \"Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources, and political will. Deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed.\" â\\x80\\x9c[The Hobby Lobby case is] the first time that our court has said that a closely held corporation has the rights of a person when it comes to religious freedom, which means the corporationâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80¦ [â\\x80\\x98closely heldâ\\x80\\x99] employers can impose their religious beliefs on their employees, and, of course, denying women the right to contraceptives as part of a health care plan is exactly that. I find it deeply disturbing that we are going in that direction. Itâ\\x80\\x99s very troubling that a sales clerk at Hobby Lobby who need[s] contraception, which is pretty expensive, is not going to get that service through her employerâ\\x80\\x99s health care plan because her employer doesnâ\\x80\\x99t think she should be using contraception.\" \"Every woman, no matter where she works, deserves birth control coverage. This shouldn\\'t be a question.\" \\nDonald Trump: has promised to repeal the Johnson Amendment, which threatens churches with the loss of their tax statuses if they endorse political candidates. says he will fight on behalf of Christians in the Middle East who are facing genocide. Here are some of his more notable quotes on religious freedom: \"I have a message for Catholics: I will be there for you. I will stand with you. I will fight for you. \"As First Lady, US Senator, Secretary of State, and two-time presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton has been hostile to the core issues and policies of greatest concern to Catholics: life, religious liberty, Supreme Court nominations, affordable and quality healthcare, educational choice and home schooling. \"For instance, Hillary Clinton supports forcing The Little Sisters of the Poor who have taken care of the elderly poor since 1839, to pay for contraceptives in their healthcare plan (even though they have never wanted them, never used them and never will), and having the government fine them heavily if they continue to refuse to abide by this onerous mandate. \"This is a hostility to religious liberty you will never see in a Trump administration.\" \"I will defend your religious liberties and the right to fully and freely practice your religion, as individuals, business owners and academic institutions. I will make absolutely certain religious orders like The Little Sisters of Poor are not bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs. I will protect and work to expand educational choice, the rights of homeschooling families, and end Common Core. I will repeal and replace Obamacare so you can have better and more affordable healthcare. I will keep our country and communities safe while respecting the dignity of each human being. I will help Catholic families and workers, and all families and workers, by bringing jobs back to our country where they belong. And I will appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not legislate from the bench, like Justice Clarence Thomas and the late and beloved great Catholic thinker and jurist, Justice Antonin Scalia.\" \\n\\nSAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND THE LGBT MOVEMENT \\nHillary Clinton: touts herself as a champion of the \"LGBT community.\" wants to criminalize therapy helping minors resolve unwanted same-sex attraction. will \"protect transgender rights.\" says she will \"fight for full federal equality for LGBT Americans\" by making gender identity and sexual orientation federally protected classes. Here are a few of her many pro-LGBT statements: \"Gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\" \"Thanks to the bravery of LGBT Americans like Jim Obergefell and Edie Windsor, and the determination and tireless organizing of the LGBT community and their allies, marriage equality became the law of the land in all 50 states...we\\'ve also seen how much work is still unfinished....Discriminatory laws in states like North Carolina highlight the need for full federal equality under the law for LGBT Americans.\" \"Along with millions of Americans, I am celebrating today\\'s landmark victory for marriage equality, and the generations of advocates and activists who fought to make it possible. From Stonewall to the Supreme Court, the courage and determination of the LGBT community has changed hearts and changed laws. \"This ruling is an affirmation of the commitment of couples across the country who love one another. It reflects the will of the vast and growing multitude of Americans who believe that LGBT couples deserve to be recognized under the law and treated equally in the eyes of society. And it represents our country at its best: inclusive, open, and striving towards true equality. \"But we know that the struggle for LGBT rights doesn\\'t end with today\\'s triumph. As love and joy flood our streets today, it is hard to imagine how anyone could deny the full protection of our laws to any of our fellow Americansâ\\x80\\x94but there are those who would. So while we celebrate the progress won today, we must stand firm in our conviction to keep moving forward. For too many LGBT Americans who are subjected to discriminatory laws, true equality is still just out of reach. While we celebrate today, our work won\\'t be finished until every American can not only marry, but live, work, pray, learn and raise a family free from discrimination and prejudice. We cannot settle for anything less.\" \"I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.\" \\nDonald Trump: says marriage is ultimately an issue that should be decided by the states. says he supports natural marriage. says that he will \"fight\" for the LGBT community, especially as he fights ISIS and radical Islam. Here are some of Trump\\'s more notable quotes on same-sex \"marriage\" and the \"LGBT community\": â\\x80\\x9cThank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.â\\x80\\x9d \"As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.\" \"Weâ\\x80\\x99re going to look at judges. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve got to be great judges. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve got to be conservative judges. Weâ\\x80\\x99re going to see how they stand depending on what their views are. But that would be my preference [that they oppose same-sex \\'marriage]. I would prefer that they stand against, but weâ\\x80\\x99ll see what happens. It depends on the judge.\" â\\x80\\x9cI would strongly consider that, yes,\" in response to a question about whether he would appoint justices to overrule the Supreme Court\\'s same-sex \"marriage\" decision. â\\x80\\x9c[Marriage] should be a states rights issue. I can see changes coming down the line, frankly.â\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nTHE CANDIDATE\\'S CAMPAIGN WEBSITES \\nFrom the official Hillary Clinton campaign site: \"Hillary will work with Congress to pass the Equality Act, continue President Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s LGBT equality executive actions, and support efforts underway in the courts to protect people from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation in every aspect of public life...Hillary will end so-called \\'conversion therapy\\' for minors, combat youth homelessness by ensuring adequate funding for safe and welcoming shelters, and take on bullying and harassment in schools. Sheâ\\x80\\x99ll end discriminatory treatment of LGBT families in adoptions, and protect LGBT elders against discrimination....Hillary applauds the Pentagonâ\\x80\\x99s decision to allow transgender personnel to serve openly, and as Commander-in-Chief, she will upgrade service records of LGBT veterans dismissed due to their sexual orientation...Hillary will work to protect transgender individuals from violence, make it easier for transgender Americans to change their gender marker on identification documents, and invest in law enforcement training focused on fair and impartial policing, including in interactions with LGBT people.\" \"Hillary will promote LGBT human rights and ensure Americaâ\\x80\\x99s foreign policy is inclusive of LGBT people, including increasing our investment in the Global Equality Fund to advance human rights.\" \"In the U.S. Senate, Hillary championed legislation to address hate crimes, fought for federal non-discrimination legislation to protect LGBT Americans in the workplace, and advocated for an end to restrictions that blocked LGBT Americans from adopting children. \"As secretary of state, Hillary advanced LGBT rights abroad and enforced stronger anti-discrimination regulations within the State Department, declaring on the global stage that \\'gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\\' She led the effort to pass the first-ever U.N. Resolution on LGBT Human Rights, launched the Global Equality Fund, ended State Department regulations that denied same-sex couples and their families equal rights, helped implement LGBT-friendly workplace policies, and updated the State Departmentâ\\x80\\x99s policy so that transgender individualsâ\\x80\\x99 passports reflect their true gender.\" \\nDonald Trump\\'s official campaign website does not mention his stances on abortion or marriage. \\n\\nTHE PARTY PLATFORMS \\nRepublican platform: Against abortion, against Planned Parenthood, pro-religious liberty, pro-marriage, pro-homeschooling, pro-sexual risk avoidance education â\\x80\\x9cThe Constitutionâ\\x80\\x99s guarantee that no one can \\'be deprived of life, liberty or property\\' deliberately echoes the Declaration of Independenceâ\\x80\\x99s proclamation that \\'all\\' are \\'endowed by their Creator\\' with the inalienable right to life. Accordingly, we assert the sanctity of human life and afrm that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendmentâ\\x80\\x99s protections apply to children before birth.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe oppose the use of public funds to perform or promote abortion or to fund organizations, like Planned Parenthood, so long as they provide or refer for elective abortions or sell fetal body parts rather than provide healthcare.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.\" â\\x80\\x9cWe value the right of Americaâ\\x80\\x99s religious leaders to preach, and Americans to speak freely, according to their faith. Republicans believe the federal government, specically the IRS, is constitutionally prohibited from policing or censoring speech based on religious convictions or beliefs, and therefore we urge the repeal of the Johnson Amendment.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe support options for learning, including home-schooling, career and technical education, private or parochial schools, magnet schools, charter schools, online learning, and early-college high schools. We especially support the innovative nancing mechanisms that make options available to all children: education savings accounts (ESAs), vouchers, and tuition tax credits.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe renew our call for replacing \\'family planning\\' programs for teens with sexual risk avoidance education that sets abstinence until marriage as the responsible and respected standard of behavior.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe condemn the Supreme Courtâ\\x80\\x99s ruling in United States v. Windsor, which wrongly removed the ability of Congress to dene marriage policy in federal law. We also condemn the Supreme Courtâ\\x80\\x99s lawless ruling in Obergefell v. Hodgesâ\\x80¦.In Obergefell, ve unelected lawyers robbed 320 million Americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to dene marriage as the union of one man and one woman.â\\x80\\x9d \\nDemocrat platform: Taxpayer funded abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, pro-Planned Parenthood, pro-LGBT, pro-contraception sex ed â\\x80\\x9cDemocrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice. We believe unequivocally that every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortionâ\\x80\\x94regardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured. We believe that reproductive health is core to womenâ\\x80\\x99s, menâ\\x80\\x99s, and young peopleâ\\x80\\x99s health and wellbeingâ\\x80¦. We will continue to opposeâ\\x80\\x94and seek to overturnâ\\x80\\x94federal and state laws and policies that impede a womanâ\\x80\\x99s access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide critical health services to millions of people.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe will appoint judges who defend the constitutional principles of liberty and equality for all, protect a womanâ\\x80\\x99s right to safe and legal abortion, curb billionairesâ\\x80\\x99 inuence over elections because they understand that Citizens United has fundamentally damaged our democracy, and see the Constitution as a blueprint for progress.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDemocrats know that our nation, our communities, and our lives are made vastly stronger and richer by faith in many forms and the countless acts of justice, mercy, and tolerance it inspires. We believe in lifting up and valuing the good work of people of faith and religious organizations and nding ways to support that work where possible.\" â\\x80\\x9cDemocrats are also committed to providing parents with high-quality public school options and expanding these options for low-income youth. We support great neighborhood public schools and high-quality public charter schools, and we will help them disseminate best practices to other school leaders and educators. Democrats oppose for-prot charter schools focused on making a prot off of public resources.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe recognize that quality, affordable comprehensive health care, evidence-based sex education, and a full range of family planning services help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies.\" â\\x80\\x9cDemocrats applaud last yearâ\\x80\\x99s decision by the Supreme Court that recognized LGBT peopleâ\\x80\\x94like every other Americanâ\\x80\\x94have the right to marry the person they love.

       " 'Donald Trump thanked his poorly educated supporters for helping him win Nevada earlier this week, thus opening himself up to the mocking he received from Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday night.Trump proudly declared during his victory speech after capturing the Nevada caucus: We won with poorly educated! I love the poorly educated! Trump destroyed his GOP rivals by a landslide, taking just another step closer toward becoming the Republican nominee.But Jimmy Kimmel saw an opportunity to not only mock Trump, but to accurately depict his supporters at the same time.And that s why he presented a hilarious campaign ad by Poorly-Educated Americans for Trump.After playing a clip of Trump declaring his love of the poorly educated, Kimmel quipped,  They feel the same way about you. In fact, they love Trump so much that they made this ad just for him, Kimmel continued.The ad began with Trump riding an escalator down to the podium to give his announcement that he is running for president. And as he does so, the narrator says,  In dangerous times, Americans need a leader But on the screen the word is misspelled as  LEEDER,  reminiscent of the misspelled signs that Tea Party supporters have carried during rallies.The ad goes on to misspell other words as well, including  terists.  The ad then states that we need a president who will lock down the border to keep immigrants from coming from Mexico, which the poorly educated think is located where Canada is on the map.In addition, the ad praises Trump for standing up to  Lil  Kim,  in North Korea,  Voldemort Putin  in Russia, and President XI (pronounced  eleven  in the ad) in China while honoring the principles outlined in the  US Constipation  and the second commandment in which God says  Thou shalt have guns.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wilbur Ross, President-elect Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s nominee for Commerce Secretary, has pledged to sell his stake in his main private equity firm and resign from corporate boards but will keep his interests in mortgage lending and shipping. In an ethics agreement published on Tuesday, the billionaire investor vowed to sell shares in Invesco Ltd (IVZ.N), the parent company of W.L. Ross & Co, valued at up to $50 million. He also pledged to divest other assets worth between $77 million and $209 million to prevent conflicts of interest. He is due to be questioned by members of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on Wednesday at a confirmation hearing. The federal disclosure forms for presidential appointees allow asset values to be listed in wide ranges with a maximum threshold of â\\x80\\x9cover $50 millionâ\\x80\\x9d. Picked by Trump to lead an agenda aimed at shrinking U.S. trade deficits with China and Mexico, the 79-year-old Ross is estimated by Forbes to be worth about $2.5 billion. His asset sales would represent a small portion of that total. Ross earned his fortune in part by running businesses that have offshored thousands of U.S. jobs, according to Labor Department data seen by Reuters.  He once served under former U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of a fund set up by the U.S. government to make private investments in Russia, and worked as a privatization advisor to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Ross said he would divest financial interests in some 80 entities, including ownership stakes in companies and investment partnerships, stocks and bonds. He said he would retain his holdings in nine entities related to his mortgage finance and trans-oceanic shipping assets, but will resign positions he has in those companies and partnerships. The disclosure form lists the valuations of those interests at about $8 million to $36 million. He will also resign from positions at 22 of the business entities from which he is divesting, including giving up his board seats at steelmaker ArcelorMittal ISPA.AS and Bank of Cyprus BOC.CY, and at chemicals and plastics distributor Nexeo Solutions (NXEO.O) where he is chairman of the board. His stake in Nexeo is the largest single investment that he plans to sell, valued in the 57-page financial disclosure at $25 million to $50 million. His steel industry investments may have brought Ross the most unfavorable media coverage. He listed his shares in ArcelorMittal, which bought his International Steel Group in 2004, as being worth $750,000 to $1.5 million.   Other assets that Ross intends to keep include two cash accounts holding more than $50 million each, the largest reporting threshold required on the forms, and an art collection valued at more than $50 million.

       " 'Headlined to H3 10/26/16 - Advertisement - Philippines president Duterte announces \\'separation\\' from US during China visit Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte announced his \\'separation\\' from the United States, expressing his desire for the Philippines to become more dependent ... License DMCA \\nPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte in Beijing, China announcing separation from the United States Considering US belligerence in the world particularly since 9/11, the idea of a countries elected leader standing up and defying the US hyper power is something to behold. The latest leader to exercise his countries right of sovereignty is Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte speaking during a state visit to Beijing, China announced, \"Your honors, in this venue, I announce my separation from the United States...both in military and economics also\".[1] He said, \"America has lost\" while announcing a new alliance the Philippines, China and Russia, \"there are three of us against the world\". Of course Duterte is not the first leader to poke his middle finger at the US imperialist. Fidel Castro did it with Cuba in 1959, as did Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1999. Two at least who spoke truth to power, put his people first at great risk to himself when they separated their country from US hegemony over them, survived many US attempts to undermine or assassinate and overthrow them. There\\'s too many others to mention here that didn\\'t survive or were overthrown in CIA initiated coups, color revolutions, regime change et al. Is this somehow subversive coming from an American extolling foreign leaders that have defied the US? Or is it an acknowledgement that we, the US, can\\'t dictate to the world. That it\\'s a countries elected leaders purpose to exercise his judgment to do right by his people, follow an independent course to best serve his people, not be subservient and dictated to by the US. If the people disagree with such a leader they can elect someone else or impeach him for felonious behavior. Maybe that\\'s a bit naive, too ideal for the complex world we live in today. - Advertisement - But we as a country have completely lost our way, been an imperialist bully, initiating illegal wars and occupations, aggression against countries that are no threat, imminent or otherwise to America. Authorized torture, indefinite detention, extraordinary rendition, kill innocents in drone strikes and missile attacks, order the targeted assassination of anyone, anywhere, including American citizens if the president alone so decides. Initiate coups and regime change against any country that defies the US while conducting surveillance of ALL electronic communications of everyone in the world. This is not the behavior of a country capable of having mutual respect for others particularly those countries taking an independent course and not bowing to US diktat. We Americans can close our eyes, pretend or ignore what we have become; a rogue actor on the world stage. Yes rogue. What gave us the right to be the \"indispensible country\", exceptional, entitled, run roughshod against any leader-Putin being the leader now most demonized in US crosshairs. As for the Philippines, we took it as well as Cuba and Puerto Rico; booty from Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish American war of 1898. - Advertisement - Of course earlier in our countries inglorious history we stole much of what is now California, Texas and the southwest from Mexico while committing genocide and stealing most of the arable and tribal lands of the indigenous native peoples all in the name of \"manifest destiny\", as if it was some benign, natural, yet inexorable happenstance. Yeah right. Let\\'s admit it. Today we\\'re the beneficiaries of our countries earlier \"successful\" aggression against the indigenous peoples as well as a country built on slavery; peoples the government has never formally apologized to. We can ignore the truth of this aggressive history, believe it to have been the inevitable consequence overthrowing British colonialism and ridding the country of what the government and most white people then referred to as Indian \"savages\". Then later came the masses of millions of mostly European immigrants; those ancestors who came to America, a consequence of repression, lack of opportunity, religious intolerance they suffered in their native countries. And with them the American demographic changed forever from its colonial past. So now we\\'re a mass of different peoples, mostly adapted to our earlier British colonial heritage, \"connected\" to those who threw off British tyranny, declared their independence, formed a union and soon thereafter a formal constitution of rights under the rule of law. A country that began not wanting to engage in foreign entanglements, fiercely independent, embracing the protestant work ethic, most probably considered inward looking by today\\'s standards. It feels quaint, distant, a different sort of people than most in America now.',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday put a restrictive Republican-backed Arizona ballot-collection law on hold until after Tuesdayâ\\x80\\x99s election, handing Democrats a victory in an intensifying state-by-state legal battle over access to the polls.  Arizonaâ\\x80\\x99s legislature earlier this year passed the law  prohibiting advocacy groups from collecting completed early ballots from voters and delivering them to election offices as part of get-out-the-vote efforts.  Plaintiffs in the case, including the Democratic National Committee, argued the law is unconstitutional because it unfairly impacted the ability of minorities to vote. Polls have shown Republican Donald Trump with a small lead in Arizona over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this week agreed to revisit a ruling that had refused to block the law and hear the case before an 11-judge panel. That panel voted 6-5 on Friday to prohibit Arizona from enforcing the law now, court records showed. Arizona filed an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court later on Friday, asking it to reverse the 9th Circuitâ\\x80\\x99s order. Democrats have accused Republicans of enacting state laws intended to make it harder for minorities and others who tend to back Democratic candidates to cast ballots. Republicans have called these laws necessary to guard against voting fraud. Judge Sidney Thomas, the 9th Circuitâ\\x80\\x99s chief judge, wrote that the courtâ\\x80\\x99s action would not disrupt Arizonaâ\\x80\\x99s ability to conduct the U.S. presidential election.  â\\x80\\x9cIt simply would enjoin enforcement of a legislative act that would criminalize the collection, by persons other than the voter, of legitimately cast ballots,â\\x80\\x9d Thomas wrote. He was joined by five other judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Five dissenting 9th Circuit judges, all Republican appointees, argued that the court should not have interfered with Arizona law so close to Election Day, while early voting is already underway. The 9th Circuit covers nine Western states, including Arizona. â\\x80\\x9cWe are disappointed in this decision as it will confuse voters and depress turnout,â\\x80\\x9d Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan said in a statement. A representative for the Democratic National Committee could not immediately be reached for comment. Acting in another voting case on Friday, a U.S. judge in Ohio ordered Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s campaign not to verbally harass voters near polling places or take pictures of them in the key battleground state.

       " 'Nothing to see here just Obama evening the playing field by giving an ad hoc international tribunal the ability to overrule US laws and allow them to levy fines against the US the American taxpayer would be responsible for paying. It is really worrisome,  said top House Ways and Means Committee Democrat Rep. Sandy Levin.  Countries do not want to give away their jurisdiction away to some arbitrary panel,  he added.At issue is the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership treaty and a provision called  Investor-State Dispute Settlement,  or ISDS, that would let foreign firms challenge U.S. laws, potentially overruling those laws and resulting in fines to be paid by taxpayers. The provisions are becoming common in some trade deals between other nations.Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has warned that it would undermine U.S. sovereignty.Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions has also raised a concern about another phase in the legislation,  living agreement.  He and other experts say that phrase means that the treaty can be changed after Congress approves it.The Asia trade deal would be up first if Congress OK s the pending Trade Promotion Authority, which fast-tracks trade agreements. Levin said it is in trouble over concerns about the secret TPP.Is anyone else feeling exhausted by watching Josh  the liar  Earnest explain the corrupt Obama administration?At a media breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, Levin appeared with Jeffrey Sachs, prominent international economist at Columbia University, who panned the provision as a bid by foreign companies to make an  end run  around tough U.S. laws and regulations. Essentially, ISDS allows companies to sue states in a special ad hoc tribunal that is outside the court systems and outside of the legal systems of the host countries,  he warned.  U.S. law, U.S. court findings, could be set aside by this ad hoc process really designed and pushed by the corporate sector which sees this as an end run around national law,  he added.Levin also joined in Sessions  demand that the Asia trade pact be opened to the public. Currently, it is being kept in secret and only those cleared to see it are allowed to. Levin said, for example, that he was barred from discussing some TPP provision with Sachs.The White House has dismissed the secrecy claims, but Sachs said,  It is secret. I haven t seen it. I can t see it. Levin also said that the treaty would include communist Vietnam which has far different worker rights laws than the U.S. He recalled recently meeting with a Vietnamese woman who was thrown in jail for trying to form a union.  There has to be changes,  he demanded.Via: Washington Examiner',\n",
       " 'ISTANBUL  â\\x80\\x94   When Aynur Barkin became one of roughly 40, 000 teachers purged from Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s education system after last yearâ\\x80\\x99s attempted coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, she was not immediately replaced. As a result, her   students were forced to join the third grade, tripling their original class size. â\\x80\\x9cI could pay attention to each of them one by one,â\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Barkin, 37, who was fired in February from a school west of Istanbul. â\\x80\\x9cBut their new teacher canâ\\x80\\x99t do that. â\\x80\\x9d That is one example of the administrative upheaval and chaos caused by the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s vast purge of Turkish institutions since the failed coup in  July  â\\x80\\x94   the backdrop for a referendum on Sunday to expand the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s powers. Mr. Erdoganâ\\x80\\x99s government has sought to root out any remaining dissent by targeting nearly every segment of society. It has also used the purge as cover for a crackdown on dissidents of all stripes, including leftists like Ms. Barkin. The numbers are extraordinary. The government has fired or suspended about 130, 000 people suspected of being dissidents from the public and private sectors. Most are accused of affiliations with the Gulen movement, the Islamic followers of Fethullah Gulen, the cleric accused of orchestrating the putsch. More than 8, 000 army officers, 8, 000 police officers, 5, 000 academics and 4, 000 judges and prosecutors have been forced out, according to estimates. The social cost has been significant. Watchdogs say that around 1, 200 schools, 50 hospitals and 15 universities have been closed. Affected schoolchildren have usually been able to find places in local state schools  â\\x80\\x94   but their purged parents have mostly been frozen out of the job market. Turkey has become â\\x80\\x9clike an   prison,â\\x80\\x9d said Sezgin Yurdakul, 40, who was fired from the Istanbul ferry system because his daughter attended a   school on a scholarship. Mr. Yurdakulâ\\x80\\x99s name is blacklisted on a national database, so no employer has yet dared to give him a new job. He, like thousands of other purged employees of the state, is now living off his savings. The vacuum left by people like Mr. Yurdakul has prompted many Turks to question which individuals are permitted to fill the void  â\\x80\\x94   and which factions, if any, have benefited. Mr. Erdoganâ\\x80\\x99s allies argue that a wide range of groups has filled the void. But some claim that the gaps have been largely plugged by members of other Islamic orders, or loyalists from the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s Justice and Development Party, known as the A. K. P. â\\x80\\x9cThe A. K. P. â\\x80\\x99s own cadres are filling the void,â\\x80\\x9d said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the largest opposition party. â\\x80\\x9cThey want to establish a bureaucratic structure that accepts whatever the politicians say. â\\x80\\x9d Mustafa Karadag, the head of the judgesâ\\x80\\x99 union, says that gaps in the judiciary have often been filled by novices who can provide letters of accreditation from a legal guild with links to the A. K. P. â\\x80\\x9cThis has allowed access to the judicial and prosecutorial professions to those who receive lower marks but who have a closer relationship to the government, or who are able to procure references from them,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Karadag said. The government denies this. Ibrahim Kalin, the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s official spokesman, said in a recent briefing with reporters that those let go had been â\\x80\\x9creplaced by ordinary peopleâ\\x80\\x9d who had â\\x80\\x9call gone through very transparent, open examinations. â\\x80\\x9d But even some of the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s critics say the situation is too chaotic, and the purges too widespread, for one faction alone to have benefited. To fill the holes in the bureaucracy and the political sphere, some say, Mr. Erdogan has had to rely on   nationalists,   nationalists, novices and recalled retirees, as well as party loyalists and Islamists. â\\x80\\x9cThe perception among Turks is that Erdogan rules everything, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s not the case,â\\x80\\x9d said Orhan Gazi Ertekin, a judge who heads the Democratic Judicial Association, a liberal legal watchdog. â\\x80\\x9cThere are various groups, all different to each other, that previously plotted against each other, but are now in allianceâ\\x80\\x9d against the Gulenists. The most striking example may be that of Dogu Perincek, the leader of the tiny   Patriotic Party. He was jailed for plotting to overthrow Mr. Erdogan before his conviction was quashed in 2014. Upon his release, Mr. Perincek pledged to â\\x80\\x9cdemolishâ\\x80\\x9d Mr. Erdoganâ\\x80\\x99s government, which he accuses of undermining Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s secular system. Yet, in a recent interview, Mr. Perincek offered qualified approval of some of Mr. Erdoganâ\\x80\\x99s recent policies. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no reason for us to fight. We became side by side. They are now following our program,â\\x80\\x9d he said, referring to Mr. Erdoganâ\\x80\\x99s government. Mr. Erdogan also has the unlikely support of the Nationalist Movement Party, also known as the M. H. P. a   nationalist group whose votes helped him secure parliamentary backing for the referendum. In return, senior officials with the nationalist group privately say, they expect cabinet seats after the referendum. If they get what they want, it would constitute an unlikely   for a party whose leader once called Mr. Erdogan a â\\x80\\x9cpolitical disaster. â\\x80\\x9d In the military, the firings of thousands of officers have led to no obvious ideological victor. Mr. Erdogan raised eyebrows with the appointment last August of Adnan Tanriverdi, a former   general, as his new military adviser. Mr. Tanriverdi was expelled from the army in 1996 because of concerns over his religiosity. He has since run a group for other soldiers fired for similar reasons in the late 1990s, known as the Association of Justice Defenders. His appointment as Mr. Erdoganâ\\x80\\x99s adviser prompted claims that the president had enlisted Mr. Tanriverdi to help install loyalists in the army. But Mr. Tanriverdiâ\\x80\\x99s allies said that no other members of his association had been appointed to positions of significance. Other observers have concluded that a mix of factions has benefited from the purge of the military.   ultranationalists  â\\x80\\x94   known as Eurasianists and sometimes associated with Mr. Perincek  â\\x80\\x94   have profited at the expense of   officers, according to two military experts at Sabanci University in Istanbul. â\\x80\\x9cIt seems for now that the Eurasianists will hold on to their influence and ranks, but for how long remains a question,â\\x80\\x9d Megan Gisclon and Metin Gurcan, a former officer in the Turkish special forces, wrote in a briefing last year. One former military prosecutor says such was the scale of undercover Gulenistsâ\\x80\\x99 infiltration over the last two decades that they are still the largest faction in the armed forces. â\\x80\\x9cIn the Turkish armed forces,â\\x80\\x9d said Ahmet Zeki Ucok, who once led investigations into Gulenists in the military, â\\x80\\x9cif there is a group that currently is influential, itâ\\x80\\x99s still the Gulenists. â\\x80\\x9d In some parts of higher education, the vacuum has not been filled. At Ankara University, half of the 14 professors in the universityâ\\x80\\x99s human rights law department have been let go, and it has had to scrap more than half its courses. It will not admit new students during the next academic year. The remaining professors have had to triple the number of students in their care, and they have no ability to supervise new arrivals. â\\x80\\x9cHow can we write our dissertations?â\\x80\\x9d asked Emine Ay, a masterâ\\x80\\x99s student who has been left without a supervisor. Her department head, Prof. Kerem Altiparmak, said: â\\x80\\x9cIf our professors are not reinstated, this program will end. These are the last students we will see in this program. â\\x80\\x9d Some wonder if this, in fact, is the goal: to dismantle one of the countryâ\\x80\\x99s liberal strongholds. In the judiciary, the number purged is   of Turkeyâ\\x80\\x99s 12, 000 judges and prosecutors. â\\x80\\x9cIf you purge 30 to 40 percent of the judiciary, in a sense you purge it all,â\\x80\\x9d Judge Ertekin said. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no tradition left and no knowledge left. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Karadag, the head of the judgesâ\\x80\\x99 union, said the government was filling the vacancies with loyalists. Some say the situation is dangerous for Mr. Erdogan because it leaves him vulnerable to groups beyond his control, just as his relationship with the Gulenist network once did. â\\x80\\x9cAs long as he depends on these alliances,â\\x80\\x9d Judge Ertekin said, â\\x80\\x9ca new betrayal may be on the horizon, too. â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Erdoganâ\\x80\\x99s newfound allies in Parliament, the M. H. P. offer a glimpse of this vulnerability. While the partyâ\\x80\\x99s leadership supports expanding the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s powers, several of its lawmakers do not. Many in the partyâ\\x80\\x99s ultranationalist rank and file also have yet to be convinced. In the case of Mr. Perincek, the leader of the   party, his support for Mr. Erdogan goes only so far. While he applauds the presidentâ\\x80\\x99s recent     policies, he says the president has eroded the countryâ\\x80\\x99s secular character. Significantly, he also vehemently opposes the expansion of Mr. Erdoganâ\\x80\\x99s powers, and therefore opposes the referendum. â\\x80\\x9cTurkey,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Perincek said, â\\x80\\x9cis not going to carry Tayyip Erdogan on its shoulders. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

Jim Himes (@jahimes) March 4, 2017It s not just Democrats. GOP Sen. Ben Sasse said on Saturday that Trump owes the public a further explanation of his bizarre allegation against Obama. The president today made some very serious allegations, and the informed citizens that a republic requires deserve more information,  Sasse said, according to Politico.  If without [an authorization], the President should explain what sort of wiretap it was and how he knows this. It is possible that he was illegally tapped. But Sasse added that there are legalities to a wiretap. If it was with a legal FISA court order, then an application for surveillance exists that the court found credible. The president should ask that this full application regarding surveillance of foreign operatives or operations be made available, ideally to the full public, and at a bare minimum to the U.S. Senate,  Sasse said.Maybe if Trump released his tax returns, we could learn more.

       " 'VIENNA (Reuters) - The OSCE media watchdog on Wednesday criticized a German law designed to fine social media networks for dragging their feet in removing hateful postings for being too broad and called on lawmakers to consider amending it. The German parliament in June approved legislation, in force since the beginning of the month, that allows authorities to punish groups such as Facebook or Twitter if they do not promptly delete hate postings.     Harlem Desire, the media freedom chief of the 57-state Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, said he hoped the German law would encourage providers to speedily process users  complaints, but added its effects could be excessively restrictive.  I appeal to the German authorities to take steps to ensure the careful implementation of the law, evaluate its effects and be ready to amend it in parliament, if necessary, as in its current form, the law may have a chilling effect on freedom of expression,  Desire said in a statement.  According to the law s provisions, decisions to remove content considered unlawful or illegitimate from social networks rests with the operators of those networks, who may remove more than is necessary or proportionate, and the list of offences for which content may be deleted is very broad.  Germany has some of the world s toughest laws covering defamation, public incitement to commit crimes and threats of violence, with prison sentences for Holocaust denial or inciting hatred against minorities. However, few online cases are prosecuted. The new law gives social media networks 24 hours to delete or block obviously criminal content and seven days to deal with less clear-cut cases, with an obligation to report back to the person who filed the complaint about how they handled the case. Failure to comply could see a company fined up to 50 million euros ($59 million), and the company s chief representative in Germany fined up to 5 million euros. Critics of a new hate speech law in Germany are optimistic that it can be revised after its Social Democratic sponsors vowed to drop out of the ruling coalition following last month s national election and go into opposition.

       " 'Chuck Norris wrote about Jade Helm 15 in a commentary for the conservative website WND last weekend, pointing to the decision of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to have the Texas State Guard monitor the Pentagon s Jade Helm 15 military ops as evidence that the operations as a potential threat to the state s sovereignty.  Governor Abbott wrote:  During the training operation, it is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed.  And Abbott is demanding  regular updates on the progress and safety of the Operation. Norris fanned the conspiracy flames by writing:  Concerned Texans and Americans are in no way calling into question our brave and courageous men and women in uniform. They are merely following orders. What s under question are those who are pulling the strings at the top of Jade Helm 15 back in Washington. The US government says,  It s just a training exercise.  But I m not sure the term  just  has any reference to reality when the government uses it. A covert training operation by U.S. military special operations personnel, Jade Helm 15, is taking place in a several states this summer, spreading panic and conspiracy theories as to the true purpose of the mission.The two-month simulation spans much of the Southwest, requiring special forces from four branches of the military to carry out covert operations amid  hostile  territory in Texas, Utah and part of California.In at least one of those states, hostility toward the operation has begun a few months early. Online and at in-person meetings, many Texans have expressed suspicion and outright opposition to the project. Some are understandably worried about how it ll affect their daily lives, while conspiracy theorists claim it s an attempt to institute martial law.The military says that they are merely preforming training exercises to help hone soldiers  skills in the event they face a foreign threat, but some citizens are worried that planners have something more domestic in mind.Events for the exercise are outlined in a map among unclassified documents posted online last month. Army sources have verified to The Washington Post that the map is legitimate.Many have speculated that the American government isn t far from declaring martial law, an idea only bolstered by these training exercises.In an anonymous email sent to Dave Hodges at The Common Sense Show, a self-described Texas Ranger said that train cars outfitted with prison-type shackles have been moving about Texas. While he added that the Department of Homeland Security claimed the train cars were for transporting captured terrorists, he was apparently reluctant to believe them. He wrote: We have been told by Homeland that these trains are slated for transporting captured terrorists, non-domestic. We are not sure we can trust this explanation because Homeland is keeping a lot from us and we are growing increasingly uncomfortable with their presence in Texas.  The paranoia about Jade Helm, which started on websites like Alex Jones s InfoWars, had started with familiar fulmination about a mass seizure of firearms or a cover-up for American  death squads. This week, Texas Governor Greg Abbott asked the Texas state guard to monitor the exercise for any violations of freedom.  It is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed,  said the governor.Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said Saturday that he d been hearing concerns about Jade Helm 15, and reached out to the Pentagon for answers. My office has reached out to the Pentagon to inquire about this exercise. We are assured it is a military training exercise. I have no reason to doubt those assurances, but I understand the reason for concern and uncertainty, because when the federal government has not demonstrated itself to be trustworthy in this administration, the natural consequence is that many citizens don t trust what it is saying.  The Texas Senator, speaking at the South Carolina Republican Convention went on to say: I understand a lot of the concerns raised by a lot of citizens about Jade Helm. And I think part of the reason is we have seen, for six years, a federal government disrespecting the liberty of the citizens. That produces fear, when you see a government that is attacking our free speech rights, or Second Amendment rights, or religious liberty rights. That produces distrust.   Just because you re paranoid,  said Cruz,  doesn t mean they re not out to get you. Via: TPNN',\n",
       " \"A little over 100 days into America s experiment in dystopian rule took a predictably sad turn: The Trump administration, apparently tired of allowing people to watch non-propaganda, have begun ordering government agencies to only allow Fox News to be played in government buildings. Fox News, of course, has operated as little more than a full-time state news agency for the Trump administration.The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), operating within the FDA, was given this message after employees asked why all of their monitors had inexplicably been changed to Fox News:I wanted to let everyone know that the reason for the change from CNN to FOX.The reason for the change is that a decision from the current administration adminstrative officials has requested that all monitors, under our control, on the White Oak Campus, display FOX news.Sorry for the inconvenience, but I am unable to change any of the monitors to any other news source at this time.Reporter Julia Reinstein confirmed the email from a source within the research center.Someone at CBER sent me the email which told staff TVs had been switched to Fox News by order of the admin pic.twitter.com/rsCzpOtdpv  Julia Reinstein (@juliareinstein) May 5, 2017Reinstein got a picture confirming that the TVs within an office filled with serious scientists and researchers trying to do their jobs really were streaming Fox News.Here's Fox News on the TVs at CBER, same day an email went out to staff saying it had been switched from CNN to Fox by order of Trump admin pic.twitter.com/uVPx8jekIk  Julia Reinstein (@juliareinstein) May 5, 2017Fox News has weathered its own scandals recently by doubling, then tripling down on unwavering support of Donald Trump. Its years of anti-Obama hysterics have given way to a Trump promotional operation that is breathtaking to watch. The mental gymnastics the network pulls in order to defend Trump s (largely unsuccessful) first 100 days has become the stuff of legend, including what may be one of the most unintentionally hilarious tweets ever published.Jobless rate after first 3 months: Trump vs. Obama vs. Bush vs. Clinton. pic.twitter.com/EUTEseJyTj  Fox News (@FoxNews) April 29, 2017Unsurprisingly, all of this favorable coverage has pleased Trump, who is reportedly obsessed with what people are saying about him on cable news.

       " 'This is the best explanation of why Obama and the Democrat party are fighting so hard to keep the US State Department s Refugee Resettlement program going strong.  Please share this with everyone who s been wondering why the Democrats are so eager to bring Muslim immigrants from countries who hate us, to America, while leaving Christian refugees from the same countries behind. To hell with terrorism, the Democrats want to win even if it s at the expense of our national security Looks like my old stomping grounds in Montana are heating up. People there are not taking Obama s plan to force refugees on them lying down. There was a protest in Missoula, Montana recently over that very issue. It is just one of many battles brewing out there in small town America.Small towns in the sparsely populated parts of America are the perfect place to relocate these refugees. Especially, if your agenda includes politically terraforming the country. The West is historically conservative in their politics. Many are Republicans and Libertarians. Even the Democrats hearken back to an earlier time when they were more conservative in nature. Obama and the Democrats can t have that. They need to have an entire country willing to submit to Marxist diktats. They need areas seeded with those who will vote Democrat and ensure that they stay in power no matter what.And it s not just voting demographics that are pushing this move either. I personally believe that there is a warped logic to all of this. That if Islam can be made the predominant religion in America, people will be more easily controlled. That s insane of course and won t work, but there you have it. Instead, Shariah law will be implemented and you will see the same atrocities occurring in Europe happen here. The big difference being, that at least for now, Americans are armed and will use those weapons to protect their neighbors, loved ones and country.Of the 237 Syrian refugees admitted to the U.S. since the attacks in Paris just one has been a Christian. The rest have been Muslims.CNS News reports that according to data from the State Department Refugee Processing Center, since the November 13 attacks the U.S. has admitted 236 Sunni Muslim refugees from Syria and a single Christian   a Greek Orthodox refugee.Bringing in the refugees also moves forward the Cloward and Piven strategy to overwhelm the system so it will collapse and cause chaos in the streets. These people want to tear the system apart, so they can replace it with something truly heinous. The Obama administration will never admit that this is the plan, but can you honestly look at what is going on today and tell me it isn t? Our borders are wide open. We are not vetting anyone to speak of and security here in the US is worse than before 9/11.Communities in states such as Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and Kansas are being infused with Muslim refugees even though they are not wanted by the residents or the local law enforcement. The feds and their leaders are not giving them a choice. Wyoming is the only state currently not participating in the program, but even the governor there wants to jump in it. Living in large cities would be too costly for the refugees and more can be accomplished with seeding them across the plains. In a small town, they can turn everything to their advantage in short order. Since many of our larger cities are already flooded with immigrants from south of the border and from Muslim nations, in many respects they have at least partially fallen to the ploy already. This is the fundamental transformation of America in play. South Carolina, Idaho, Minnesota, North Dakota and Michigan are vigorously fighting against this program and Obama s  change .The same entitlements, jobs, lodging and freebies will be given to these refugees in small town America. But that will mean taking more and more away from locals in these same communities. These immigrants bring crime and disease with them. As crime rises, people will leave which will hasten the take over of these towns. At least that is what Obama and his friends hope for. I pray that people dig in and decide to stay and fight if they can.We haven t learned a damned thing from watching what is going on over in Europe. How do you justify the rapefugees in Germany and Sweden, who treat rape as game for a large number of players at a given event? How can you ignore the violence, the murders, the depravity that is the Ummah? What s wrong with these people? Do money and power mean so much to them that they don t care that they are selling America out to a hellish nightmare movement? Imagine your wives, daughters, mothers, neighbors  little children  subjected to these beasts. What would you do?For entire story: Trevor Loudon ',\n",

       " 'ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday called the Iraqi Kurdish independence referendum illegitimate and said Russia and Turkey agreed that the territorial integrity of Iraq and neighboring Syria must be preserved. Erdogan spoke after face-to-face talks in Ankara with President Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader gave no opinion of the vote, saying Moscow s position had been set out by the foreign ministry which said it respected the Kurds   national striving  but supported the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. Both Turkey and Russia have strong commercial ties with the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of north Iraq but Turkey - with a large Kurdish population of its own - bitterly criticized Monday s referendum, threatening economic sanctions and a military response.  The Kurdish referendum has no legitimacy in terms of the Iraqi constitution and international laws,  Erdogan said in his comments at the presidential palace.   No one has the right to throw our region in the fire. In this delicate period after the referendum, we have to prevent the Kurdish Regional Government from making bigger mistakes.  Turkey has been battling an insurgency in its mainly Kurdish southeast for more than three decades and fears the vote in northern Iraq could fuel separatism within its own borders. Both Erdogan and Putin said they would continue to work together to address the conflict in Syria, where they have supported opposing sides in the struggle between President Bashar al-Assad s government and rebels who fought to overthrow him.  The de facto conditions for ending the fratricidal war in Syria, the final destruction of terrorists and Syrians  return to a normal life have been created,  said Putin, whose support for Assad helped turn the tide of the six-year conflict in favor of the president. Putin said he and Erdogan confirmed their commitment to four  de-escalation zones  across Syria, including the northwestern province of Idlib, home to about 2 million people and largely controlled by former Nusra Front militants. Erdogan said last week that Turkish troops will deploy inside Idlib, which is on Turkey s southern border, while Russia would maintain security outside the province. Warplanes conducted a tenth consecutive day of air strikes on the Idlib area on Thursday, targeting insurgent-held towns, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Opposition rescue workers said on Wednesday that Russian and Syrian jets had killed at least 150 civilians in the air raids. Russia says it is only attacking jihadists. Russian media, citing the defense ministry, said 37 Nusra members including five field commanders were killed in a rocket attack in Idlib. The presidents said they wanted to see progress in two major projects, the TurkStream gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey and the Akkuyu nuclear power plant being built in Turkey with Russian collaboration.  We place great importance on the realization of these projects swiftly,  Erdogan said.  We have observed during out talks that there are some disruptions, we will fix them quickly.  ',\n",
       " 'Rasmussen Polling wrote a commentary last year outlining ten factors that will determine who the next president will be. Among those was, of course, the candidates themselves and their rung mates, the state of the economy, the ongoing culture wars, and how vigorously the candidates fight in swing states. But one factor, which seems to have an influential and historical trend in elections, is the current president s approval rating. As Rasmussen found:Postwar history suggests that when a president has weak approval, his party pays a price in the next election. Harry Truman (1952), Lyndon Johnson (1968), Gerald Ford (1976), Jimmy Carter (1980), George H.W. Bush (1992), and George W. Bush (2008) all had mediocre-to-poor approval ratings, and the opposing party won all of those elections (defeating incumbents Ford, Carter, and H.W. Bush, and winning open-seat races in the others).When President Obama was elected in November 2008, George W. Bush s approval rating was a dismal 19 percent. In July 1992, when George H.W Bush was campaigning against Bill Clinton, his approval rating fell to a record low 29 percent.Well if this is a precedential factor that helps determine who the president will be, Democrats should be breathing a sigh of relief.A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows President Obama s approval rating is 51 percent, while his disapproval rating is 46 percent. The last time President Obama had the majority of approval from the country (in this poll), was during his second inauguration in January 2013.The numbers, NBC shows, could be beneficial to Hillary Clinton:The president s relative political strength could be a significant boon for Hillary Clinton, whose 2016 candidacy is largely focused on preserving key aspects of his Democratic policy-making.The poll shows that Clinton, despite her own high negative ratings as an individual candidate, could enjoy some other structural advantages as well in the 2016 contestAstoundingly, 54 percent of Independents (remember, President Obama lost Independents in 2012) approve of the job he s doing.That s good news for Democrats, who are relying on a large turnout of Independent voters to counter Donald Trump s right-wing populism.Similarly, Gallup Polling shows the president s approval rating stands at 52 percent, up two points from the previous week. The last time President Obama had an approval rating of 52 percent (according to their polling), was in February 2013.This is good news for Democrats. Clinton, who is well on the way of becoming the nominee, has made continuing the Obama legacy a staple in her campaign. That resounds well with Democrats and apparently should with Independents.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'PARIS/SEOUL (Reuters) - France s Winter Olympics team will not travel to the 2018 Games in South Korea if its security cannot be guaranteed, France s sports minister said on Thursday, the first major doubts by a participating nation about growing North Korean tensions. The games organizer said on Friday that it is closely monitoring the current geopolitical situation with the South Korean government, adding that safety is the top priority. Tensions in the region have escalated since North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3, prompting global condemnation. North Korea s leader Kim Jong Un said on Friday the North will consider the  highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history  against the United States in response to U.S. President Donald Trump s threat to destroy the North. France s Sports Minister Laura Flessel told RTL radio that if the crisis deepened and  our security cannot be assured, the French Olympics team will stay at home.   But she added:  We re not there yet.  Participants in the Games - the first Winter Olympics hosted by an Asian nation outside Japan - had not previously raised safety concerns publicly. The games are scheduled for Feb 9-25 next year in Pyeongchang, just 80 km (50 miles) from the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, the world s most heavily armed border. The two countries remain technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty.  Safety and security is one of the most important aspects of Games preparations,  Sung Baik-you, a spokesman for the organizing committee, said in a statement to Reuters on Friday. South Korea s President Moon Jae-in said on Wednesday the country is pushing to ensure security at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. In a meeting with International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach, Moon said South Korea is well aware of the concerns. The Japanese Olympic Committee said on Friday it is not considering the cancellation of its plans.  We will continue to prepare in the same way as with other international competitions that we take part in,  a spokeswoman for the committee said. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) said it was working with all the relevant authorities to ensure its athletes would be safe.  Each host city presents a unique challenge from a security perspective, and, as is always the case, we are working with the organizers, the U.S. State Department and the relevant law enforcement agencies to ensure that our athletes, and our entire delegation, are safe,  USOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky said. The Chinese Olympic Committee said it had no immediate comment. The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC), which has representatives in South Korea, said the safety of its team was always its main priority.  The safety of our entire Canadian Olympic Team is always our main priority, no matter where the Games are held,  the COC said in a statement emailed to Reuters.  The Government of Canada does not currently have travel advisories in place for South Korea and recommends that Canadians exercise normal security precautions, which is the lowest of four risk levels.  Australia, one of Asia s largest participants at recent Winter Games, is monitoring the situation.  The safety of our team is of the highest priority but we are comfortable with the priority that the (International Olympic Committee) and the Org Comm are placing on security and safety of the Games and its participants,  the Australian Olympic Committee said in a statement emailed to Reuters.  We are relying on advice from DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) and working with the Korean Ambassador and if their advice changes, we will advise our team accordingly but for the moment there is no suggestion that the Games will not go ahead or their safety is compromised.  The chief of the International Ski Federation, Gian-Franco Kasper, dismissed any fears among athletes, saying the Pyeongchang Olympics would be the  safest in the world .

       " 'PARIS (Reuters) - European Parliament President Martin Schulz said on Saturday that neither Europe nor the United States was prepared for a Donald Trump presidency as the likely Republican candidate had no international experience and was a populist. â\\x80\\x9cTrump belongs to these people that we also have here in Europe, who have a scapegoat for all issues but never have a concrete solution,â\\x80\\x9d Schulz told French television i-Tele. â\\x80\\x9cHonestly, I prefer another candidate,â\\x80\\x9d he said, referring to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. Secretary of State.  Schulz, a German Social Democrat, is president â\\x80\\x94 or speaker â\\x80\\x94 of the European Unionâ\\x80\\x99s directly elected parliament, whose 751 members have the power to approve, amend or reject legislation affecting the whole 28-country bloc.  Billionaire Trump has a significant lead in primary contests for the Republican nomination for Novemberâ\\x80\\x99s election to the White House. He has drawn fervent support as well as harsh criticism for his calls to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and to impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. A Trump rally scheduled for Friday night in Chicago was canceled after the event turned into a chaotic scene, with thousands of attendees split into opposing camps of his supporters and protesters inflamed by his candidacy.

Hamida, her husband Nasir Ahmed and their two young sons were among 18 refugees on a small fishing boat crossing the Bay of Bengal to the Bangladesh village of Shah Porir Dwip.  As they neared the shore, the boat capsized and they were tossed into the murky water. Reuters photographer Mohammad Ponir Hossain was taking pictures of exhausted refugees on the beach when he heard an autorickshaw driver shouting that a boat had capsized.  I rushed to the spot and found people crying over the dead body of a child,  Ponir said. Click here for a photo essay - reut.rs/2wfJOUr He took a picture of Hamida, cradling the tiny pale body of her child, Abdul Masood. He appears to have died as the survivors scrambled through the crashing waves to shore. Another picture showed the anguish on the face of Nasir Ahmed as he carried his son away from the crowd. The couple s other son survived the accident. Around 400,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh in less than three weeks and people are still arriving, by land and sea, after attacks by Rohingya militants sparked a fierce counteroffensive by Myanmar s army.  Senior United Nations officials have described the violence as a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing . Hamida s family was among tens of thousands of Rohingya who embarked in a rickety fleet of small wooden fishing boats on the crossing from Myanmar s coast to southern Bangladesh, a journey that can take up to five hours.  They are so desperate that they are risking their lives to escape Myanmar. The pictures show what is going on here,  Ponir said. ',\n",

       " '\\nZero Hedge \\nThe UN is a joke! \\nYesterday, for the first time since 2006, Russia failed to be re-elected for a spot on the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) - which until July was chaired by none other than Saudi Arabia - after being narrowly beaten by Croatia in a vote. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia was successfully re-elected, despite vocal criticism from human rights organizations. The 47 places on the council are distributed on a regional basis, with staggered elections seeing a third of the body re-elected each year. Russia had finished its three-year term, and was running against Hungary and Croatia for the two available seats from Eastern Europe. \\nThe decision was close, and came down to just two votes: with Hungary far ahead, Croatia received the votes of 114 of the 193 member countries, and Russia was selected on 112 ballots. \\n\"It was a very close vote and very good countries competing, Croatia, Hungary. They are fortunate because of their size, they are not exposed to the winds of international diplomacy. Russia is very exposed. We\\'ve been in the UNHRC for several years, and I am sure next time we will stand and get back in,\" Russia\\'s UN envoy Vitaly Churkin said quoted by RT . Russia is eligible to run next year, against a new set of countries. \\nAhead of this yearâ\\x80\\x99s vote Russia came under concerted pressure from human rights organizations. â\\x80\\x9cThe non-election of Russia shows that the nations of the world can reject gross abusers if they so choose,â\\x80\\x9d said executive director Hillel Neuer. â\\x80\\x9cThis makes the election of Saudi Arabia, China and Cuba even more preposterous.â\\x80\\x9d \\nAs we reported earlier this week , a petition signed by 80 NGOs, including Human Rights Watch and Refugees International, asked the voting countries to \"question seriously whether Russia\\'s role in Syria which includes supporting and undertaking military actions which have routinely targeted civilians and civilian objects renders it fit to serve on the UN\\'s premier inter-governmental human rights institution.\" Russia dismissed the petition, published this week, as â\\x80\\x9ccynicalâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cdishonorable,â\\x80\\x9d and said the accusations were motivated more by politics than by concern for human rights. Moscow, which has been conducting airstrikes in the country over the past year, says that it is acting legally, following an official call for assistance from the Syrian government, and insists that its war efforts are targeted at terrorists. \\nHowever, most perversely, in what was clearly a politically-motivated choice, Saudi Arabia sailed through the Asian regional ballot with 152 votes, and will sit on the UNHRC alongside China, Japan and Iraq for the next three years.

       " '21st Century Wire says The intelligence agencies of the US and the UK were chartered to serve the government and protect national security by gathering information, analyzing data and making recommendations to government officials. At least that is how it was sold to the public in the beginning.But what do we see now? We see intelligence agencies in both the US and the UK being used to serve as a political sledge hammer in the realms of foreign policy, media subversion, disinformation operations, regime change, assassination, domestic wiretapping, full spectrum surveillance and all things dirty in the political black bag of tricks. The report below raises some major questions that citizens of the US and UK should be asking themselves about their intelligence services.Are the CIA and MI6 protecting national security at all anymore?Why are these intelligence agencies actively involved in the creation and dispersal of false documents and reports?Is their end game to subvert the inauguration a democratically elected government official in the United States?Who is cheering on these intelligence agencies?Will Trump be victorious against the intelligence apparatus?One thing is certain: no functioning democracy can survive for long if its intelligence agencies feel they are more important than our elected officials  Consortium News Exclusive: President-elect Trump is in a nasty slugfest with U.S. intelligence agencies as they portray him as a Russian tool and he blasts their attempt to delegitimize his election, says ex-British intelligence officer Annie Machon.Annie Machon Consortium NewsThe clash between plutocratic President-elect Trump and the CIA is shaping up to be the heavyweight prize fight of the century, and Trump at least is approaching it with all the entertaining bombast of Mohammed Ali at the top of his game. Rather than following the tradition of doing dirty political deals in dark corners, more commonly known as fixing the match, Trump has come out swinging in the full glare of the media.In that corner, we have a deal-making, billionaire  man of the people  who, to European sensibilities at least, reputedly espouses some of the madder domestic obsessions and yet has seemed to offer hope to many aggrieved Americans. But it is his professed position on building a rapprochement with Russia and cooperating with Moscow to sort out the Syrian mess that caught my attention and that of many other independent commentators internationally.In the opposite corner, Trump s opponents have pushed the CIA into the ring to deliver the knock-out blow, but this has yet to land. Despite jab after jab, Trump keeps evading the blows and comes rattling back against all odds. One has to admire the guy s footwork.So who are the opponents ranged behind the CIA, yelling encouragement through the ropes? The obvious culprits include the U.S. military-industrial complex, whose corporate bottom line relies on an era of unending war. As justification for extracting billions   even trillions   of dollars from American taxpayers, there was a need for frightening villains, such as Al Qaeda and even more so, the head choppers of ISIS. However, since the Russian intervention in Syria in 2015, those villains no longer packed as scary a punch, so a more enduring villain, like Emmanuel Goldstein, the principal enemy of the state in George Orwell s 1984, was required. Russia was the obvious new choice, the old favorite from the Cold War playbook.The Western intelligence agencies have a vested interest in eternal enemies to ensure both eternal funding and eternal power, hence the CIA s entry into the fight. As former British MP and long-time peace activist George Galloway so eloquently said in a recent interview, an unholy alliance is now being formed between the  war party  in the U.S., the military-industrial-intelligence complex and those who would have previously publicly spurned such accomplices: American progressives and their traditional host, the Democratic Party.Yet, if the Democratic National Committee had not done its best to rig the primaries in favor of Hillary Clinton, then perhaps we would not be in this position. Bernie Sanders would be the President-elect.Two-Party ShamThese establishment forces have also revealed to the wider world a fact long known but largely dismissed as conspiracy theory by the corporate mainstream media, that the two-party system in both the U.S. and the U.K. is a sham. In fact, we are governed by a globalized elite, working in its own interest while ignoring ours. The Democrats, openly disgruntled by Hillary Clinton s election loss and being seen to jump into bed so quickly with the spooks and the warmongers, have laid this reality bare.In fact, respected U.S. investigative journalist Robert Parry recently wrote that an intelligence contact told him before the election that the intelligence agencies did not like either of the presidential candidates. This may go some way to explaining the FBI s intervention in the run-up to the election against Hillary Clinton, as well as the CIA s attempts to de-legitimize Trump s victory afterwards.Whether that was indeed the case, the CIA has certainly held back no punches since Trump s election. First the evidence-lite assertion that it was the Russians who hacked the DNC emails and leaked them to WikiLeaks: then the fake news about Russia hacking the voting computers; that then morphed into the Russians  hacked the election  itself; then they  hacked  into the U.S. electric grid via a Vermont utility.  All this without a shred of fact-based evidence provided, but Obama s expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats last month solidified this dubious reality in Americans  minds.All this culminated in the  dirty dossier  allegations last week about Trump, which he has rightly knocked down   it was desperately poor stuff.This last item, from a British perspective, is particularly concerning. It appears that a Washington dirt-digging company was hired by a Republican rival to Trump to unearth any potential Russian scandals during the primaries; once Trump had won the nomination this dirt-digging operation was taken over by a Democrat supporter of Hillary Clinton. The anti-Trump investigation was then sub-contracted to an alleged ex-British spy, an ex-MI6 man named Christopher Steele.The Role of MI6Much has already been written about Steele and the company, much of it contradictory as no doubt befits the life of a former spy. But it is a standard career trajectory for insiders to move on to corporate, mercenary spy companies, and this is what Steele appears to have done successfully in 2009. Of course, much is predicated on maintaining good working relations with your former employers.That is the aspect that interests me most   how close a linkage did he indeed retain with his former employers after he left MI6 in 2009 to set up his own private spy company? The answer is important because companies such has his can also be used as cut-outs for  plausible deniability  by official state spies.I m not suggesting that happened in this case, but Steele reportedly remained on good terms with MI6 and was well thought of. For a man who had not been stationed in Russia for over 20 years, it would perhaps have been natural for him to turn to old chums for useful connections.But this question is of extreme importance at a critical juncture for the U.K.; if indeed MI6 was complicit or even aware of this dirt digging, as it seems to have been, then that is a huge diplomatic problem for the government s attempts to develop a strong working relationship with the US, post-Brexit. If MI6 s sticky fingers were on this case, then the organization has done the precise opposite of its official task    to protect national security and the economic well-being of the UK. MI6 and its U.S. intelligence chums need to remember their designated and legislated roles within a democracy   to serve the government and protect national security by gathering intelligence, assessing it impartially and making recommendations on which the government of the day will choose to act or not as the case may be.The spies are not there to fake intelligence to suit the agenda of a particular regime, as happened in the run-up to the illegal Iraq War, nor are they there to endemically spy on their own populations (and the rest of the world, as we know post-Snowden) in a pointless hunt for subversive activity, which often translates into legitimate political activism and acts of individual expression).And most especially the intelligence agencies should not be trying to subvert democratically elected governments. And yet this is what the CIA and a former senior MI6 officer, along with their powerful political allies, appear to be now attempting against Trump.Chances for PeaceIf I were an American, I would be wary of many of Trump s domestic policies. As a European concerned with greater peace rather than increasing war, I can only applaud his constructive approach towards Russia and his offer to cooperate with Moscow to stanch the bloodshed in the Middle East.That, of course, may be the nub of his fight with the CIA and other vested interests who want Russia as the new bogeyman. But I would bet that Trump takes the CIA s slurs personally. After all, given the ugliness of the accusations and the lack of proof, who would not?So, this is a world championship heavy-weight fight over who gets to hold office and wield power, an area where the U.S. and U.K. intelligence agencies have considerable experience in rigging matches and knocking out opponents. Think, for instance, Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq in 1953; Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1973; Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in 2003; and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

       " '3454 Views November 07, 2016 15 Comments Guest Posts The Saker \\nby Oleg Maslov \\nThe time has come for the country with the largest economy and military in the world will soon go to the polls to choose a new leader for itself. Americans will elect a new president on November 8, 2016. However, the two main candidates running for the office of president in the general election have never been more different from each other. Hillary Clinton has lived in the White House as First Lady for 8 years, served as a senator, ran for president in 2008, and served as Secretary of State during Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s first term, during which she oversaw the NATO intervention in Libya and the Benghazi crisis â\\x80\\x93 in other words, a career politician. On the other hand, Donald Trump has never served in public office, instead dedicating his life to many different business ventures, some of which became runaway successes and others short-lived failures. \\nBoth candidates boast considerable strengths and face off against damaging scandals. Clinton has been touted as the â\\x80\\x98most qualified candidate for the jobâ\\x80\\x99 and has decades of experience in and around the center of power in Washington. However, she is currently under investigation by the FBI for potentially mishandling classified information after using a private email server to send and receive emails while Secretary of State, faced allegations of corruption relating to donations from foreign entities to the Clinton Foundation in return for political favors, responded to leaked email suggested that the Democratic National Convention colluded with major media companies against Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders, and dealt with ongoing accusations of husband Bill Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s sexual relations and infidelities. On the other hand, Trump has pointed to his wealth to promote himself as a self-made billionaire capable of hard negotiations and used his status as a political outsider status to make his promise to change to the establishment believable. He has also been the target of sexual harassment allegations, responded to claims that some of his failed businesses may have been scams, battled accusations of involvement with white supremacy groups, and is the only candidate for president from a major party not to release tax information since Gerald Ford. \\nComparing the individual factors and history of both candidates gives us considerable information for analysis, but what effect will the policies of the candidates bring to the world once they enter office? In the following sections, we pit Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in a head-to-head comparison, analyzing the likely outcomes of their policies on global conflicts, the world economy, American social and business conditions, the future of Europe, and US relations with Russia and China. \\nGlobal Conflicts \\nHillary Clinton \\nThe former Secretary of State has been labeled by some analysts as a representative of the â\\x80\\x98hawksâ\\x80\\x99 in Washington, or the group of influencers who are pro-war and closely connected with the American military industrial complex. Hillary Clinton voted for the American interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Senator and spearheaded the American push for the NATO-imposed â\\x80\\x98no-fly zoneâ\\x80\\x99 in Libya as well as the US support for â\\x80\\x98moderate rebelsâ\\x80\\x99 in Syria as Secretary of State in the Obama administration. \\nA vote for Hillary is a vote for continuing the foreign policies of the Obama administration, including the expansion of NATO activities in Eastern Europe, intensifying American actions against the government of Bashar al-Assad, ramping up US naval might in the South China Sea, and arming and supporting Saudi Arabia in its military operation against Yemen. \\nOne policy favored by Hillary Clinton adequately sums up the potential effects of a Clinton administration on global security: Hillary Clinton has publicly advocated for the implementation of a â\\x80\\x98no-fly zoneâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98safe zonesâ\\x80\\x99 within Syria. Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of State, succinctly outlined the consequences of such a policy last month when he explained to the US Senate that carrying out this policy would require the United States to â\\x80\\x9cgo to war against Syria and Russiaâ\\x80\\x9d, something unequivocally negative for both regional and global security and something which will certainly exacerbate tensions in Syria rather than relieve them. \\nTrump expresses the greatest fear that such a policy may bring when he says that such proposals may start World War III. \\nMuch can be written on the other conflicts mentioned, but the general trend is relatively apparent â\\x80\\x93 a Clinton presidency would continue aggressive American policies which only increase tensions and create the possibility for a spark to light the powder keg of conflict. \\nDonald Trump \\nIf a Clinton administration would be predictably aggressive, a Trump administration would be an unpredictable wild card for global security. Many point to Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s open call for good relations between the US and Russia, even for cooperation between the two countries in tackling the Islamic State, as a sign of a period of peace and stabilization of the global security climate under a Trump administration. However, others react with alarm when they hear Trump criticize the usefulness of NATO or seemingly advocate for the proliferation of nuclear weapons, although these apparent Trump policies are often taken out of context. \\nTrump has consistently called for an increased â\\x80\\x98sharing of the burdenâ\\x80\\x99 from NATO partners and other American partners, notably Japan and South Korea. His campaign claims that the remarks that Trump made about the usefulness NATO and the proliferation of nuclear weapons was an extreme example meant to show the necessity of convincing American partners to pay more for the US military umbrella and that Trump has no intention of disbanding NATO or allowing states like Saudi Arabia or Japan to get nuclear weapons. \\nHowever, if Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s drive to push more of the financial burden of US military protection onto allies were to fail, he may be forced to carry out his promises, at least to some degree, if only to save face. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s public intentions to mend ties with Russia and pursue cooperation in Syria combined with the potential for a weaker US presence in Europe may in fact encourage Russia to act more aggressively in pursuing their own interests in Europe and the Middle East. \\nOne country has been disproportionately targeted by Trump â\\x80\\x93 China. Trump has campaigned on the idea that China has been playing the United States for a sucker and that the US-Chinese relationship has been beneficial mostly for one side. His promises to renegotiate trade deals with China (which could be potentially quite harmful for China) could well have to be enforced by naval power projection, and Trump may end up following many of the same naval policies in the South China Sea as the Obama administration. This would, of course, raise tensions between the United States and China. \\nTrumpâ\\x80\\x99s proposals and policies have not been thoroughly tested and their success at stabilizing the world situation are far from assured. Although Trump tends to appear more interested in fostering peace and cooling down global conflict, the tensions created by his policies, especially with respect to China, may in fact increase the possibility of conflict, showing just how unpredictable a Trump administration may be. \\nWorld Economy \\nDonald Trump \\nTrump has positioned himself as a pro-business candidate that will stimulate the US economy, and many of his proposed policies could potentially have positive effects. However, Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s heavy criticism of global trade agreements, including the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific-Partnership (TPP), as well as Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s intention to force American companies to bring their business operations back from other countries in an attempt to reverse the process of â\\x80\\x98offshorizationâ\\x80\\x99 may well benefit the American economy, but may in fact deal some heavy damage to the global economy. \\nPolicies that benefit the United States directly, such as encouraging auto manufacturers to return production to American soil by raising tariffs on autos made by American companies in other countries, will have a negative effect on other countries. Agreements such as the TTIP would certainly raise global economic activity, despite the fact that they benefit one side over the other, and would raise the level of global economic activity. It follows that delaying or disrupting negotiations on these agreements may lead to more negative consequences for the world economy as a whole. \\nTrumpâ\\x80\\x99s public call for better relations with Russia may have the effect of reducing or even removing sanctions thereby restoring former business between Russia and Europe as well as creating new business relationships which compensate for negative effects of other policies on the world economy. Further, if Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s promises for peace and stabilization of global conflicts is carried out, economic activity and innovation would continue without any obstacle. \\nHillary Clinton \\nA Clinton administration would continue to develop the economic strategy initiated by the Obama administration, including liberal policies toward corporate offshoring and advancement of global trade deals such as TTIP and TPP. In essence, these policies would produce slow but stable growth for the world economy. Maintaing the sanctions on Russia would restrict global growth but if negotiations on either TTIP or TPP would result in an agreement, the resulting economic activity would more than make up for that lost business. \\nThe Clinton administration may appear to offer better opportunities for the global economy, but one major factor still needs consideration. Clintonâ\\x80\\x99s preference for resolution of conflicts by military means, seen most acutely in her proposals for resolving the Syrian situation, have a high potential to lead to a wider conflict with Russia and Iran, and ultimately may lead to a third global war, a war in which the main adversaries have a vast amount of deliverable nuclear weapons as well as a protocol for using them, should the need arise. \\nNeedless to say, any conflict in which nuclear weapons are used is unequivocally negative for the global economy in the short term, if a global economy even remains after the dust has settled. If a global war remains conventional or if nuclear weapons are used in limited capacity, the prospect for global economic growth in the medium term is quite positive given the need to rebuild the affected countries, but the loss of life, destruction of productive infrastructure and buildings, and long term psychological and social effects far outweigh the economic growth related to rebuilding what was lost. \\nUS Social and Business Conditions \\nHillary Clinton \\nAs the status quo candidate, Hillary Clinton represents a future similar to the present conditions with small but noticeable changes. Although controversial, Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s healthcare plan, commonly referred to as â\\x80\\x98Obamacareâ\\x80\\x99, did bring healthcare insurance to more Americans. Clinton will most certainly continue developing Obamacare, which may improve the lives of many people. Hillary has also proposed a plan to finance higher education for students whose household earns a combined income of less than $125,000 per year, something seen as positive for standard of living and development of future business conditions. \\nClintonâ\\x80\\x99s willingness to accept more refugees from the war torn Middle East may increase already palpable social tensions by increasing competition for low-wage jobs and undermining social cohesion. The liberal policies of allowing companies to seek lower cost labor in other countries will continue to send jobs out of the United States, leaving university graduates, already suffering from low employment rates, with even fewer work opportunities. \\nDespite meeting with mothers of black teens killed by police, Hillary has no practical solution for addressing the growing issue of perceived racial prejudice by police officers. Neither does Donald Trump for that matter. \\nDonald Trump \\nTrumpâ\\x80\\x99s strongest potential option for improving the social and business conditions in the US is his promise to force American companies to bring production back to the United States. Fulfilling this promise would create many jobs in the US and alleviate the millennial unemployment problem, all the while raising wages and the overall standard of living. Although xenophobic and perhaps even racially charged in nature, Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s intention to limit immigration may also create more low-wage opportunities for American citizens. \\nTrump has called for an increase in paid maternity leave, something which may quality of life for average people. One of his main campaign promises is to revise and simplify the tax system. If done properly, this policy will make filing taxes easier for normal citizens and businesses as well, improving business conditions and potentially creating more jobs and economic activity. \\nOn the other hand, Trump is widely seen as a candidate who represents white male superiority and the mere fact of a Trump administration may cause an increase in already palpable social tensions, potentially even leading to open protest from Muslim or Hispanic groups among others at his presidency. The Clinton campaign has worked to paint Trump as a white supremacist and misogynist, and often successfully so. Despite the potential economic benefits of a Trump presidency, the potential explosion of social tensions may cause an overall negative social and business situation in the United States. Of course, a Trump administration will recognize this danger and will make every attempt to prevent it. \\nThe Future of Europe \\nDonald Trump \\nA Trump presidency would entail a major reversal of policies for many Eastern European countries, including the Baltic States, Poland, and Ukraine, when it comes to European relations with Russia. Trump has not only publicly questioned the utility of NATO, but has also called for better relations with Russia, both concepts which are anathema to many Eastern European nations. If Trump were to decrease the American footprint in Europe and to attempt to build better relations with Russia, many European nations would be forced to rethink some of their main strategic objectives at the very least. The current government of Ukraine would be one of the biggest losers in Europe should Trump become president and may even be pushed out of power, either peacefully or forcefully, should Trump choose to sacrifice American support for Ukraine in exchange for better relations with Russia, including recognition of Crimea as Russian territory. \\nA decrease in US forces on mainland Europe as well as American engineered political obstacles to cooperation between Europe and Russia would naturally lead to a blossoming of relations between Europe and Russia. Under a Trump presidency, one may expect a significant rollback of European sanctions on Russia and significant growth in Russia-Europe trade and relations. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Parliamentary Assembly for the Council of Europe (PACE) would regain influence in regulating Europe-Russia relations. European-Chinese relations would also grow dynamically as â\\x80\\x98Silk Roadâ\\x80\\x99 projects through Russia would take on new relevance. \\nMany so-called â\\x80\\x98Euroskepticâ\\x80\\x99 movements and otherwise â\\x80\\x98right of centerâ\\x80\\x99 political groups would gain influence and perhaps even become part of the mainstream political configuration. Parties like Marine Le Penâ\\x80\\x99s Front National, Alternative fuer Deutschland, Austriaâ\\x80\\x99s Freedom Party, and Golden Dawn in Greece could make a grand entrance into mainstream politics while ruling parties in Hungary and Italy could become even more entrenched. Pushed forward by Brexit, this trend would bring considerable momentum behind the a drive for the dissolution of the European Union, at least for the monetary union, but this remains unlikely. \\nA Trump presidency may even allow for the start of negotiations between Europe and Russia on a comprehensive trade and political agreement to regulate relations. Numerous politicians, including Francois Mitterand and Vladimir Putin, have spoken about a free trade zone stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostock, but if China has any say in the matter, the zone will extend to Singapore and cover the entire supercontinent of Eurasia. If this concept were to ever become reality, European nations would gain influence over developing nations and receive access to valuable and profitable investment opportunities. \\nFurther, any major agreement between the United States and Russia on Middle Eastern policy would entail a significant slowdown of the current migration crisis as well as a noticeable reduction in terrorist related activity. Europe may even join a coalition of the US and Russia to fight terrorism. Lastly, US missile defense systems in Poland and Romania are likely to be dismantled. \\nHillary Clinton \\nA Hillary Clinton presidency would entail business as usual with Europe and a continuation of the current trends and policies initiated by the Obama administration. The major features of a Clinton presidency would include continued military build-up in Baltic states, continuation of European sanctions against Russia, increased support for the Ukrainian government, increased media hype about the Russian military threat, and a further break-down in the systems that govern Europe-Russia relations, such as the OSCE and PACE. \\nA Clinton presidency would entail an increase in the number of American troops in mainland Europe as well as an increase in joint US-European defense projects, including expansions of the missile defense project. More US-led NATO troops, groupings, and exercises would take place in the Baltic countries and a Clinton administration would push for Sweden and Finland closer to NATO, with the ultimate purpose to convince the Scandinavian countries to join the military block. Expect increased media reports about air force interceptions and Russian submarine scandals. \\nAny European Union political party that has a neutral or favorable position to Russia will come under increased scrutiny and will face attacks on multiple fronts, mostly through the media. The EU will work to make examples of governments such as Hungary, Greece, and Italy that actively resist sanctions against Russia and attempt to circumvent sanctions by making their own economic arrangements with Russia. \\nEurope will be pressured to sign TTIP and will most likely become more and more dependent on the United States for economic and political policy. More LNG terminals will be built on the European mainland so that European countries can import natural gas from America and Qatar so that dependence on Russia is decreased. China will place less of an effort on the Silk Road overland trade route and will have to make a different trade arrangement with Europe. \\nMiddle East migration numbers will continue in full force as US policy in the Middle East will continue to favor interventionist hawks, forcing reluctant European nations to accept more and more refugees from Middle Eastern nations. The threat of terrorism will remain high and terrorist attacks are likely to occur again on European soil. \\nUS Relations with Russia and China \\nHillary Clinton \\nA Clinton administration will continue to play a double game with China, continuing the liberal policies of offshoring production to Chinese companies and maintaining a strong trade relationship on the one hand, but encircling China militarily with naval hardware and trade partnerships with local Chinese rivals. China will have a difficult time trying to push its goods to Europe through the Eurasian continent as the US will actively block attempts to create a Silk Road structure leading either through Russia or through Iran. However, on the surface, the US will continue to maintain a careful policy of wary respect toward China, never making overt insults or provocations and maintaining an air of pretentious respect. \\nRelations with Russia will be characterized by increased support to Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s enemies in Ukraine and Syria, as well as attempts to undermine the governments in Belarus and Central Asian countries. President Clinton will push European allies to increase economic pressure on Russia and media coverage of Russia from all ideological sides of American media will turn increasingly negative. All of this will take place while the United States will continue to do business with Russia as usual, buying rocket engines, space transport services, grain, and even certain types of weapons as if there was no issue in bilateral relations. \\nDonald Trump \\nThe strategic economic goals of a Trump presidency would almost immediately begin to cause problems for Chinese-American relations. If Trump acts on his promises to raise tariffs for American companies producing goods in foreign countries and then shipping them to the US, many businesses with manufacturing operations in China will be forced to shut down their Chinese subsidiaries, causing significant losses for China. China would potentially experience a major economic downturn as many of its factories and industrial centers would be forced out of business. China would not leave such an unkind gesture unanswered and would most likely sell a significant portion of its US Treasury bills and bonds on the market, or simply demand early payment, leading to a period of financial troubles for the US. \\nAmerican-Russian relations would potentially enter into a new and unprecedented period of mutual understanding and cooperation. President Trump would work to open Russiaâ\\x80\\x99s massive market even further to American companies and would deepen partnerships between the US and Russia in areas like space exploration and development, energy distribution and marketing, and perhaps even reopen programs focusing on purchase and delivery of Russian military hardware to groups supported by the Pentagon, including the program to arm and train the Afghan military with Russian helicopters. \\nIn all, both candidates offer substantially different visions of the future, and it is up to individual voters to decide which vision appears more rational and beneficial for both the United States and the world at large.

       " 'Report From the First Presidential DebateBy P.J. O Rourke On Monday night, presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton met for their first head-to-head debate. What was the evening s big news? Deion Jones returned a 90-yard interception to score a touchdown and cap the Atlanta Falcons  victory over the New Orleans Saints, 45-32! I didn t get to see that, though. I was watching the presidential debate   so you didn t have to. Compared with the NFL matchup, watching the presidential debate was like standing on the sidelines at a flag football game between a couple of Montessori schools. The only talented player on the field was NBC anchor Lester Holt, and what Holt was talented at was piling on Trump and making late hits for Team Hillary. The candidates themselves were no good. Trump has the gut issues going for him. But he can t articulate them well enough to make your reasoning fully agree with the feeling in the pit of your stomach. And he has trouble giving concise and to-the-point examples of what he means. Trump is too fond of the  broad stroke.  He s trying to paint a detailed picture of what s wrong with American politics while using only a four-inch brush. Hillary is good with the details   too good. Details are all she has. Lots and lots of highly detailed little thises and thats. Like she s furnishing a dollhouse instead of filling the White House. Hillary kept saying,  I have a plan.  It s a phrase that always sets off alarms for me. People who really have a plan are acting on the plan, not standing around saying they have one.  I have a plan  is right up there with  Hold my beer and watch this!  Who won the debate? That assumes it was a debate. It wasn t. It was a tedious rehash of issues that both candidates had already made a hash of. This was interspersed with some name-calling that commentators characterized as  heated,   harsh,  or even  scorching.  Which shows what wimps these commentators are. None of it would get you punched in the nose on the playground. Hillary had the best riposte. She brought up the notion, yet again, that Donald is someone who shouldn t be allowed anywhere near the nuclear launch codes. Trump:  That s getting old.  Hillary:  But good.  And Trump had, by far, the best line. He saved it for the very end:  Hillary has experience, but it s bad experience.  The winner was whomever you wanted to win. As far as I can tell from clicking around sources on the Internet, the candidate who won was the candidate that the source in question had already decided to declare victorious. It reminded me of Soviet judges scoring Olympic gymnastics back during the Cold War. Thus, the Washington Post and all its opinion columnists said Hillary won. Ditto for the New York Times. And in CNN s instant viewer polling, 62% of respondents gave the laurels to Hillary. On the other hand, the Drudge Report s instant polling awarded Trump the prize by 82%. And Charles Krauthammer   who, to my mind, is the smartest person on TV   called the debate  something like a draw.  Did we  learn  anything from the presidential debate? Short answer: No. Long answer: No. And yet, the debate turned out to be highly informative   if you turned the sound off. The event was broadcast with a split screen so that each candidate was visible while the other was talking (or, to use a technical term,  blabbing ). The blab was dull, but the expressions on the candidates  faces were fascinating. Trump was serious of mien. He was concentrating intently on what Hillary was saying. He sometimes developed a little twitch of annoyance. Other times, he wore a small frown of disagreement. But mostly, he looked deeply thoughtful. (And let s be frank, this is a man who could stand to do a bit more deep thinking.) Hillary is supposed to have a whole bunch of deep thoughts   concerning her endlessly convoluted plans to fix all the problems under the sun. But there she was, thoughtlessly making rude grimaces whenever Trump spoke. Mom always said,  You shouldn t make faces because your face may get stuck that way.  Hillary s face got stuck that way. She spent the whole evening with a wipe-that-look-off-your-face look on her face. She smirked. She sneered. She radiated smugness. She repeatedly mugged for the camera with a ham actor s pantomime  gasp of disbelief.  Except she is no actor. It came off like a cheap infomercial for new dentures. She indulged in nasty smiles of condescension. She adopted a pout that said,  What s a smarty like me doing with a dummy like him?  Hillary had an air about her as if she just couldn t believe that somehow, oh my gosh, she had been dragged up on stage to debate a talking dog. Hillary had a plan for the debate. Of course she did. Hillary has a plan for everything. And she stuck to her plan. The plan was to be utterly dismissive of Trump and anyone who backs him and to treat every single thing he has to say with total contempt. As I ve said before, I m not happy with either of these presidential candidates. It s a tough election. Do you roll the dice with Trump? Or do you let Hillary just set the bones down on the table, so you crap out again like always? I don t care, personally, if Hillary mocks Trump. But I do care, personally, when the nature of democracy itself is mocked. Trump is a man who decisively triumphed in the contest for the Republican Party s presidential nomination. And he is, as of the latest polling, in a dead heat with Hillary in the presidential race. When Hillary doesn t treat Trump with any measure of respect for the public support that he has achieved, she isn t insulting him, she s insulting American voters. If politics in a democracy has one rule, it s,  Don t insult the voters.  Regards, P.J. O Rourke',\n",

       " 'Susan Collins, Republican Senator from Maine, has once again broke with her party after announcing she will vote  no  on Donald Trump s education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos.Lisa Murkowski, Senator from Alaska, will also vote  no  on DeVos.On the Senate floor, Collins made a passionate speech about her reservations (which are shared by fellow Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Maine), saying:I come to the floor to announce a very difficult decision that I have made, and that is to vote against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos to be our nation s next Secretary of Education.The move comes unexpectedly, as Collins voted in favor of DeVos in committee, which passed on a party line and sent her nomination to the floor for an up-or-down vote. But at that time, Collins made clear she was still considering her support. Murkowski had also voted to send DeVos  consideration to the floor.Collins had told the Bangor Daily News that she was  surprised and concerned  about her  apparent lack of familiarity  on a wide range of education issues. One issue that particularly struck Collins was the fact DeVos seemed clueless to the fact the United States has protections for students with disabilities.Susan Collins has so far been a thorn in the side of Donald Trump and his administration, recently referring to his immigration executive action as  likely unconstitutional,  and blasting Steve Bannon s appointment to the National Security Council as  entirely inappropriate. As of now, 50 senators have come out against DeVos, including Collins, Murkowski and every member of the Democratic caucus (which includes independents Bernie Sanders and Angus King). DeVos needs a simple majority to pass, and with 52 members in the GOP caucus, DeVos has a slim chance of being confirmed. If one more Republican defects, the 50-50 tie that would be broken by Vice President Mike Pence will be blockedOnce again, Susan Collins has put the country before her party, and has showed the GOP what it means to have a spine, as has Murkowski.Here s to hoping more Republicans follow their lead.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'Yesterday, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was forced to leave the 9/11 memorial in New York City after falling ill.Although there was a perfectly reasonable explanation for why the former Secretary of State had to leave the event early (she was diagnosed with pneumonia), anti-Clinton conspiracy theorists have been working overtime to smear Clinton s name after she reappeared out of her daughter Chelsea s apartment not too long after being pushed into a car by her security team. This had wannabe online detectives going nuts and analyzing the photos, which lead to the #HillarysBodyDouble hashtag being created on Twitter   and who else would love to jump on this bandwagon more than Donald Trump lover Scott Baio?!Baio, who has had it out for Clinton for some time, did his best to further the conspiracy theory, and got a bit of karma in the process. Not only did Baio fail miserably in making Clinton look bad, but he managed to make HIMSELF look like a complete dumba** in the process. In a tweet, the actor mentioned an actress who is known for her amazing Clinton impersonations, calling her out: Does anyone know the whereabouts of this woman today? Was she in NYC? Lol TwitterThe woman Baio is talking about is Teresa Barnwell, whose website hillaryclintonimpersonator.com boasts the actress  ability to be a near spitting image of the former Secretary of State. Here s a screenshot of her homepage:Teresa BarnwellBut of course, just like his favorite presidential candidate, Baio hadn t bothered to actually check the facts and do his research (sound familiar?). If he had only checked Barnwell s Twitter account that day, he would have known not to ask. The actress tweeted Baio back, shutting his whole conspiracy down: I m in Los Angeles today. Not in NYC!

       " 'A Carrier union leader called Donald Trump out for his lies about the deal that supposedly saved American jobs from moving to Mexico. So what did Trump do? Tell the truth? Take responsibility for his actions? Recant his bogus claims? Oh, heck no! He attacked him on Twitter. Because of course he did.On Wednesday, United Steelworkers 1999 President Chuck Jones said Trump and his second in command, Mike Pence, used misleading numbers and pointed out that some of the jobs they took credit for saving weren t ever even leaving to begin with. What they re doing, they re counting in 350 odd more that were never leaving this country at all,  Jones told Burnett.  If you re dealing with people s livelihoods, you sure as hell ought to know what the numbers are. Jones said that, for some unknown reason, he believed Trump would do the right thing at his Dec. 1 press conference and tell the truth  that 550 jobs weren t saved. But he got up there,  Jones said,  and, for whatever reason, lied his ass off,  Jones said.Not being one to handle criticism well, Trump blew his top when Jones called out his B.S. and took to Twitter to voice his anger.Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers.

       " \"MostÂ\\xa0parents will do just about anything for their children, especially when it comes to education. Predictably, at a time when college costs are exploding and students are staggering under more than $1 trillion in debt, one opportunistic lender is making huge profits on loans to their doting moms and dads.\\n\\nLess predictably, that lender is the United States government.\\n\\nThe fast-growing federal program known as Parent PLUS now serves 3.2 million borrowers, who have racked up $65 billion in debt helping their kids go to school. The loans have much in common with the regular student loans that have created a national debt crisis and a 2016 campaign issue, but PLUS has much higher interest rates and fees, and far fewer opportunities for loan forgiveness or reductions.\\n\\nIn fact, the PLUS program, which includes similar loans to graduate students, is the most profitable of the 120 or so federal lending programs. That sounds like a good thing, until you remember the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s profit comes from its own citizens, often citizens of modest means.\\n\\nParent PLUS was created in 1980 to provide small loans to help reasonably well-off families finance the American Dream of an undergraduate education. But in an era of skyrocketing education costs, it has grown to look a lot like publicly funded predatory lending, providing almost any borrowers with almost unlimited cash to attend any school with almost no regard to their ability to repay. Thirteen percent of undergraduates now rely on Parent PLUS, and many of their parents are falling into debt traps.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou feel so guilty that you havenâ\\x80\\x99t done enough for your kid, and they make it so easy to get the loans,â\\x80\\x9d said Elizabeth Hill, a 57-year-old property appraiser from the Boston suburbs with more than $30,000 inÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0debt. â\\x80\\x9cThen theyâ\\x80\\x99ve got you by theÂ\\xa0cojones. Itâ\\x80\\x99s like â\\x80\\x98The Sopranos,â\\x80\\x99 except itâ\\x80\\x99s the government.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor all the controversy swirling around student loans, lending money directly to students at least has a â\\x80\\x9chuman capitalâ\\x80\\x9d rationale,Â\\xa0since recipients pursue degrees that can boost their earning power and help them fulfill their obligations.Â\\xa0But when parents borrow, theyâ\\x80\\x99re often taking on new debts just as their earning power is starting to dwindle. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re not building human capital. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re just getting closer to retirement, mortgaging their futures on behalf of their children.Â\\xa0AndÂ\\xa0if they default, the government can garnish their wages and even their Social Security checks â\\x80\\x94 less brutal than â\\x80\\x9cThe Sopranos,â\\x80\\x9d but just as effective.\\n\\nAccording to the White House budget office, the expected recovery rate for defaulted Parent PLUS loans is a remarkable 106 percent, a testament to Uncle Samâ\\x80\\x99s unique power as a collection agency. Overall, the program is expected to return $1.23 on every dollar it lends this year, thanks to its relatively high interest rates and minimal opportunities for debt relief, as well as the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s relentlessness in tracking down overdue education loans. The only federal loans that generate slightly better returns are the similar PLUS loans to graduate students, which have much lower default rates.\\n\\nPOLITICO has been investigating theÂ\\xa0governmentâ\\x80\\x99sÂ\\xa0bizarre $3.3Â\\xa0trillion loan portfolio,Â\\xa0which is riddled with tensions between the interests of borrowers and taxpayers. Some credit programs are almost comically risky for the government, most memorably a rural broadband effort with an official default rate of a seemingly impossible 116 percent.Â\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0loans are the flip side of the coin, generating reliable profits forÂ\\xa0taxpayers butÂ\\xa0serious risks for moderate-income borrowers.\\n\\nJust about everyone I interviewed thought Congress should consider major reforms toÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0when it takes up a higher education bill thisÂ\\xa0fall, butÂ\\xa0no one was too optimistic that reforms would pass,Â\\xa0largely because of those profits.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0is classic predatory lending. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not a safe product for many of these families, and the debts will hound them forever,â\\x80\\x9d said Rachel Fishman, an education policy analyst at the nonpartisan New America think tank. â\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s a cash cow for the government, so itâ\\x80\\x99s going to be extremely difficult to reform.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0is not a trap for everyone. The latest data suggest that only 5 percent of borrowers are defaulting within their first three years of repayment, although that figure is rising rapidly. TheÂ\\xa0White House budget tablesÂ\\xa0suggest the expected default rate over the course of the loans is well above 10 percent, which is still well below the rate for regular student loans. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a wealth of evidence that college degrees boost lifetime earnings, and defenders of Parent PLUS say itâ\\x80\\x99s an important tool for increasing college graduation rates. PLUS loans have also become a key revenue source for many schools, particularly historically black colleges and for-profits that tend to serve lower-income families.\\n\\nBut that just illustrates the increasingly tortured economic paradoxes at the heart of modern higher education, where schools have no incentive to provide affordable prices as long as they can count on federal dollars for makingÂ\\xa0education affordable.Â\\xa0Ultimately, ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0sluices more cash into the college-industrial complex, helping educators jack up their tuitions while pressuring parents to make up the difference with debt, while doing nothing to ensure theyâ\\x80\\x99re getting a real return on their investment. It enhances accessibility, but not really affordability, simply givingÂ\\xa0parents a way to puntÂ\\xa0the skyrocketing costs into the future.Â\\xa0Even some advocates who fiercely defended Parent PLUS during a high-profile controversy in 2011,Â\\xa0when the Obama administration briefly reined inÂ\\xa0loans toÂ\\xa0parents with sketchy credit histories, told me the program is deeply troubled and inherently flawed.\\n\\nWhen I spoke to White House education adviser Roberto Rodriguez about this conundrum, he emphasized that President Barack Obama has crusaded to make America the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leader in access to higher education, expandingÂ\\xa0Pell grants to low-income students and â\\x80\\x9cincome-based repaymentâ\\x80\\x9d for burdensome student loans, while proposing to make community college free. Parent PLUS, he said, is another important tool to help young people pursue a better life. But he also said he'sÂ\\xa0concerned that too many struggling parents are getting in too deep. When I asked him if the Education Department was running a predatory lending program, he didnâ\\x80\\x99t say no.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the heart of the matter,â\\x80\\x9d Rodriguez said. â\\x80\\x9cYou want to expand access and choice, but you also want to make sure families can afford these loans.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHILL AND HER husband are solidly middle class and proudly thrifty; she drives a 15-year-old minivan and shops at TJ Maxx. She and her husband put away money for their son Aaronâ\\x80\\x99s education, and though they burned through some savings when Hill lost her job early in the Great Recession, they figured theyâ\\x80\\x99d be fine when Aaron chose the University of Massachusetts at Amherst over several private colleges. He also won some academic grants and maxed out on federal student loans. But even a public school like UMass cost $25,000 a year.Â\\xa0Hill just couldnâ\\x80\\x99t make the numbers work.\\n\\nUntil, suddenly, she could. Hill discovered she was eligible forÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUS, which would cover whatever Aaronâ\\x80\\x99s grants and loans didnâ\\x80\\x99t. At the time, Hill felt like she had won something, even though the loans are entitlements for anyone without a recent history of â\\x80\\x9cadverse credit.â\\x80\\x9d She feels differently now that Aaron has moved back home with his degree and taken a job at a local liquor store â\\x80\\x94 and her husband may have to postpone his plans for retirement to make ends meet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re at your witsâ\\x80\\x99 end, you want to help your kid, and this fairy princess appears on your computer and says: â\\x80\\x98Want some money?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Hill recalled. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re like: Bingo! Itâ\\x80\\x99s more than you can afford, but dammit, education is important, right? Then four years later, you canâ\\x80\\x99t believe how much you owe.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhen Congress created Parent PLUS 35 years ago, the loans were capped at $3,000 per year, until that was lifted in 1992 so families could borrow as much as they wanted toward the cost of attendance at any public or private school. But the rules do not allow colleges to ask about their income or their ability to pay. And the borrowers donâ\\x80\\x99t have to start making payments until the student leaves school, although the interest accumulates the whole time.\\n\\nCongress set the maximum interest rate at 9 percent in 1980, which seemed generous at a time when mortgage rates were skyrocketing toward 18 percent, but Parent PLUS is no longer a particularly attractive deal for families with other options. The current rates are about 7 percentÂ\\xa0plusÂ\\xa0a 4 percent origination fee, a lot lower than credit card debt or payday loans, but a lot higher than subsidized student loans.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI figured the rate wasnâ\\x80\\x99t terrible, and the money was so easy to get,â\\x80\\x9d said Debbie Hounanian, a 56-year-old office manager in the Los Angeles suburbs who racked up $54,000 inÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0debt. â\\x80\\x9cI had no idea what I was getting into.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nToday, the averageÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0loan is about $13,000, and manyÂ\\xa0parents pile up much larger debts now that some schoolsÂ\\xa0cost more than $50,000 a year. The loans are almost impossible to discharge in bankruptcy, just like student loans, but theyâ\\x80\\x99re ineligible for most of the income-based paymentÂ\\xa0relief available for student loans. Consumer advocates compare them to subprime mortgages before the bust, encouraging families to bite off more debtÂ\\xa0than they can chew â\\x80\\x94 exceptÂ\\xa0that ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0also has a government imprimatur.\\n\\nToby Merrill, who runs a Harvard-affiliated legal services clinic that focuses on predatory lending, recalls one ready-to-retire borrower who contacted her after running up $150,000 inÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0debt on three children.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe question was: What are my options?â\\x80\\x9d Merrill said. â\\x80\\x9cIt was sad, because the answer was: You donâ\\x80\\x99t really have options.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAS STATE AID for higher education has plunged while the cost of college has escalated,Â\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0loans have become an increasingly routine method of filling the gap, with about 700,000 new loans every year. Some schools actually includeÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0in their financial aid offers, tellingÂ\\xa0parents theyâ\\x80\\x99ve qualified to take out, say, $20,000 inÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0loans, a rather disingenuous way of saying the actual offer will leave them $20,000 short of the school's official cost of attendance. Colleges with tight budgets have little incentive to tell students they canâ\\x80\\x99t afford to enroll, and strong incentives to encourage students to load up onÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0loans that pass directly into their coffers. The president of Albany State University in Georgia even admitted at a public hearing that cash-strapped colleges have been steering students from student loans into more onerous and expensiveÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0loans, because theyâ\\x80\\x99re required to report default rates for student loans but not forÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUS.\\n\\nThe 2011 controversy over Parent PLUS, when the Obama administration temporarily tightened the programâ\\x80\\x99s lax vetting process, illuminated the extent to which colleges and families have become dependent on the cash.Â\\xa0It erupted after the Education Departmentâ\\x80\\x99s financial aid office finally recognized a longstanding absurdity: the â\\x80\\x9cadverse creditâ\\x80\\x9d reviews forÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0applicants were flagging some delinquent debts, but not debts that were so delinquent they had been sent to collection agencies or written off. As a result, many applicants were getting loans with worse credit than rejected applicants.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt made no sense,â\\x80\\x9d said Ben Miller, who was a senior policy adviser at the department during theÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0flap and is now director of post-secondary education at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. â\\x80\\x9cBut fixing the problem had a much bigger impact than anyone realized it would.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nQuietly, the department started counting more bad debts in its credit reviews â\\x80\\x94 andÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0rejection rates soared. StudentsÂ\\xa0who couldnâ\\x80\\x99t renew their loans beganÂ\\xa0dropping out of school. And schools that relied heavily onÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0revenue began hemorrhaging cash. At historically black colleges and universities, which had been particularly hard-hit by the recession, the number ofÂ\\xa0PLUS recipients dropped 45 percent over the next two years, depriving them of an estimated $150 million. Three struggling black collegesâ\\x80\\x94in Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina â\\x80\\x94 ended up shutting their doors, and larger schools like Morehouse endured mass layoffs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOur schools were screaming bloody murder,â\\x80\\x9d said Thurgood Marshall College Fund President Johnny C. Taylor Jr., a leading advocate for historically black colleges and universities. â\\x80\\x9cForget salt â\\x80\\x94 this was pouring acid in our wounds.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor-profit schools absorbed an even bigger hit, a 54 percent decline inÂ\\xa0PLUS enrollment. But for obvious political reasons, the black schools (with fierce support from the Congressional Black Caucus) led the fight to get the first African-American president to reverse or at least delay the changes. Taylor and other advocates had several tense meetings with Education Secretary Arne Duncan, repeatedly asking why a two-decade-old snafu had to be corrected immediately, why the tougher reviews couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be limited to new PLUSÂ\\xa0applicants, why a secretary who had said expanding access to college would be his â\\x80\\x9cNorth Starâ\\x80\\x9d was restricting access to college. Duncan emphasized that the changes werenâ\\x80\\x99t directed at black schools, but Taylor shot back that they were having a disproportionate effect on black schools.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe secretary kept saying: My lawyers are telling us to do this; weâ\\x80\\x99re doing our best to work it out,â\\x80\\x9d Taylor said. â\\x80\\x9cGive me a break! We were trying to revive a community with double the unemployment rate of the majority community.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEventually, Duncan publicly apologized to black college leaders for the abruptness of the changes, acknowledging that â\\x80\\x9ccommunication internally and externally was poor.â\\x80\\x9d He promised to consider appeals from all rejected PLUSÂ\\xa0applicants, and launched a process to write newÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0credit rules.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was an operational screw-up of epic proportions,â\\x80\\x9d said Justin Draeger, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. â\\x80\\x9cBut it was a pretty good reminder thatÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0helps a lot of people pay for college.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn 2014, the department announced the newÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0rules, essentially reversing its efforts to tighten credit checks. Bad debts are no longer grounds for rejection if theyâ\\x80\\x99re less than $2,085 (versus $500 in the old rule) or less than two years old (versus five years). The department didnâ\\x80\\x99t even require loan counseling for allÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0borrowers, just those who managed to get loans despite adverse credit.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a shame. MostÂ\\xa0parents would be better off taking a second mortgage,â\\x80\\x9d said Natalia Abrams, director of the advocacy group Student Debt Crisis. â\\x80\\x9cInstead, theyâ\\x80\\x99re getting trapped. They assume that if the government is offering these loans, they must be safe.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo my surprise, TaylorÂ\\xa0told me he agrees. Taylor was probably the most outspoken critic of the administrationâ\\x80\\x99s short-lived efforts to rein inÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUS, and he still believes it was unfair to change the rules so suddenly after a brutal downturn. But he asked me not to describe him as aÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0defender. He said the program is so exploitative that he once investigated a class-action lawsuit, but found that debt-ravagedÂ\\xa0parents were too ashamed to go public.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a horrible program, totally out of control,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve got to figure out a way to make college affordable, butÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0is definitely not the answer.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOBAMA'S NEW CONSUMER Financial Protection Bureau has raised alarms about predatory lending by bankers and mortgage brokers. At a recent event, Richard Hunt, the president of the Consumer Bankers Association, posed a question to CFPB Director Richard Cordray: â\\x80\\x9cWhy arenâ\\x80\\x99t you doing anything aboutÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUS?â\\x80\\x9d Cordray replied that he didnâ\\x80\\x99t have jurisdiction over the federal government, but Hunt believes that if one of his members offered a similar loan product with similarly negligible underwriting standards, the bureau would be all over it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe silence has been deafening,â\\x80\\x9d Hunt said. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s sinister to see the government throw money at people with no clue if they can pay it back.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHunt would like to see the private sector â\\x80\\x94 that is,Â\\xa0his members â\\x80\\x94 take over the business. And some private lenders are starting to compete withÂ\\xa0Parent PLUS â\\x80\\x94 one Rhode Island bank is offering a similar product with a much lower interest rate of 3 percent and no origination fees for the mostÂ\\xa0creditworthy borrowers. But whileÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0loans donâ\\x80\\x99t have the same protections as federal student loans, they do include some options most private banks wonâ\\x80\\x99t match, like the ability to defer payments for years.\\n\\nWhatÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0lacks is flexibility.Â\\xa0Parents who qualify can borrow whatever they need for their kids to attend whatever school they want, whileÂ\\xa0parents who get rejected canâ\\x80\\x99t borrow a dime. In another hearing, anÂ\\xa0administrator of a North Carolina college sharedÂ\\xa0a sad vignette about a homeless woman who was denied aÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0loan, implicitly suggesting the government should have extended her virtually unlimited credit. In fact, thatâ\\x80\\x99s exactly what would have happened if her credit had been clean. Nobody would have been allowed to try to gauge whether her income or assets gave her any hope of repayment.Â\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0suffers from a paradox that also afflicts government loans for agriculture, shipbuilding and just about everything else: Itâ\\x80\\x99s highly risky for borrowers who need itÂ\\xa0mostÂ\\xa0desperately, whileÂ\\xa0theÂ\\xa0borrowers whoÂ\\xa0could most easily handle the debtÂ\\xa0could probably get by without it.\\n\\nMany critics argue thatÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0should be abolished, and that the government should expand Pell grants and raise caps on student loans instead. But even those who want to continue the program â\\x80\\x94 including Rodriguez in the White House and Republican staffers on Capitol Hill â\\x80\\x94 seem to agree there are relativelyÂ\\xa0obviousÂ\\xa0ways to strengthen it. The most evident would be real underwriting standards to evaluate the ability to pay of potential borrowers. Another would be strict loan caps. Or a combination of those reforms could link the creditworthiness of borrowers to the size of the loans theyâ\\x80\\x99re eligible to receive, theÂ\\xa0kind of calculation real banks make.Â\\xa0Even Draeger, who represents aid administrators at 3,000 colleges and universities, said the system needs structural changes to protect vulnerable families.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe definitely support new underwriting standards.Â\\xa0Parents are getting in too deep, and itâ\\x80\\x99s affecting their ability to retire and enjoy life,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cRight now, schools just have to follow the rules, and from a consumer protection standpoint, the rules are dangerous.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe major obstacle to reform, beyond Washingtonâ\\x80\\x99s general dysfunction and polarization, is the immense profitability ofÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUS.Â\\xa0These days, the government borrows money at almost no cost, so lending at 7 percent plus fees can add up: Parent PLUS could reduce the deficit by $3 billion this year.Â\\xa0That means any effort to scale it back and restrict it to creditworthy borrowers would cost the governmentÂ\\xa0a lot of money. Politicians generallyÂ\\xa0donâ\\x80\\x99t like paying more money to provide fewer benefits, especially when a well-organized political coalition has defendedÂ\\xa0those benefits in the past.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the perversity of a loan program like this,â\\x80\\x9d one senior GOP aide said. â\\x80\\x9cIt makes it that much harder to fix.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn other words, Washington has become as dependent onÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0loans as the schools that flack them and theÂ\\xa0parents who receive them. The status quo hasÂ\\xa0tremendousÂ\\xa0power, becauseÂ\\xa0Congress likes profitable programs, schools like reliable revenue, andÂ\\xa0parents like to help their kids.\\n\\nHill and her husband have another son getting ready to start Ithaca College, just as theyâ\\x80\\x99re starting to pay back Aaronâ\\x80\\x99s loan, but they're determined to help out again. They haven't figured out how they're going to do that yet, becauseÂ\\xa0there's no way they'reÂ\\xa0going back to theÂ\\xa0ParentÂ\\xa0PLUSÂ\\xa0well again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFool me once, right?â\\x80\\x9d Hill said. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want to put my kid in a bind, but these loans areÂ\\xa0ridiculous. The guilt system only goes so far.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'With every new detail revealing itself about Donald Trump s administration, the humiliation that America is enduring is getting harder and harder to stomach. We have never seen an administration fail so hard from the start, and just when it seems it can get no worse, Trump sets a new precedent. The latest detail in Trump s White House will have Americans more disappointed than ever before.Apparently, the morons in the Trump administration are so incompetent and lazy, they aren t even able to choose top officials correctly. Vanity Fair just reported a VERY disturbing detail about Trump s China adviser, who was sought out by the POTUS  son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Kushner chose this adviser not by interviewing experts, like a normal person   Kushner found Trump s China adviser by searching Amazon. Vanity Fair wrote:At one point during the campaign, when Trump wanted to speak more substantively about China, he gave Kushner a summary of his views and then asked him to do some research. Kushner simply went on Amazon, where he was struck by the title of one book, Death by China, co-authored by Peter Navarro. He cold-called Navarro, a well-known trade-deficit hawk, who agreed to join the team as an economic adviser. (When he joined, Navarro was in fact the campaign s only economic adviser.) Kushner operated in much the same way when it came to crafting Trump s tax plan calling up someone for help out of the blue. Given the initial absence of pros who could do the job properly, he also tried his hand at writing speeches. Responding to criticism from the boss ( Jared, this is terrible! ), Kushner said, according to a person familiar with the episode,  I m not a fucking speechwriter. I am a real-estate guy. The idiocy being displayed here is mind boggling. Kushner, who at least has the sense to admit that he s way out of his league and he s just  a real-estate guy , is the person Trump has put in charge of basically everything. The same man that s looking for advisers on Amazon.Let s not forget that this idiot is the man in charge of bringing peace to the Middle East. With this amount of incompetency in the White House, it will be a miracle if the United States can get through Trump s presidency without a major crisis, although we re already getting pretty close to one after Trump s attack on Syria and Afghanistan, and his inflammatory comments toward China and North Korea.If anyone thought that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were going to being the check and balance for Trump, this report certainly crushes that hope. Even the most level headed people in Trump s administration are dangerously ill-equipped.Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty Images',\n",
       " 'Eight ways to strengthen our democracy beyond voting The strength of our civic life depends on what we do outside elections. By Chuck Collins   Chuck Collins \\nThroughout this trying election season, weâ\\x80\\x99ve been told how much is at stake with our vote. But the success of any democracy depends on continuing to pay attention long after we cast our ballots. \\nSo letâ\\x80\\x99s pledge to strengthen our democracy with a few resolutions to focus our intentions and keep us moving forward over the next four years. \\n1. Change your media diet . \\nWay too much ink, airtime, and mental real estate has been consumed by the horserace reporting on electionsâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s all about whoâ\\x80\\x99s winning and losing. So unplug from the talk shows that interview pollsters and engage in partisan bickering all day. Find the commentators and independent media outlets that strengthen our civic life. \\n2. Turn off corporate media. \\nThis election has been very profitable for big media corporations, but bad for our democracy. As CBS chairman Les Moonves remarked , â\\x80\\x9cMan, who would have expected the ride weâ\\x80\\x99re all having right now? The moneyâ\\x80\\x99s rolling in and this is fun.â\\x80\\x9d \\nOur differences have been compounded by media reports that amplify the loudest and most partisan utterances. Election coverage this year has encouraged us to view one another as cartoon caricatures, not neighbors. \\n3. Reject the consumer mentality in elections . \\nWeâ\\x80\\x99re encouraged to view national elections like consumers buying a car, but presidential elections can make most of us feel like spectators, not participants. Election Day is a small part of our real democracyâ\\x80\\x94think of voting as a tiny fraction of your civic life. \\n4. Make your voice heard . \\nPledge to communicate with your elected officials all year round, not just when they want your vote. Call, write, email, and attend community forums. When a politician hears from a dozen constituents with the same concern, it matters. \\nA few resolutions must address our polarized political atmosphere. The only way to break through this is by connecting with people we donâ\\x80\\x99t always agree with. \\nFor instance, the liberal California sociologist Arlie Hochschild spent five years interviewing conservative Tea Party activists in Louisiana, making friends and asking deep questions. She urges us all to scale the â\\x80\\x9cempathy wallâ\\x80\\x9d and learn each otherâ\\x80\\x99s stories. \\nHereâ\\x80\\x99s a few easy ways to get started. \\n5.Try a social media fast. \\nSocial media is amazing, but it mostly serves as an echo chamber to reinforce our existing views. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not a substitute for talking to people, asking questions, and learning why people support certain policies. \\n6. Practice the art of civil discourse . \\nFind ways to meet others face-to-face to engage in conversations, not soapbox speeches and debates. Look at the â\\x80\\x9c Living Room Conversation â\\x80\\x9d movement that brings people together across political divisions. Their goal is to encourage â\\x80\\x9cauthentic, respectful conversationsâ\\x80\\x9d to â\\x80\\x9cstrengthen relationships and advance understanding of the challenges, opportunities, and solutions before us.â\\x80\\x9d \\nFinally, other resolutions should focus on changing our polarizing election system. \\n7. Eliminate the wealth primary . \\nLong before voters cast their ballots in a primary, big money donors have winnowed the field and selected who will stand for election. People all across the political spectrum agree that we need fundamental campaign finance reform to reduce the influence of big money, including the repeal of Citizens United . \\n8. Break the two-party duopoly . \\nA growing number of voters have declared independence from the two major parties. So why do we allow other voices and perspectives to be excluded from presidential debates? Our democracy would benefit if we had real choices outside the two major parties, as they do in most other countries in the world. \\nThe strength of our civic life depends on what we do outside elections. And especially after the deeply toxic experience of 2016, we all need to step up to protect our real democracy from those who profit from division. \\nChuck Collins co-edits Inequality.org at the Institute for Policy Studies and is author of the new book, Born on Third Base: A One Percenter Makes the Case for Tackling Inequality, Bringing Wealth Home, and Committing to the Common Good .

       " \"3 Shares\\n2 0 0 1\\nThe signing of the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement with Canada (CETA) on the 30th of October marks the beginning of North America's annexation of Europe. The negotiations for the treaty were carried out behind closed doors. For over 751 deputies in the European Parliament, there are more than 30 thousands lobbyists. The Society for European Affairs Professionals (SEAP) - the organisation which lobbying on behalf of multinational corporations â\\x80\\x93 this is the real power block in Europe. The European worker has absolutely no say and henceforth he will lose the right to form join unions. Multinational corporations will have unlimited power over European workers, who will see the destruction of what is left of social gains won from over a century of class struggle.\\nWill European workers lie down and accept this imposture? What concrete policies would weaken the stranglehold of corporations over European workers? Which parties in the current political landscape hold policies which, if implemented, would weaken the transatlantic stranglehold?\\nThere are currently no political parties running in the major European elections with candidates who genuinely represent workers' interests. But there are some political movements which threaten the corporate 'power-elite'. We will mention them below.\\nThere are two important geopolitical processes to consider here. The first is the East-West corporate , geopolitical axis. America is pulling the European peninsula away from the Eurasian continent. With the installation of a neo-Nazi regime in Kiev, Washington attempted to re-create an 'Intermarium' from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and down to the Eastern Mediterranean - driving a permanent wedge between Russia and Germany.\\nIn order to facilitate the social transformation of Europe into a 'America Minor', millions of 'pilgrims' are necessary. Hence, the deployment of coercive engineered migration as a tool to replace class- conscious European workers with deracine youths - in some instances educated enough to do the low-paid work assigned to them and acculturated enough to pose no problem to the 'Power-Elite'.\\nIn the new Trotskyite language of this imperial order, any leader who attempts to stem the tide of globalisation through populist appeals to tradition and national identity is 'fascist'. Fascist is a loaded term which generally connotes evil in the public mind. In each European country there is a ready-made army of youths from wealthy families whose job is to don hoddies, attack police and scream 'fascist' and 'racist' at working-class people desperately trying to find a way out of this nightmare. These 'antifa' are the modern equivalent to Oswald Mosley's fascist gangs in the 1930s; they represent the same class interests .Petty-bourgeois leftism is the New World Order's avant-garde.\\nA favourite passtime of the 'Antifa' mob is throwing stones at police officers. One can only gain acceptance in the anti-fascist gang by showing how much one hates the 'pigs'. So, police officers from honest working-class families get burned alive while the anti-fa mob chants slogans from the Spanish Civil War. Such violence is now a regular occurrence in demonstrations. The agents provocateurs often receive help from the intelligence services. French police are finding it hard to cope with the chaos developing all over French suburbs. They complain that they are not sufficiently equipped and do not have the powers necessary to deal with the growing violence from delinquents. They have been demonstrating in Paris. They have been calling for an end to the control of the French police by free masonry. Exacerbating the problem is the deep-seated racism of many police officers who target Black youths with spot-checksm â\\x80\\x93 very often without reason.\\nThe recent demonstrations by French police in France against poor working conditions and low pay strongly suggests that there is the possibility that the rank and file of the French police could be waking up to the reality that France is government by a criminal gang. After the Magnanville terrorist attack in June where two police officers were killed, a police officer at the funeral of the deceased refused to shake the hand of President Hollande and Prime Minister Manuel Valls. It was a highly significant act of insubordination.\\nThe police, who in capitalist societies are the guardians of the ruling class, are beginning to realise the criminality of the people they are protecting; they are perhaps beginning to understand that the role of the state is to impose the dictatorship of one class over another - that of the minority of super wealthy over the labouring masses.\\nMany of these dissident police officers are linked to Le Pen's National Front. A reliable source in French intelligence informed me that the secret services spend more time watching the far-right than the so-called 'far left'. They see the far right as a real potential danger to the ruling order, whereas the far left present no danger but are in fact a key component of ruling class ideology. From the 'Arab Spring' to Nuit Debout, the far-left are the life-blood of capitalism. The potential of a major split between the national and compradore bourgeoise of imperial states for prospects of working-class gains is something that needs more study.\\nWhat should we make of all this in the context of CETA? As I have said on numerous occasions, the far right in France are and always have been political opportunists who exploit the despair of the masses; they serve the interests of the national bourgeoisie. But the National Front are regularly denounced by the media, not for being right wing. Rather, they are dismissed as being closer to the far left. The prospect of raising worker's salaries, nationalisation of key industries and a halt on the importation of cheap labour appeal to working-class families.\\nAs I have pointed out before, looking at a debate between the Trotskyist Jean-Luc Melanchon and Marine Le Pen in 2011, one would have thought that Le Pen was was the leftist and Melanchon the right-wing militarist. Melanchon shamelessly defended the NATO bombing campaign of Libya, while Le Pen opposed it!\\nCivil war on the horizon\\nThe right-wing presidential candidate Philippe de Villiers has said there are plans afoot to divide the French territory between Muslims and non-Muslims. He Quote: s Francois Hollande's own writings to back up his claims. Everyone is talking about an imminent civil war. In the bars and cafes of Paris one can hear more and more disgruntled French citizens talking about media disinformation, the demonisation of Russia, the homogenisation of thought and the criminality of the ruling class.\\nThe scene has never been more propitious to a populist take over of French politics. But one should not have illusions about the National Front; they are following the menacious Zionist narrative on the war on terror: Muslims are the problem. The party's vice-president Forian Philippot is close to the ultra-Zionist lawyer Gilles-William Goldnagel, a friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\\nPhilippot recently condemned the comments of presidential candidate Jean- FrÃ©dÃ©ric Poisson who said Hillary Clinton presented the greatest threat for the world as she is in the pay of the Zionists. Poisson was subsequently forced to kneel before the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF) where he sought forgiveness. He was told he would be forgiven but they they would never forget! In spite of the National Front's anti-Muslim bias, an increasing number of Muslims are voting for the party. Many Muslims prefer the National Front as they are sick and tired of being patronised and manipulated by the left â\\x80\\x93 with their pseudo 'anti-racism' and 'humanitarian' wars.\\nThere have also been major strikes by police in Ireland for similar reasons to France. French workers are losing everything and will soon become a lumpen proletariat. Meanwhile the French government has programmes in place to encourage migrants heading to Britain to stay in France. The Socialist Party is creating a new electorate. It is a wise move for them because after the next election abstentionism will be the norm and the indigenous lumpen proletariat will resent the migrants. The oligarchs will keep the masses in bondage through GMOS, Takfiri anti-Islam and total reification of life. CETA is the beginning of the end for social hope. It is the prelude to the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) â\\x80\\x93 the most evil trade deal in history.\\nFrench vice-president of the Trilateral Commission Herve de Carmoy wrote a book in 2007 entitled 'L'Euramerique' â\\x80\\x93 Euramerica, where he argues for the formation of what amounts to a transatlantic super-state run by a financial oligarchy. CETA is the prelude to that project.\",\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will vote next week on new sanctions on Iranâ\\x80\\x99s ballistic missile program and on Lebanonâ\\x80\\x99s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia, senior House Republicans said on Friday, seeking to take a tough line against Iran without immediately moving to undermine the international nuclear deal. â\\x80\\x9cIt is Congressâ\\x80\\x99 responsibility to work with the executive branch on a clear-eyed strategy to stop Iranâ\\x80\\x99s reckless behavior,â\\x80\\x9d Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the number two House Republican, and Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a joint statement emailed to Reuters. â\\x80\\x9cImmediate action towards this goal will come from the House next week as we vote on legislation that furthers sanctions on Hezbollah and Iranâ\\x80\\x99s missile proliferation,â\\x80\\x9d they said. President Donald Trump defied both allies and adversaries on Oct. 13 by refusing to certify that Iran is complying with an international agreement on its nuclear program, and threatened that he might ultimately terminate the accord. That threw the fate of the agreement between Iran, the United States and other world powers into the hands of Congress, by opening a 60-day window in which Congress could reimpose, or  â\\x80\\x9csnap back,â\\x80\\x9d sanctions on Iranâ\\x80\\x99s nuclear program that were lifted under the agreement. However, many of Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s fellow Republicans - who all opposed the deal reached under former Democratic President Barack Obama - have said they see no immediate need to do so. Congressional aides said that, for now, House lawmakers are focusing on clamping down on Iran in other ways such as the missile and Hezbollah sanctions. In the Senate, a separate effort is under way to amend existing U.S. law to set new conditions for the U.S. role in the pact, although critics said such a plan could violate terms of the deal, formally known as the JCPOA. Britain, France and Germany, European U.S. allies who signed the agreement, are particularly concerned about Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s action and have lobbied Congress to preserve the nuclear pact. Among other things, the ballistic missiles bill would toughen existing sanctions by going after entities with assets outside the United States if they were found to support Iranâ\\x80\\x99s ballistic missile program. It has broad bipartisan support in the House, and also is expected to pass the Senate. The Hezbollah bill is directed at the Shiâ\\x80\\x99ite militiaâ\\x80\\x99s allies in Lebanonâ\\x80\\x99s government and asks the Trump administration to estimate and distribute assessments of the net worth of Lebanese politicians. The Senate has already unanimously passed a different version of the Hezbollah sanctions bill. ',\n",
       " 'SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (Reuters) - First lady Michelle Obama and representatives from nine former presidential families led a bipartisan gathering of politicians and celebrities in paying memorial tribute to Nancy Reagan, whose love for her late husband, Ronald Reagan, was hailed as a romance â\\x80\\x9cfor the ages.â\\x80\\x9d In an invitation-only funeral for about 1,000 guests to her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s presidential library in Southern California, the onetime Hollywood actress turned first lady was remembered for the fierce devotion she accorded her spouse during their White House years and his long struggle with Alzheimerâ\\x80\\x99s disease. â\\x80\\x9cTheirs was a love story for the ages,â\\x80\\x9d former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said of the couple, during a service that organizers say Nancy Reagan herself helped plan in advance. â\\x80\\x9cThey had style, they had grace and they had class.â\\x80\\x9d Former White House chief of staff James Baker called Nancy Reagan the â\\x80\\x9cconsummate political wife and first lady,â\\x80\\x9d and a figure whose support, encouragement and political savvy were indispensable to her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s political success. After her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s death at age 93 in 2004, she â\\x80\\x9cdedicated herself to his memory and his place in history,â\\x80\\x9d Baker said.  The funeral brought together prominent Republicans and Democrats alike in salute of a woman especially admired by political conservatives at a time when deep partisan rancor has reverberated through Washington and the 2016 presidential campaign. The list of VIPs attending the memorial was headed by President Barack Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s wife, who sat beside former President George W. Bush and his spouse, Laura, and two fellow former first ladies - Jimmy Carterâ\\x80\\x99s wife, Rosalynn, and the Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton. Seated nearby were the Reagansâ\\x80\\x99 daughter Patti Davis and son Ron Jr., - both of whom eulogized their mother - along with Caroline Kennedy, daughter of the late President John Kennedy, and children of his three immediate successors - Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.     Davis described her mother and father as â\\x80\\x9ctwo halves of a circle, closed tightâ\\x80\\x9d while her brother, Ron, said that â\\x80\\x9cas a couple, they were more than the sum of their parts.â\\x80\\x9d She was to the president, Baker recalled, â\\x80\\x9cabsolutely without a doubt his closest advisor,â\\x80\\x9d adding she was particularly adept at knowing who was truly loyal to her spouse and who was not. He credited Nancy Reagan with prodding her husband to open a dialogue with then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a relationship that helped ease Cold War tensions. She could be â\\x80\\x9ctough as a Marine drill sergeant ... when things werenâ\\x80\\x99t going well,â\\x80\\x9d Baker said, recounting he only saw Nancy Reagan lose her cool once - the day in March 1980 when her husband was wounded by gunfire from a would-be assassin. â\\x80\\x9cShe was devastated, and in fact, she fell apart,â\\x80\\x9d he said, adding that she returned with her husband to the White House after his discharge from the hospital â\\x80\\x9cwith a fierce determination to protect him in every way she possibly could.â\\x80\\x9d Rain began to fall over the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, north of Los Angeles, as the service ended and a military honor guard carried the flower-bedecked mahogany casket from the memorial gathering beneath a large white tent to a nearby grave site on the grounds.  Nancy Reagan, who died on Sunday of congestive heart failure at age 94 [nL1N16E06K], was to be buried beside her husband later on Friday, though no family members planned to attend, having already â\\x80\\x9csaid their goodbyes,â\\x80\\x9d according to library spokeswoman Melissa Giller. Others dignitaries among the funeral guests were broadcast journalists Diane Sawyer and Tom Brokaw, California Governor Jerry Brown, former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, as well as such showbiz figures as Oscar-winning actress Anjelica Huston and singer Wayne Newton. Even the actor known as Mr. T, a well-known supporter of Nancy Reaganâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cJust Say Noâ\\x80\\x9d anti-drug campaign, was in attendance, wearing an American flag bandanna on his head.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans rammed forward President Donald Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s tax-cut bill on Tuesday in an abrupt, partisan committee vote that set up a full vote by the Senate as soon as Thursday, although some details of the measure remained unsettled. As disabled protesters shouted: â\\x80\\x9cKill the bill, donâ\\x80\\x99t kill us,â\\x80\\x9d in a Capitol Hill hearing room, the Senate Budget Committee, with no discussion, quickly approved the legislation on a 12-11 party-line vote that left Democrats fuming. Republican committee members quickly left the room after the vote as Democrats complained about a lack of discussion on a bill that would overhaul the U.S. tax code and add an estimated $1.4 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over 10 years. After the vote, Trump told reporters: â\\x80\\x9cI think weâ\\x80\\x99re going to get it passed,â\\x80\\x9d adding that it would have some adjustments.   Republicans are hurrying to move their complex tax legislation forward, hoping to avoid the protracted infighting that doomed their effort to repeal Obamacare four months ago. Since Trump took office in January, he and fellow Republicans in command of both chambers of Congress have approved no major legislation, a fact they want to change before facing voters in the 2018 congressional elections. If the Senate approves its tax measure later this week, it would need to be reconciled with a version already approved by the House of Representatives before anything could be sent to the White House for Trump to sign into law. Republican leaders conceded that they had yet to round up the votes needed for passage in the Senate, where they hold a narrow 52-48 majority. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a challenging exercise,â\\x80\\x9d Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said at a news conference. Democrats have called the Republican tax plan a giveaway to corporations and the rich. The Senate bill would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent after a one-year delay. It would impose a onetime, cut-rate tax on corporationsâ\\x80\\x99 foreign profits, while exempting future foreign profits from U.S. taxation. Tax rates for many individuals and families would also be cut temporarily before rising back to their previous levels in 2025. Key tax breaks would also be curbed or eliminated, making the bill a mixed bag for some middle-class families. Some taxes paid by wealthy Americans would be repealed. Wall Street moved higher on the news that the bill would move to a full Senate vote, with the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX index closing up a little over 1 percent. As written, the bill would widen the U.S. budget deficit by an estimated $1.4 trillion over 10 years. Republicans maintain that gap would be narrowed by additional economic growth. Senator Bob Corker, one of few remaining Republican fiscal hawks in Congress, said he worked out a deal satisfying his concerns that the tax cuts add too much to the national debt. He said the bill would be modified to automatically raise tax revenues if growth targets were not reached. â\\x80\\x9cWe got a commitment that puts us in a pretty good place,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Although details were not immediately available, Corker said he expected more information to come out on Thursday as part of the bill. The concession immediately drew a detractor as Republican Senator John Kennedy told reporters he â\\x80\\x9cwould rather drink weed killer than vote for the thing,â\\x80\\x9d adding: â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t like voting for automatic tax increases.â\\x80\\x9d  The Corker concession was one of several lingering uncertainties in the bill that Senate aides said would be nailed down as the measure neared a floor vote. Republican Senator Susan Collins, who remains undecided on how she will vote on the bill, said â\\x80\\x9cproductive discussionsâ\\x80\\x9d continued and that she would offer an amendment preserving the $10,000 deduction for property tax payments. The deduction is in the House bill, but not the Senate version.     Republican Senator Ron Johnson voted for the bill in the Budget Committee, even though he had said it did not cut taxes deeply enough for some non-corporate businesses. The final version could address his concerns. Aides said tax writers were working to change the tax rate for non-corporate businesses, preserve an individual deduction for property tax payments, and incorporate Corkerâ\\x80\\x99s tax revenue idea. Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley told MSNBC that the Corker concession was â\\x80\\x9can absolute gimmickâ\\x80\\x9d that could be undermined later. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s just a justification to let those who have argued that they donâ\\x80\\x99t believe in increasing the deficit actually vote for a bill which does exactly that,â\\x80\\x9d Merkley said. As the tax fight played out, a new battle opened on another front as Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi skipped a White House meeting with Trump to discuss spending, immigration and other issues after Trump criticized them on Twitter. Lawmakers must renew government funding before it expires on Dec. 8 or risk a shutdown. Democrats hope to use their leverage on the budget issue to renew protections for young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children. ',\n",

We will see. \\nAlready, he has made some â\\x80\\x9cerrors.â\\x80\\x9d The appointment of Mike Pompeo as CIA director is a bad move. Pompeo, as a congressman, introduced the Dark Act, which now prevents the states from requiring GMO labels on food. And he favors the death sentence for Edward Snowden. \\nMultiple media outlets are reporting that Trump will not attempt to prosecute Hillary Clinton. This is on the level of lowering the window shades for a vampire as dawn breaks. Hillary was certainly guilty in the email case, and the Clinton Foundation is a pay-for-play money laundering operation of global proportionsâ\\x80\\x94a private and parallel State Department, in which cash is the only standard for â\\x80\\x9cdiplomacy.â\\x80\\x9d And these charges are mere low-hanging fruit on the Clinton crime family tree. \\nPursuing justice is supposed to be a Trump hallmark. \\nPolitics in the Matrix is a tap dance and a shuffle. Deals and compromises are made all the way along the line. Washington and its media allies suck their very life juices from those deals. Like some fungus, they thrive in the dark every-day corruption of This traded for That. In many ways, Trump exclaimed he was above the game. The deals he was going to make would all be on the side of benefiting Americaâ\\x80\\x94so he has a price to pay for asserting he was most definitely a different character on the political scene. \\nThat unbridled assertion was what drove huge numbers of people to show up at his rallies all over the country. They wanted an outsider who had a serious ax to grind with Washington and the media. They wanted him to be angry and outragedâ\\x80\\x94because they were, too. They didnâ\\x80\\x99t want a great healer, because justice comes before healing. \\nMany of them had felt the effects of Globalism and its grotesque trade treaties. They were out of work, and he was going to bring back jobs. But that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t their only motivation. They knew their jobs had been stolen by anti-American elites, and they wanted the sword of justice to fall on those elites. They knew Hillary Clinton was an arch-Globalist. \\nFor these millions of Trump supporters, forgiving and forgetting and moving on isnâ\\x80\\x99t presidential. It smells bad. They were never part of the glazed-over New Age crowd, and they arenâ\\x80\\x99t now. The cheese-glob â\\x80\\x9ccoming togetherâ\\x80\\x9d isnâ\\x80\\x99t in their lexicon. They donâ\\x80\\x99t view anger as a character defect or a â\\x80\\x9ccompensatoryâ\\x80\\x9d response that traces back into early childhood. They want bad people to pay for their crimes. \\nHillary Clinton would be at the top of their list. Helping her heal is a sick joke. They want her in prison where she belongs. They know her constant vapid calls for â\\x80\\x9cnational unityâ\\x80\\x9d during the campaign were a straight-out con, a cover for her lust for power. \\nThey see nothing redeeming about her. Itâ\\x80\\x99s simple: she fights the good and embraces evil. Therefore, she should be punished. \\nDoing so would set an example and a course for the Trump administration: we donâ\\x80\\x99t back away, we donâ\\x80\\x99t back down. We arenâ\\x80\\x99t separating â\\x80\\x9ccampaign talkâ\\x80\\x9d from presidential action. Weâ\\x80\\x99re not trying to make that phony distinction. \\nIf Trump prosecuted Hillary to the full extent of the law, then of course the owls would come out hooting: heâ\\x80\\x99s vengeful; he canâ\\x80\\x99t let go; heâ\\x80\\x99s mean; heâ\\x80\\x99s spiteful; heâ\\x80\\x99s a cruel sadist; this goes beyond any civilized sense of propriety befitting a real leader. \\nYes? And? So? \\nSo what? \\nIs Trump the same man now that he was when he was campaigning? \\nEven asking that question seems naÃ¯ve, because of course we know all politicians rearrange themselves after they win a victory. But Trump portrayed himself as very, very different. He stood on that difference. He celebrated it. He reveled in it. He took great pleasure in it. \\nNow, he has to pay the price. \\nHis supporters donâ\\x80\\x99t want to hear some garbled nonsense about how prosecuting Hillary would create a giant distraction from the job of leading the country. Trumpâ\\x80\\x99s whole campaign was a distraction from politics as usual. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what gave him strength. \\nProsecuting Hillary Clinton now would be counter-intuitive and outrageous, and therefore it would be the most Trumpian thing Trump could do. \\nIt would give him more support from his millions of people. \\nAnd it would be right and correct and it would deliver justice where justice has been needed for a very long time. \\nAnd when the whole host of sordid details about Hillaryâ\\x80\\x99s crimes came spilling out into the light, people who pride themselves on being in the camp of the â\\x80\\x9cbeautiful and virtuousâ\\x80\\x9d would realize who they have been defending. \\nIt would provide a valuable lesson, and the price of admittance to that show would trump the decades of waiting America has endured in the case of The People vs. Hillary Clinton. \\nThis case has now been canceled. \\nDonald Trump achieved two great things in his presidential campaign: he stopped Hillary Clinton from occupying the White House, and he ran against the media by attacking them mercilessly.

       " 'Since Donald Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee for president, and the Democratic primary season isn t nearly as close to over as the Republican primary season, Trump ought to be spending his time trying to unite his party and gather as much support as possible. Instead, he s still acting like he s in the thick of the primaries.At a rally in Anaheim, he attacked South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley for endorsing Marco Rubio; Jeb Bush for having low energy (what?); and Mitt Romney for being a  choker.  He also said that Romney was stupid, and  choked like a dog. What month are we in now? He thinks it s still January, apparently.Those three haven t endorsed him yet, so obviously, in Trump s dimension, the way to get their endorsements is to alienate them. House Speaker Paul Ryan still hasn t endorsed Trump either, and Trump has been busy been attacking him on his favorite social media platform, Twitter. One has to wonder how he thinks he ll be well-positioned to win the presidency and work with Congress if the Speaker of the U.S. House can t stand him.At a rally in New Mexico on Tuesday, he attacked New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez because she wouldn t endorse him too. Martinez is the first Latina governor in U.S. history, the first female governor of New Mexico, and chair of the Republican Governors  Association. He slammed Martinez on Tuesday night, saying: We have got to get your governor to get going. She s got to do a better job. Okay? Your governor has got to do a better job. She s not doing the job. Hey! Maybe I ll run for governor of New Mexico. I ll get this place going. She s not doing the job. We ve got to get her moving. Come on: Let s go, governor. He went on to lie about New Mexico getting flooded with Syrian refugees, and basically acting like Martinez is his opponent. It s sad, and also hilarious in a way, because one would think he d want to secure as many endorsements as possible now, especially those of people as important as Martinez and Paul Ryan.Trump doesn t even hear the GOP s calls for him to try and unite the party   they may as well not exist. He thinks unity is a nice pipe dream, but not necessary for him, and really, who cares about healing rifts that run across the entire U.S., right? It s the same with the calls for him to act more presidential. He s stuck in the past. Either that, or he s out for the blood of everyone who s ever wronged him, which is likely the reason he s stuck in the past.Soon, he s going to have to face off against either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. What will he do then, should he still have some prominent Republicans who continue to refuse to endorse him? General election season will be mighty interesting if he doesn t get with the program here. More than 60 percent of Americans already view him unfavorably, and this attitude could further alienate Republicans and Democrats alike.

       " 'PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Elected officials of Cambodia s banned opposition party have begun handing over their duties after a court ordered the party dissolved, the government said on Monday. The Supreme Court outlawed the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) last week at the request of authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen s government in a move that prompted the United States to cut election funding and threaten more punitive steps. The party was banned after its leader, Kem Sokha, was arrested for alleged treason. The government says he sought to take power with American help. He rejects that allegation as politically motivated, to allow Hun Sen to extend his more than three decades in power in next year s general election. Among those told to give up their positions were councillors elected to communes in June, when the CNRP gained control of 40 percent of local councils, showing the electoral threat it posed to Hun Sen.  The implementation has been going smoothly,  the Interior Ministry s spokesman, Khieu Sopheak, told Reuters on Monday, adding that he did not know how long handover completion would take. The ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP) will take over nearly all of the communes won by the opposition. The CNRP s 55 seats in the 123-member parliament will be shared among six minor parties, the National Election Committee (NEC) said. It had been unable to contact one of the parties entitled to a seat because its headquarters was shut, it added. Three NEC members submitted a letter of resignation from the electoral body in protest at their party s dissolution, saying the redistribution of seats to other parties was  unconstitutional  and against  voters  will . The court has also banned 118 CNRP party members from politics for five years. Mu Sochua, a senior CNRP member who moved abroad shortly before the ban, said party officials met over the weekend outside Cambodia  to put together an action plan for the immediate future.    We reject the decision of the court,  she said, adding that Kem Sokha remained president and the party s former leader, Sam Rainsy, had rejoined it. Sam Rainsy had resigned in February, saying he feared the party would be banned if he did not, because of defamation convictions that he calls politically motivated and which pushed him to flee Cambodia in 2015. Across Cambodia, police took down CNRP signs outside party offices and on the streets. The interior ministry spokesman said the CNRP had helped by taking down its Phnom Penh headquarters sign itself. Rejecting the criticism from the United States over the dissolution of the opposition party and a crackdown on local rights groups and independent media, Hun Sen said on Sunday that Washington should cut off all aid for Cambodia.

       " 'We re not sure which of Judge Mary Murguia s qualifications for becoming a U.S. Supreme Court Justice would be more attractive to Obama. Could it be the fact that she, like Barack Obama can claim she is responsible for dismissing charges against a terrorist?  Perhaps her it s her sister s connection as a leader of La Raza, a government funded, radical activist group fighting to defend amnesty in America. Knowing Barry, it s likely both.The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge who previously dismissed terror charges against one of the Garland, Texas shooters has a connection to the controversial activist group, National Council of La Raza.Judge Mary Murguia, appointed by President Clinton and considered a potential nominee to the Supreme Court by President Obama, was the judge who dismissed government charges against Elton Simpson for suspected terrorism in 2011. On Sunday, Simpson attacked a free speech event in Garland, Texas depicting the Prophet Muhammad in cartoons.Daniel Greenfield cites evidence from the 2011 case:The FBI knew that Elton Simpson, one of the Garland Jihadists, was a threat and had attempted to lock him up after amassing evidence that he intended to go to Somalia as a terrorist. They had him on tape stating  that Allah loves an individual who is  out there fighting [non-Muslims]  and  If you get shot, or you get killed, it s [heaven] straight away.  Mr. Simpson then said  [Heaven] that s what we here for so why not take that route? Judge Murguia held then that the government was unable to prove Simpson mentioned violent jihad in his reasoning for traveling to Somalia.  That phrase is one made up by the Government, likely because it is aware that jihad in the Muslim religion does not necessarily imply violence,  she said, noted Greenfield.However, the LA Times previously noted that Judge Murguria s twin sister Janet Murguia leads a controversial group known as National Council of La Raza, which has been criticized as a racist hate group. It is the nation s largest Latino civil rights activist organization. La Raza is closely linked to the Obama Administration s amnesty efforts.Human Events, a conservative blog, previously reported that the mainstream media views La Raza  no more than a Hispanic Rotary Club.  But La Raza collected roughly $15.2 million in federal grants in 2005. Human Events also reported that undisclosed amounts of that money were used in  get-out-the-vote efforts supporting La Raza political positions. La Raza has been added to congressional hearings and  an anonymous senator even gave the Council of La Raza an extra $4 million in earmarked taxpayer money, supposedly for  housing reform,  according to Human Events. Moreover, Judge Murguria s brother, Carlos Murguria, helped coordinate the Immigration Amnesty Program prior to Clinton nominating him also for a judgeship, according to Front Page Magazine.Via: Bretibart News',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved an export license for Ukraine to buy certain light weapons and small arms from U.S. manufacturers, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Wednesday. Department records show Ukraine has bought small amounts of those types of weapons for several years, both before and after the 2014 Russian annexation of Ukraine s Crimean peninsula. The department notified Congress of the decision on Dec. 13, Nauert said, adding that the U.S. government was not selling the weapons directly to the Kiev government but was allowing Ukraine to buy from U.S. manufacturers.   Under the previous two administrations, the U.S. government has approved export licenses to Ukraine, so this is nothing new,  Nauert said. The license covers weapons in categories such as semi-automatic and automatic firearms up to, and including, .50 caliber weapons. It also includes combat shotguns, silencers, military scopes, and flash suppressors, as well as parts. Nauert said the U.S. government had not directly provided lethal defensive equipment to Ukraine, nor had it ruled out doing so. U.S. exporters can apply for direct commercial sales licenses at any time and those are reviewed by the State Department on a case-by-case basis, she said. ',\n",

       " 'GRAND RAPIDS, Mich./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President-elect Donald Trump returns to this factory town on Friday for a victory celebration, he will find a region that is already experiencing the manufacturing renaissance he promised on the campaign trail. With local factories employing more workers than any time since the late 1990s, assembly line jobs are not hard to find. Those that pay a decent wage, however, are harder to come by. â\\x80\\x9cWe can barely make ends meet and weâ\\x80\\x99re stuck going nowhere,â\\x80\\x9d said auto parts worker Michael Baum, 22, as he smoked a cigarette in the parking lot of a Family Dollar discount store.  Trump won the White House thanks to strong support from workers in Midwestern cities like Grand Rapids who have seen their living standards erode as the United States shed manufacturing jobs. He beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by a margin of 14 percent in the four counties that make up the Grand Rapids metropolitan area, helping him carry Michigan by a margin of 0.27 percent. Trump has promised to punish companies that shift work overseas, pressuring manufacturers like United Technologies Corp. to reverse their outsourcing plans. â\\x80\\x9cOur jobs are being stolen like candy from a baby,â\\x80\\x9d Trump said at a rally here the night before the Nov. 8 election.  Grand Rapids, a hub of furniture makers and auto parts suppliers, has not been immune to outsourcing. At least 488 people have lost their jobs over the past year as two manufacturers, Dematic Corp and Leon Automotive Interiors, have shifted work to other countries, U.S. Labor Department filings show. But new hiring has more than made up for those losses. The number of factory jobs in the region has grown by 40 percent since the depths of the recession in 2009, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and unemployment stands at 2.9 percent, well below the national average of 4.6 percent.  Local businesses now say their top concern is finding qualified workers, according to Rick Baker, president of the Grand Rapids Area Chamber of Commerce. Even as jobs have returned to Grand Rapids, earnings remain low. At $846 per week, average weekly wages in the region rank 46th among the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, BLS data show. The Heart of West Michigan United Way, a local charity, said demand for its services has remained steady over the past several years even as the economy has picked up.  While manufacturing helped lift millions of unskilled workers into the U.S. middle class in the 20th Century, that is no longer the case, said Lou Glazier, president of Michigan Future, a think tank that focuses on the stateâ\\x80\\x99s economy. Factories still pay good wages to workers who have specialized skills, such as welding or computer programing, but routine work no longer pays enough to cover living expenses, he said. Grand Rapids is â\\x80\\x9cparticipating in the old economy and doing well in it, in terms of jobs. Itâ\\x80\\x99s just that the economy is no longer producing high wages,â\\x80\\x9d Glazier said. While Trump and others blame global competition for the decline in factory work, automation has played a large role as well, economists say. The U.S. manufacturing sector has more than doubled output over the past 35 years even as it had shed one-third of its work force, according to the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re doing more today with the same amount of people that we had eight years ago,â\\x80\\x9d said Bob Roth, chief executive officer of RoMan Manufacturing, which make glass and electrical components.  At RoMan, assembly line workers start at $13 per hour but skilled workers can earn up to $30 an hour, Roth said. The company pays community college tuition for those who wish to upgrade their skills, but those who fail to improve their productivity enough to justify a higher wage within two years are fired, he said. Such prospects come as little consolation to workers like Baum, who are trying to figure out a way to boost their earnings on their own. For now, they are pinning their hopes on Trump. â\\x80\\x9cIf he can bring good paying jobs back to America,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll vote for him again.â\\x80\\x9d ',\n",

The ruling was a setback for Trump, whose attorneys argued that the documents contained trade secrets.Curiel s order came the same day that Trump railed against the judge at a boisterous San Diego rally for his handling of the case, in which students have alleged they were misled and defrauded. The trial is set for November.Trump, who previously questioned whether Curiel s Hispanic heritage made him biased due to Trump s support for building a wall on the Mexican border, said Friday that Curiel  happens to be, we believe, Mexican.  Trump called the judge a  hater of Donald Trump  who had  railroaded  him in the case. I think Judge Curiel should be ashamed of himself. I think it s a disgrace that he is doing this,   Trump said.Trump University was started in 2004 to offer courses in entrepreneurship under the Trump brand. Trump gave his blessing, according to court documents reported previously by The Post, becoming a 93 percent owner of the new enterprise.For entire story: The State.com ',\n",

       " 'Only one journalist has made it his mission to set the record straight about what really happened in Ferguson, MO on the day that Michael Brown was shot by Officer Darren Wilson. Every American needs to know about this man who faux  journalists  fear. Phelim McAleer is not a household name in America but he should be. He s challenged Matt Damon, Susan Sarandon and Yoko Ono and Sean Lennon on the false narrative they were promoting about the dangers of fracking in America.Watch Phelim bravely confront Susan Sarandon, Yoko Ono and Sean Lennon here:Watch Phelim expose the truth about who was helping to fund Matt Damon s anti fracking movie:While America was fixated on Jodi Arias  murder trial for the stabbing death of her boyfriend, Phelim McAleer was focused on another trial that was taking place simultaneously that involved the most prolific serial killer of our time, abortionist  Dr. Kermit Gosnell. The mainstream media intentionally ignored the story of Kermit Gosnell because the truth about the crimes he committed would  surely harm the reputation of the coveted abortion industry. Phelim, along with his wife Ann McElhinney and Magdalena Segieda raised over $2.2 million on Indiegogo that is being used to finance the production of a made for TV movie that will tell the true and horrific story of Kermit Gosnell.Phelim has bravely gone against the tide on so many issues the left has been either lying about or hiding for years. Because the mainstream media fears him however, it s likely you ve never even heard his name. Our goal is to change that.Phelim s latest project,  Ferguson  will be a live play that was written by journalist and documentary filmmaker Phelim McAleer and will be directed by Nick DeGruccio.  Ferguson  will run from April 26-29 at Los Angeles s Odyssey Theater. The reenactment of the controversial killing of Michael Brown on stage will allow Americans to actually view the facts based on the Grand Jury testimony. McAleer told the Washington Times:  It s going to be a dramatized stage reading. Witnesses are going to describe what happened, just as they described it in the grand jury room. We re going to have cast at least 13 people, playing 20 different characters. The documents that accompany the testimony will be on a large screen.  The audience will act as the jury and their votes will decide whether or not Ferguson officer Darren Wilson should have been indicted.YOU CAN HELP PHELIM MCALEER TELL THE TRUTH about what happened in Ferguson by contributing to the production of his play  Ferguson  by clicking here.FERGUSON will be the first dramatization of the controversial shooting that prompted public outcry and riots, with protesters claiming that white police officer Wilson shot black teenager Brown as he was surrendering with his hands up. Ferguson  is certain to confound and frustrate the leftist mainstream media who believes they have already cemented the  hands up don t shoot  narrative in the minds of Americans, regardless of the facts. I want to bring the truth about what happened that day to the stage,  explains McAleer, a celebrated journalist and filmmaker.  I think audience members will be very surprised, even shocked, when they hear the clear and unaltered truth about the events that took place on Aug. 9, 2014. There are a lot of myths and half-truths circulating about the shooting. FERGUSON is a chance to dispel these once and for all. Because the subject matter is so controversial, McAleer is launching the play as an independent production financed by crowdfunding. I know people want the truth to be told, so now they can be part of that process by going to FergusonThePlay.com to help make that happen,  he says.Helmed by multiple award-winning director Nick DeGruccio (The Laramie Project at both Laguna Playhouse and the Colony Theatre), FERGUSON will be staged as an evening of  verbatim  or  truth  theater, modeled on Tricycle Theatre s wildly popular Tribunal Plays series that has been a staple in London for over two decades. Verbatim theater is defined as  a play constructed from the precise words spoken by people interviewed about a particular event or topic.  In this case, the audience will hear unaltered witness testimony, exactly as the Ferguson grand jury heard it.Concludes McAleer, who covered numerous crime scenes and court cases while reporting on the troubles in Northern Ireland for The Irish News and UK SundayTimes,  I ve always been fascinated with the truth and with reexamining facts once the controversy and grief have abated. That is what I want to bring to the stage with FERGUSON. McAleer is also a producer and director of documentaries, including FrackNation, about fracking ( meticulously researched provocative    The New York Times;  briskly paced  [a] mischievous pic.    Variety); Not Evil Just Wrong, examining the devastating consequences of global warming hysteria; and Mine Your Own Business, exploring campaigns by foreign environmentalists against large scale mining projects in the developing world, which the UK Guardian described as  A Michael Moore-style documentary [that] casts the green movement as the influential villain of a worldwide campaign to block development and deny people the chance of jobs and a decent life. As a foreign correspondent with the Financial Times and The Economist, McAleer covered the post communist chaos in Eastern Europe, and he is a regular columnist for the New York Post. He has appeared on BBC, CNN and Fox News, among others.The provocative nature of McAleer s projects make traditional financing difficult. With FrackNation, McAleer bypassed traditional funding methods and instead turned to Kickstarter, a crowd-funding website. It was one of the most successful documentary campaigns in Kickstarter history: in just 60 days, 3,305 backers donated $212,265. His Indiegogo campaign for Gosnell was the site s most successful ever, with over 26,500 people contributing $2.25 million in 45 days. FERGUSON is also being financed through crowdfunding.

       " 'Ever since Texas laws closed about half of the state\\'s abortion clinics in 2013, researchers have been trying to understand just how much burden those laws place on women who are trying to access abortion. That\\'s important because the Supreme Court is now considering those laws as part of Whole Woman\\'s Health v. Hellerstedt, the court\\'s most consequential abortion case in decades. If it finds that the laws place an \"undue burden\" on women, they\\'ll likely be struck down.\\n\\nResearchers with the Texas Policy Evaluation Project (TxPEP), looking into exactly that, have already found that some women had to wait as much as three weeks longer for an appointment. Some women they\\'ve interviewed weren\\'t able to secure an abortion at all, due to the logistical and financial barriers.\\n\\nNow, TxPEP has published a significant study, in the American Journal of Public Health, on the effects of HB2, the omnibus anti-abortion bill that the Court could end up partially striking down. The study shows just how many burdens were placed on women as a result of the clinics closed by the law.\\n\\nResearchers surveyed 398 Texas women, comparing women whose nearest abortion clinic was closed in mid-2014 with those whose nearest clinic was still open in April 2013, shortly before the Texas legislature debated HB2.\\n\\nThe results were striking. Of the women surveyed, 38 percent lived in a zip code where the closest clinic was open in 2013 but closed in 2014.\\n\\nOne key finding: Women whose nearest clinic hadn\\'t closed had to travel an average of 22 miles, while women whose nearest clinic had closed traveled an average of 85 miles â\\x80\\x94 almost four times as far. And a quarter of women in the latter group had to travel more than 139 miles to get an abortion.\\n\\nThis was the case even six months after HB2 went into effect, when abortion providers would have had at least some time to adjust to the initial chaos of closures.\\n\\nWomen whose nearest clinics closed had a tougher time by just about every measure: They had to travel farther and pay more out of pocket for things like gas, hotels, and child care.\\n\\nThey were less likely to be able to access medication abortion instead of surgical abortion if they wanted it â\\x80\\x94 probably because Texas law requires four different doctors\\' visits for medication abortion, which is a lot tougher to manage when you live far away.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, they were also more likely to report that it was \"somewhat hard\" or \"very hard\" to get care.\\n\\nWomen whose nearest clinics closed also faced more burdens â\\x80\\x94 for instance, they were more likely to both travel more than 50 miles and spend more than $100 on the trip. Twenty-four percent of women in the closure group reported facing three or more different kinds of burdens, compared to just 4 percent of women whose clinics remained open.\\n\\nAnd the study only looked at women who eventually got their desired abortion â\\x80\\x94 so it couldn\\'t account for the women who weren\\'t able to get one at all because the burdens were too high.\\n\\n\"This study is unusual in its ability to assess multiple burdens imposed on women as a result of clinic closures, but it is important to note that the burdens documented here are not the only hardships that women experienced as a result of HB2,\" said study author Liza Fuentes in a statement.\\n\\nStrangely, there was no significant difference between the two groups of women in how far along they were in their pregnancy when they had an abortion. That\\'s inconsistent with other TxPEP research that found, after HB2 passed, a small but significant increase in second-trimester abortion procedures, which are not quite as safe and a lot more expensive compared to the first trimester procedures.\\n\\nBut that could be explained by a couple of things, the researchers wrote. Either the long wait times forced by HB2 are affecting everyone equally, or the differences were too small to show up in this study.\\n\\nIt\\'s still clear, the researchers said, that the clinic closures after HB2 passed \"resulted in significant burdens for women able to obtain care.\"',\n",

This is not an indictment of white people; this is an indictment of a system that perpetuates white supremacy and shelters our peers under the warm blanket of white privilege   all the while, we are left to freeze in our frigid reality of racist epithets, essentialist curriculum, and apathetic governance,  the letter read. In post-racial America, our classmates call us niggers from their pickup trucks in broad daylight. In post-racial America, we are berated by airborne bottles on our own campus. In post-racial America, we are told we have a chip on our shoulder. We are called everything but our name. Above all else, in post-racial America we are bombarded by the deafening silence that allows the centuries-old hum of white supremacy to grow louder,  it continued.  Silence is violence. Because Cornell is racist, and its Interfraternity Council is an alleged arm of the white supremacist system, Black Students United drew up a list of 12 demands that will help set things right.They include a system of mandatory coursework for all students that s focused on race, gender, discrimination, white privilege and other social justice causes from the perspective of  oppressed people,  as well as mandatory training for staff on the same issues.Black Students United want Psi Upsilon shut down and to use the building as  an adequate and appropriate space for the people of the Africa diaspora to utilize for programs of any kind, in perpetuity. The group also demands mandatory diversity and inclusion training for all greek members on campus, a special  minority liaison  position on the University Assembly, Cornell Health to hire at least two black psychologists and one black doctor in coming years, a new student-led dispute resolution process, and a limit on different types of black students admitted to the Ivy League school. We demand that Cornell Admissions to come up with a plan to actively increase the presence of underrepresented Black students on this campus. We define underrepresented Black students as Black Americans who have several generations (more than two) in this country,  the letter read.The problem is there are too many black students from other places outside of the U.S., Black Students United argued. The Black student population at Cornell disproportionately represents international or first-generation African or Caribbean students,  BSU wrote.  While these students have a right to flourish at Cornell, there is a lack of investment in Black students whose families were affected directly by the African Holocaust in America. Cornell must work to actively support students whose families have been impacted for generations by white supremacy and American fascism. The demands also include a call for an  Anti-Racism Institute  to  educate the campus and community about the horrors of white supremacy and political education,  among other things.',\n",
       " 'BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Elections for Iraq s Kurdistan region s presidency and parliament set for Nov. 1 will be delayed because political parties failed to present candidates, the head of the electoral commission Hendrean Mohammed told Reuters on Monday. Parties have been unable to focus on the elections because of turmoil that followed a referendum on Sept. 25 on Kurdish independence, a Kurdish MP said on condition of anonymity. Authorities in Baghdad as well as neighbors Iran and Turkey opposed the referendum that saw a clear independence majority.  Last week, Iraqi forces captured the oil city of Kirkuk and other territory claimed by the Kurds in retaliation for the referendum, dealing a severe blow to Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) President Masoud Barzani. The Kurdish electoral commission s Mohammed, speaking by phone from the KRG capital Erbil, in northern Iraq, said it is up to the Kurdistan region s parliament to fix a new date for the elections. The deadline to present candidates expired last week and was extended until Monday.  The current KRG presidency, held by Barzani since 2005, and parliament, elected in 2013, are expected to continue until new votes are held, he said. The loss of Kirkuk prompted calls from Gorran, the main opposition party to Barzani, for his resignation. Gorran, or the Change Movement, supports the right of Iraq s Kurds for self-determination but it opposed holding the referendum on Sept. 25, saying the timing was ill-chosen. ',\n",
       " 'A  JV team  threat Shaken by a daring U.S. military strike deep in ISIS territory, supporters of the extremist organization were vowing revenge for the killing of senior leader Abu Sayyaf or claiming the special operations mission never took place, a Vocativ analysis reveals. If they took Abu Sayyaf, we will take Obama,  one ISIS supporter posted in the hours after the raid near the eastern Syrian city of al-Amr.Translation: If your goal is killing Abu Sayyaf then our goal is killing Obama and the worshipers of the cross. We have attacks coming against you.Elite American commandos carried out the rare, overnight military operation, killing Sayyaf, capturing his wife, and freeing a Yezidi woman believed to have been held as their slave, the Pentagon said Saturday. Defense Secretary Ash Carter heralded the mission as a  significant blow  to the Islamic State.Vocativ analyzed social media across Syria in the wake of the strike and discovered some ISIS supporters claimed the news was U.S. propaganda timed to counter ISIS momentum after taking most of the Iraqi city of Ramadi this week. Others tweeted from outside the Syrian city of Raqqa vowing revenge for the strike, saying they heard explosions and helicopters.Carter said Sayyaf was responsible for directing many of the group s military activities and funding, directing its  illicit oil, gas, and financial operation.  No U.S. forces were killed or injured during the operation, which represented  another significant blow  to the group, Carter said.  And it is a reminder that the United States will never waver in denying safe haven to terrorists who threaten our citizens, and those of our friends and allies,  he continued in the statement.The mission included the arrest of Sayyaf s wife, Umm Sayyaf, and the freeing of the Yezidi woman. The trading of Yezidi women has been a major inducement and reward for ISIS fighters in the past. The Yezidis follow a strand of Islam that is rejected by mainstream Muslims as heretical. ISIS last year surrounded the Yezidis  villages in northern Iraq, killing and capturing dozens, and taking many of the girls and women as slaves. U.S. forces captured Umm Sayyaf, who we suspect is a member of ISIS, played an important role in ISIS s terrorist activities, and may have been complicit in what appears to have been the enslavement of a young Yezidi woman rescued last night,  Carter said. The White House said in a statement that Umm Sayyaf had been moved to a U.S. military detention facility in Iraq. The Yezidi woman would be freed.  We intend to reunite her with her family as soon as feasible,  Bernadette Meehan, the National Security Council spokeswoman, said in a statement.The operation was coordinated with Iraqi officials, but  the U.S. government did not coordinate with the Syrian regime, nor did we advise them in advance of this operation,  Ms. Meehan said.According to reports, a team of the Army s Delta Force troops traveled in Black Hawk helicopters and Osprey aircraft into al-Amr in eastern Syria. The Washington Post quoted an unnamed defense official who said a firefight broke out after the troops touched down near a building where Abu Sayyaf was believed to be, and that ISIS fighters tried to use women and children as human shields. It was a real fight,  the official told the Post, saying there was hand-to-hand fighting and  about a dozen militants were killed.  He told the Post that troops collected items that might prove useful intelligence.Via: Vocativ.com',\n",
       " 'It feels like almost every other week there is a new headline about Uber raising more money. â\\x80\\x9cUber Closes $1. 6 Billion in Financing. â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9cUber Turns to Saudi Arabia for $3. 5 Billion Cash Infusion. â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 Last week, we got this one: â\\x80\\x9cUber to Raise Up to $2 Billion in   Market. â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 If you add up all the money Uber has raised since it started in 2009  â\\x80\\x94   the idea was born when its founders became annoyed that they could not get a cab in Paris  â\\x80\\x94   the   app company is on its way to amassing a colossal $15 billion. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s real cash, not some     valuation. (That figure is $68 billion.) It has done all this while still managing to remain a private company, and its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, has insisted that a public offering is not coming soon. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m going to make sure it happens as late as possible,â\\x80\\x9d he has repeatedly said. Consider this: When Amazon went public in 1997, it raised $54 million and was valued at $438 million. So what exactly is Uber doing with all that money? And what does it say about Uber  â\\x80\\x94   and the financial markets  â\\x80\\x94   that the company has turned most recently to selling the equivalent of junk bonds? Yes, Uber has to finance an   war to gain market share in China and India. But there is more to it than that: Uberâ\\x80\\x99s   is seemingly part of an unspoken strategy to mark its territory. Every time Uber raises another $1 billion, venture capital investors and others may find it less attractive to back one of Uberâ\\x80\\x99s many rivals: Didi Chuxing, Lyft, Gett, Halo, Juno. In other words, Uberâ\\x80\\x99s   efforts have seemingly become part of the contest: Itâ\\x80\\x99s not just a rivalry over customers and drivers itâ\\x80\\x99s a war of attrition, a mad scramble to starve the competition of cash. At the moment, Uberâ\\x80\\x99s success has had the opposite effect: It has spawned a long list of rivals, big and little guys who say, â\\x80\\x9cWe can do it too. â\\x80\\x9d But over time, as the smaller competitors run out of cash  â\\x80\\x94   after heavily subsidizing riders in an effort to steal business from Uber  â\\x80\\x94   venture capitalists should be less inclined to put up even more cash to go up against Fortress Uber. Uberâ\\x80\\x99s   arms race comes against the backdrop of falling valuations for many Silicon Valley unicorns  â\\x80\\x94   private companies worth $1 billion or more. So thereâ\\x80\\x99s clearly a rush to take the money while itâ\\x80\\x99s still available. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s not the second inning or even the sixth, itâ\\x80\\x99s the 14th inning in a   baseball game,â\\x80\\x9d Bill Gurley, the famed venture capitalist who has as a stake in Uber and sits on its board, warned on his blog about the state of Silicon Valley. He alerted investors about unicorns that come to them seeking funds: â\\x80\\x9cYou are not being invited to a special dance, you are being approached because you are the lender of last resort. â\\x80\\x9d The   industry has long been seen as a   game because of the â\\x80\\x9cnetwork effectâ\\x80\\x9d: The more customers sign up for Uber, the more drivers sign up, making it tougher for rivals to mount competition. There will most likely be only one or two significant players in any given market. (More on that in a moment, because there might be some cracks emerging in that point of view.) The question is whether the financing game is   too. And the even larger question is whether Uberâ\\x80\\x99s   capital investments could ultimately act as a deterrent to investors who might consider supporting Uberâ\\x80\\x99s competitors: Will they look at Uberâ\\x80\\x99s balance sheet  â\\x80\\x94   it has some $6 billion in cash just sitting there  â\\x80\\x94   and throw up a white flag? So far, Uber is clearly winning the valuation game: It is worth more than virtually all of its rivals combined. But Uber still has formidable competition in the   arena: Didi, the market leader in China that is engaged in a   battle with Uber, just raised $7 billion,  some of which came from Apple. (Mr. Kalanick, too, was hoping to raise money from Apple and had planned to meet with executives at the iPhone maker the same week Apple announced its investment in Didi.) Perhaps strangely, several of the same investors that have backed Uber are also backing Didi in China, including BlackRock and Tiger Global, so it is hard to say that one service is deterring investment in the other  â\\x80\\x94   at least not yet. (It is worth noting that among the investor class, some may be hoping that Uber might one day merge its Chinese operation with Didi.) Uberâ\\x80\\x99s most recent   effort  â\\x80\\x94   focused on the leveraged loan market  â\\x80\\x94   aims to avoid diluting the current base of shareholders. It has hired Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to sell about $2 billion in loans. By avoiding a traditional round of financing, the company also avoids the company having to risk trying to sell itself at an even higher valuation. Given the remarkably low interest rates, investors looking for yield may buy into Uber. Uber says it is profitable in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Australia  â\\x80\\x94   if you factor out taxes and interest payments. The challenge for Uber is breaking into China and India, perhaps the two largest markets in the world. Uber is currently on track to lose about $2 billion annually in those markets as it heavily subsidizes customers and drivers to gain market share. That means that Uber will have to pay up for the financing. But if Uberâ\\x80\\x99s valuation continued to grow, it would be a bargain compared with the value of the equity. Uber is hoping to sell debt with a yield of about 4 or 4. 5 percent. Uberâ\\x80\\x99s I. P. O. will probably come to pass in the next three to four years. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s because some of the convertible debt it previously issued provides investors with a special discount if the company has not gone public by then. But by 2018 or 2019, at the rate Uber is going, who knows how much money Uber will have raised. It may need none. The question is whether it will have starved all of its competitors along the way.',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON  â\\x80\\x94   The Supreme Court on Monday seemed sharply divided during an extended argument over a challenge to President Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s plan that would shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to work in the country legally. A   deadlock seemed a real possibility, one that would leave in place an appeals court ruling that blocks the plan and deny Mr. Obama the chance to revive it while he remains in office. A tie vote would set no Supreme Court precedent and therefore would allow a renewed challenge to the plan once the court is back at full strength. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. â\\x80\\x99s questions were deeply skeptical of the administrationâ\\x80\\x99s position. They appeared to signal that he would not join the courtâ\\x80\\x99s four more liberal members in dismissing the case on the ground that the challengers had not suffered injuries giving them standing to sue. A ruling based on standing would be a victory for the administration. The case, brought by Texas and 25 other states, could still produce a significant ruling on presidential power and immigration policy in the midst of an election campaign in which both issues have been prominent. A loss for Mr. Obama would vindicate Republican accusations that he has acted lawlessly in exceeding the limits of presidential power and has not done enough to secure the nationâ\\x80\\x99s borders. A victory for him would uphold one of the central legacies of his presidency and affect the lives of countless immigrants. Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s top appellate lawyer, opened the arguments with a vigorous defense of Mr. Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s authority to set priorities for immigration enforcement. He was quickly challenged by Chief Justice Roberts. â\\x80\\x9cCould the president grant deferred removal to every unlawfully present alien in the United States right now?â\\x80\\x9d the chief justice asked skeptically. Mr. Verrilli said there were statutory constraints that would prevent the president from doing so. Mr. Verrilli also argued that Texas had not suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gave it standing to sue. The chief justice said the administration had given Texas an impossible choice, â\\x80\\x9ca real  . â\\x80\\x9d Texas says it has standing to sue because it would be costly for the state to give driverâ\\x80\\x99s licenses to immigrants affected by the federal policy. Mr. Verrilli said the state could simply change its law to deny driverâ\\x80\\x99s licenses to the immigrants. â\\x80\\x9cYou would sue them instantly,â\\x80\\x9d Chief Justice Roberts responded, meaning that the federal government would file a lawsuit challenging Texasâ\\x80\\x99 unequal treatment of immigrants affected by the program. Mr. Verrilli said that was probably so but that such a suit might not succeed. The answer did not seem to satisfy Chief Justice Roberts, who suggested that the choice between incurring a budget shortfall and facing a lawsuit from the federal government was enough to establish standing. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, on the other hand, twice suggested that Texas could have filed a different kind of lawsuit, one in which its standing would not be in question. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that â\\x80\\x9cnearly 11 million unauthorized aliens are here in the shadows. â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re here whether we want them or not,â\\x80\\x9d she said. But Justice Kennedy questioned whether the president can defer deportations for millions of people without specific congressional authorization. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s as if the president is defining the policy and the Congress is executing it,â\\x80\\x9d Justice Kennedy said. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s just upside down. â\\x80\\x9d The case, United States v. Texas, No.   concerns a program intended to allow more than four million unauthorized immigrants who are the parents of citizens or of lawful permanent residents to apply for a program sparing them from deportation and providing them work permits. The program, announced in November 2014, was called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA. Mr. Verrilli told the justices that it addressed â\\x80\\x9ca pressing humanitarian concern in avoiding the breakup of families that contain U. S. citizen children. â\\x80\\x9d Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked if the president could simply open the nationâ\\x80\\x99s borders. Mr. Verrilli said that was â\\x80\\x9ca million miles from where we are now. â\\x80\\x9d That comment prompted Justice Kennedy to jump in. â\\x80\\x9cWell, itâ\\x80\\x99s four million people from where we are now,â\\x80\\x9d he said, referring to the number of immigrants affected by Mr. Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s plan. â\\x80\\x9cWhat weâ\\x80\\x99re doing is defining the limits of discretion,â\\x80\\x9d Justice Kennedy said of the courtâ\\x80\\x99s role in determining the lawfulness of the plan. â\\x80\\x9cAnd it seems to me that that is a legislative, not an executive act. â\\x80\\x9d Scott A. Keller, Texasâ\\x80\\x99 solicitor general, said Mr. Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s plan was unprecedented and unlawful. He faced skeptical questions from the courtâ\\x80\\x99s more liberal members about whether his state had standing. Justice Sotomayor wondered why it would cost more to issue more driverâ\\x80\\x99s licenses. â\\x80\\x9cWhy canâ\\x80\\x99t you just let people wait on line?â\\x80\\x9d she asked. A different line, for one of the coveted red tickets that allow members of the public into the Supreme Court for the oral arguments, stretched around the block on Monday. Some people had been camping in front of the court since Friday night, eager for a chance to witness history. Groups of young people walked up and down the sidewalk holding banners and chanting mantras like â\\x80\\x9cSÃ\\xad se puede,â\\x80\\x9d Spanish for â\\x80\\x9cYes we can. â\\x80\\x9d Thomas Pittman, a retired firefighter and a deacon at Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton, said he was interested in the effects the case might have on the presidential race. â\\x80\\x9cI think itâ\\x80\\x99s going to have a major impact on the election, due to the fact that Trump wants to deport people and close our borders down,â\\x80\\x9d he said, referring to the Republican   Donald J. Trump. Mr. Obama has said he took action after years of frustration with Republicans in Congress who had repeatedly refused to support bipartisan Senate legislation to update immigration laws. A coalition of 26 states, led by Texas, promptly challenged the plan, accusing the president of ignoring administrative procedures for changing rules and of abusing the power of his office by sidestepping Congress. If the Supreme Court upholds Mr. Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s actions, the White House has vowed to move quickly to set up the program and begin enrolling immigrants before his successor takes over early next year. Democratic presidential candidates have said they would continue the program, but most of the Republicans in the race have vowed to dismantle it and redouble immigration enforcement. Mr. Keller, Texasâ\\x80\\x99 lawyer, acknowledged that the president has wide authority over whom to deport. â\\x80\\x9cIn this case,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cgiven that they are removing 400, 000 people a year, we admit that they could do forbearance from removal. But what they canâ\\x80\\x99t do is grant authorization to be in the country. â\\x80\\x9d He said the statesâ\\x80\\x99 quarrel was with what he called a blanket grant of â\\x80\\x9clawful presenceâ\\x80\\x9d to millions of immigrants, entitling them to various benefits. Mr. Verrilli, the administrationâ\\x80\\x99s lawyer, said the term â\\x80\\x9clawful presenceâ\\x80\\x9d had been misunderstood. Chief Justice Roberts asked him whether he was slicing things a little too fine. â\\x80\\x9cLawfully present does not mean youâ\\x80\\x99re legally present?â\\x80\\x9d the chief justice asked. â\\x80\\x9cCorrect,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Verrilli responded. Justice Alito said that response was mystifying. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m just talking about the English language,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI just donâ\\x80\\x99t understand it. â\\x80\\x9d But Justice Elena Kagan said the term â\\x80\\x9clawful presenceâ\\x80\\x9d was a red herring, suggesting that the administration could â\\x80\\x9chave done the exact same thing without using that phrase. â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " ' Dirty Jobs  host Mike Rowe went off on a guy who claimed Rowe is a  white nationalist . The usual happy-go-lucky Rowe was clearly ticked when he wrote back to Chuck Adkins.Chuck Adkins asked Rowe:  One of the tenants of white nationalism is that college educated people are academic elitists. Comment? No? I m not surprised. You never take a political stand because you don t want to alienate anybody. Its bad for business. I get it. But there is a current of anti intellectualism in this country   promoted by Republicans. Those people love you, and they think your initiative is their initiative. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is kickin our ass academically. Rowe responded with a blistering rebuke of Adkins and the liberal media: Since we re being candid, allow me to say how much I dislike your post. Everything about it annoys me   your smug and snarky tone, your appalling grammar, your complete lack of evidence to support your claims, and of course, the overarching logical fallacy that informs your entire position,  Rowe wrote.  What really bugs me though, is the fact that you re not entirely wrong. It s true; I haven t shared any political opinions this week, in part anyway, because doing so might very well be  bad for business. What can I say? I work for half-a-dozen different companies, none of whom pay me to share my political opinions. I run a non-partisan foundation, I m about to launch a new show on Facebook, and I m very aware that celebrities pay a price for opening their big fat gobs. Gilbert Gottfried, Kathy Griffin, Colin Kaepernick, Milo Yiannopoulos even that guy from Google who just got himself fired for mouthing off. There s no getting around it   the first amendment does not guarantee the freedom to speak without consequences. And really, that s fine by me,  he continued. So no   I m not going to share my personal feelings about Charlottesville, President Trump, or the current effort to remove thousands of statues of long dead soldiers from the public square. Not just because it s  bad for business,  but because it s annoying. I can t think of a single celebrity whose political opinion I value, and I m not going to assume the country feels any differently about mine,  Rowe wrote.  So, rather than blow myself up, or chime in with all the obvious observations about the cowardly scum in the pointy hats, I m going to talk instead about my belief that comments like yours pose a far greater threat to the future of our country than the existence of a memorial to Thomas Jefferson, or a monument to George Washington. Ready? Then Rowe started in on Adkins  insinuations. You say that White Nationalists believe that everyone who goes to college is an  academic elite.  You then say that Republicans promote  anti-intellectualism.  You offer no proof to support either claim, but it really doesn t matter   your statements successfully connect two radically different organizations by alleging a shared belief,  Rowe said.  Thus, White Nationalists and The Republican Party suddenly have something in common   a contempt for higher education. Then, you make it personal. You say that Republicans  love  me because they believe that my initiative and  their  initiative are one and the same. But of course,  their  initiative is now the same initiative as White Nationalists. He continued  Very clever. Without offering a shred of evidence, you ve implied that Republicans who support mikeroweWORKS do so because they believe I share their disdain for all things  intellectual.  And poof   just like that, Republicans, White Nationalists, and mikeroweWORKS are suddenly conflated, and the next thing you know, I m off on a press tour to disavow rumors of my troubling association with the Nazis! Far-fetched? Far from it,  Rowe continued.  That s how logical fallacies work. A flaw in reasoning or a mistaken belief undermines the logic of a conclusion, often leading to real-world consequences. And right now, logical fallacies are not limited to the warped beliefs of morons with tiki torches, and other morons calling for  more dead cops.  Logical fallacies are everywhere. Not near done, Rowe wrote,  As I type this, a Democrat on CNN is making an argument that says,  because Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, those Republicans now opposed to tearing down his memorial are  pro-slavery,  and therefore aligned with the modern day KKK.  That s a logical fallacy. Over on Fox, a Republican is arguing that  any Democrat who has not yet condemned the Senator from Missouri for publicly wishing that Donald Trump be assassinated, is guilty of wishing for the exact same thing.  That s a logical fallacy. Yesterday, on The Science Channel, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, a noted astronomer, tweeted that the ability of scientists to accurately predict the solar eclipse, was proof that predictions of global warming were also accurate. That s a logical fallacy. Then Rowe turned the tables on his accuser, continuing,  Want to hear another one? Imagine something like this, unfolding over on MSNBC. Good Evening, America, our top story tonight  Chuck Atkins is a racist! Why? Because he can t spell. Just look at his grammar! In a recent post on Mike Rowe s Facebook page, Mr. Atkins, while bemoaning America s global academic standing, not only misspelled  elitist,  he used  tenants  when he meant  tenets.  He neglected to use a hyphen in  anti-intellectual,  and he misplaced several commas and apostrophes! But why is he a racist, you ask? Simple. Because everyone knows racists are ignorant. Chuck Atkins is clearly a poor speller. Poor spelling and grammar are signs of ignorance. Ergo   Chuck Atkins is a racist! Boom! The matter is settled! There s not much we can do about the news, but here on Facebook, I think we can do better. This isn t Twitter,  Rowe said.  We re not limited to a few inflammatory sentences and a flurry of emojis. Take a moment, Chuck. Think. Make a rational argument. Otherwise, just link us to a cat video. People love those, and they re almost never  bad for business.  (Unless of course, the cat gets hurt. People hate that.) Just don t assume that people will care about your beliefs, if you re not willing to back them up with some relevant facts and a rational conclusion. Here, for instance, are a few facts that matter to me, with respect to my foundation and the recurring charge of  fostering anti-intellectualism. Rowe then defended his charitable work, writing,  mikeroweWORKS is a PR campaign for the skilled trades. For the last nine years, we ve partnered with numerous trade schools, raised millions of dollars for work-ethic scholarships, and called attention to millions of jobs that don t require a four-year degree. But that doesn t mean we re  anti-intellectual.  We re not even  anti-college.  We simply reject the popular notion that a four-year degree is the best path for the most people. And we re hardly alone. Millions of reasonable people   Republicans and Democrats alike   are worried that our universities are doing a poor job of preparing students for the real world. They re worried about activist professors, safe spaces, the rising cost of tuition, a growing contempt for history, and a simmering disregard of the first amendment. These people are concerned that our universities   once beacons of free speech   now pander to a relatively small percentage of students who can t tolerate any political opinion that challenges their own. And they re concerned   deeply concerned   that millions of good jobs are currently vacant that don t require a four-year degree, or any of the catastrophic debt that comes with it. Returning to the original attack, Rowe concluded,  Again   these are not the concerns of  anti-intellectuals.  They are the concerns of people who care about the future of the country. I don t know how many of these people are Republicans, but I can assure you that no one who actually supports my initiative is remotely confused about my feelings on education, because I ve been crystal clear on that topic from the very beginning. To quote Thomas Jefferson, (while I still can,)  If a nation expects to be ignorant and free and live in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.  On this point, my foundation does not equivocate. In other words, Chuck, I have no idea what The White Nationalists think about my efforts, or the Republicans, the Democrats, the elitists, the Italians, the Presbyterians, the unions, or the self-proclaimed anti-intellectuals. And really, I couldn t care less. My question is, why do you? Mike PS. Ok, I ve just re-read this, (in a desperate search for typos,) and I want to apologize for pointing out that you re a lousy speller. This is probably not the time to trot out The Grammar Nazi, but your tenor and tone pissed me off, and I responded in my own snarky way. Sorry,  he wrote. PPS Maybe this is how political correctness begins? Maybe we start by correcting each other s grammar, and then move on to the business of correcting everything else? Today a missing hyphen, tomorrow a missing monument. Or, maybe not,  he concluded.',\n",

      "Please enter the news text you want to verify: \" What Is At Stake In The Election By Paul Craig Roberts  Here Are The Presstitutes Who Control AmericanÂ’s Minds : I just heard an NPR presstitute declare that Texas, a traditional sure thing for Republicans was up for grabs in the presidential election. Little wonder if this report on Zero Hedge is correct. Apparently, the voting machines are already at work stealing the election for Killary. From my long experience in journalism, I know the American public is not very sharp. Nevertheless, it is difficult for me to believe that Americans, whose jobs, careers, and the same for their children and grandchildren, have been sold out by the elites who Hillary represents would actually vote for her. It makes no sense. If this were the case, how did Trump get the Republican nomination despite the vicious presstitute campaign against him? It seems obvious that the majority of Americans who have been suffering terribly at the hands of the One Percent who own Hillary lock, stock, and barrel, will not vote for the people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren. Furthermore, if TrumpÂ’s election is as impossible as the presstitutes tell usÂ—HillaryÂ’s win is 93% certain according to the latest presstitute pronouncementÂ—the vicious 24/7 attacks on Trump would be pointless. WouldnÂ’t they? Why the constant, frenetic, vicious attacks on a person who has no chance? There are reports that a company associated with Hillary backer George Soros is supplying the voting machines to 16 states, including states that determine election outcomes. I do not know that these reports are correct. However, I do know for a fact that the oligarchic interests that rule America are opposed to Trump being elected President for the simple reason that they are unsure that they would be able to control him. It is hard to believe that dispossessed Americans will vote for Hillary, the representative of those who have dispossessed them, when Trump says he will re-empower the dispossessed. Hillary has denigrated ordinary Americans who, she says, she is so removed from by her wealth that she doesnÂ’t even know who they are. Clearly, Hillary, paid $675,000 by Goldman Sachs for three 20-minute speeches, is not a representative of the people. She represents the One Percent whose policies have flushed the prospects of ordinary Americans down the toilet. What is really disturbing is the pretense by the presstitute scum that TrumpÂ’s lewd admiration for female charms is deemed more important than the prospect of nuclear war. At no time during the presidential primaries or during the current presidential campaign has it been mentioned that Russia is being assaulted daily by propaganda, threatened by military buildups, and being convinced that the United States and its European vassals are planning an attack. A threatened Russia, made insecure by inexplicable hostility and Western propaganda, is a danger manufactured by the neoconservative supporters of Hillary Clinton. If the American people are really so unbelievably stupid that they think lewd remarks about women are more important than avoiding nuclear war, the American people are too stupid to exist. They will deserve the mushroom clouds that will wipe them and everyone else off the face of the earth. Donald Trump is the only candidate in the primaries and the general election who has said that he sees no point in conflict with Russia when Putin has shown nothing but desire to work things out to mutual advantage. In contrast, Hillary has declared the thrice-elected president of Russia to be Â“the new HitlerÂ” and has threatened Russia with military action. Hillary talks openly about regime change in Russia. Surely, in a free media at least one person in the print and TV media would raise this most important of all points. But where have you seen it? Only in my columns and a few others in the alternative media. In other words, we are about to have an election in which the important issue has played no role. And yet allegedly we are the exceptional, indispensable people, a peopleÂ’s democracy protected by a free press. In truth, this mythical description of America is merely a cloak for the rule of the Oligarchs. And the Oligarchs are risking life on earth for their continual supremacy.
